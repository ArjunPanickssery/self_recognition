Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I'll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.  Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest \u00bb . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer's \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: \"I just think I'm going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.

Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the \"forgotten floor,\" where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the \"forgotten floor.\" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually \"avoidable felonies.\" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' \u00bb . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. \"I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!\" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered \"lunatics\" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the \"forgotten floor\"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served.

And there's cars in the water, there's cars on fire. The whole bridge is down.\" He said his back was injured but he determined he could move around. \"I realized there was a school bus right next to me, and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge. They were yelling, screaming, bleeding. I think there were some broken bones.\"  Watch a driver describe his narrow escape \u00bb . At home when he heard about the disaster, Dr. John Hink, an emergency room physician, jumped into his car and rushed to the scene in 15 minutes. He arrived at the south side of the bridge, stood on the riverbank and saw dozens of people lying dazed on an expansive deck. They were in the middle of the Mississippi River, which was churning fast, and he had no way of getting to them. He went to the north side, where there was easier access to people. Ambulances were also having a hard time driving down to the river to get closer to the scene. Working feverishly, volunteers, EMTs and other officials managed to get 55 people into ambulances in less than two hours. Occasionally, a pickup truck with a medic inside would drive to get an injured person and bring him back up even ground, Hink told CNN. The rescue effort was controlled and organized, he said; the opposite of the lightning-quick collapse. \"I could see the whole bridge as it was going down, as it was falling,\" Babineau said. \"It just gave a rumble real quick, and it all just gave way, and it just fell completely, all the way to the ground. And there was dust everywhere and it was just like everyone has been saying: It was just like out of the movies.\" Babineau said the rear of his pickup truck was dangling over the edge of a broken-off section of the bridge. He said several vehicles slid past him into the water. \"I stayed in my car for one or two seconds. I saw a couple cars fall,\" he said. \"So I stayed in my car until the cars quit falling for a second, then I got out real quick, ran in front of my truck -- because behind my truck was just a hole -- and I helped a woman off of the bridge with me. \"I just wanted off the bridge, and then I ran over to the school bus. I started grabbing kids and handing them down. It was just complete chaos.\" He said most of the children were crying or screaming. He and other rescuers set them on the ground and told them to run to the river bank, but a few needed to be carried because of their injuries.  See rescuers clamber over rubble \u00bb . Babineau said he had no rescue training. \"I just knew what I had to do at the moment.\" Melissa Hughes, 32, of Minneapolis, told The Associated Press that she was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her. \"You know that free-fall feeling? I felt that twice,\" Hughes said. A pickup landed on top of her car, but she was not hurt. \"I had no idea there was a vehicle on my car,\" she told AP. \"It's really very surreal.\" Babineau told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: \"On the way down, I thought I was dead. I literally thought I was dead. \"My truck was completely face down, pointed toward the ground, and my truck got ripped in half. It was folded in half, and I can't believe I'm alive.\"  See and hear eyewitness accounts \u00bb . Bernie Toivonen told CNN's \"American Morning\" that his vehicle was on a part of the bridge that ended up tilted at a 45-degree angle. \"I knew the deck was going down, there was no question about it, and I thought I was going to die,\" he said. After the bridge settled and his car remained upright, \"I just put in park, turned the key off and said, 'Oh, I'm alive,' \" he said.

The polyps were removed and sent to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for routine microscopic examination, spokesman Scott Stanzel said. Results are expected in two to three days. All were small, less than a centimeter [half an inch] in diameter, he said. Bush is in good humor, Stanzel said, and will resume his activities at Camp David. During the procedure Vice President Dick Cheney assumed presidential power. Bush reclaimed presidential power at 9:21 a.m. after about two hours. Doctors used \"monitored anesthesia care,\" Stanzel said, so the president was asleep, but not as deeply unconscious as with a true general anesthetic. He spoke to first lady Laura Bush -- who is in Midland, Texas, celebrating her mother's birthday -- before and after the procedure, Stanzel said. Afterward, the president played with his Scottish terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley, Stanzel said. He planned to have lunch at Camp David and have briefings with National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten, and planned to take a bicycle ride Saturday afternoon. Cheney, meanwhile, spent the morning at his home on Maryland's eastern shore, reading and playing with his dogs, Stanzel said. Nothing occurred that required him to take official action as president before Bush reclaimed presidential power. The procedure was supervised by Dr. Richard Tubb, Bush's physician, and conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, the White House said. Bush's last colonoscopy was in June 2002, and no abnormalities were found, White House spokesman Tony Snow said. The president's doctor had recommended a repeat procedure in about five years. A colonoscopy is the most sensitive test for colon cancer, rectal cancer and polyps, small clumps of cells that can become cancerous, according to the Mayo Clinic. Small polyps may be removed during the procedure. Snow said on Friday that Bush had polyps removed during colonoscopies before becoming president. Snow himself is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer that began in his colon and spread to his liver.  Watch Snow talk about Bush's procedure and his own colon cancer \u00bb . \"The president wants to encourage everybody to use surveillance,\" Snow said.

NFL star Michael Vick is set to appear in court Monday. A judge will have the final say on a plea deal. Earlier, Vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Virginia. \"Your admitted conduct was not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible. Your team, the NFL, and NFL fans have all been hurt by your actions,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a letter to Vick. Goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over. In papers filed Friday with a federal court in Virginia, Vick also admitted that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not fight well. Falcons owner Arthur Blank said Vick's admissions describe actions that are \"incomprehensible and unacceptable.\" The suspension makes \"a strong statement that conduct which tarnishes the good reputation of the NFL will not be tolerated,\" he said in a statement.  Watch what led to Vick's suspension \u00bb . Goodell said the Falcons could \"assert any claims or remedies\" to recover $22 million of Vick's signing bonus from the 10-year, $130 million contract he signed in 2004, according to The Associated Press. Vick said he would plead guilty to one count of \"Conspiracy to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of Unlawful Activities and to Sponsor a Dog in an Animal Fighting Venture\" in a plea agreement filed at U.S. District Court in Richmond, Virginia. The charge is punishable by up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, \"full restitution, a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release,\" the plea deal said. Federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines. \"The defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense,\" the plea agreement said. In an additional summary of facts, signed by Vick and filed with the agreement, Vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs, but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won. \"Most of the 'Bad Newz Kennels' operations and gambling monies were provided by Vick,\" the official summary of facts said. Gambling wins were generally split among co-conspirators Tony Taylor, Quanis Phillips and sometimes Purnell Peace, it continued. \"Vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights. Vick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by 'Bad Newz Kennels.' \" Vick also agreed that \"collective efforts\" by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs. Around April, Vick, Peace and Phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at Vick's property in Virginia, the statement said. \"Peace, Phillips and Vick agreed to the killing of approximately 6-8 dogs that did not perform well in 'testing' sessions at 1915 Moonlight Road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods, including hanging and drowning. \"Vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of Peace, Phillips and Vick,\" the summary said. Peace, 35, of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Phillips, 28, of Atlanta, Georgia; and Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Virginia, already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences. Vick, 27, is scheduled to appear Monday in court, where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge.  See a timeline of the case against Vick \u00bb . The judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement. The federal case against Vick focused on the interstate conspiracy, but Vick's admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges, according to CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. \"It sometimes happens -- not often -- that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior,\" Toobin said Friday. \"The risk for Vick is, if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea, the state of Virginia could say, 'Hey, look, you admitted violating Virginia state law as well. We're going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court.' \" In the plea deal, Vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary. Vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests. Vick agreed to \"make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated\" with the dogs that are being held by the government. \"Such costs may include, but are not limited to, all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case, including if necessary, the long-term care and/or the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals.\" Prosecutors, with the support of animal rights activists, have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs. But the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against Vick and his admitted co-conspirators. Judge Henry E. Hudson issued an order Thursday telling the U.S. Marshals Service to \"arrest and seize the defendant property, and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property.\" Both the judge's order and Vick's filing refer to \"approximately\" 53 pit bull dogs. After Vick's indictment last month, Goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the Falcons training camp, and the league is reviewing the case. Blank told the NFL Network on Monday he could not speculate on Vick's future as a Falcon, at least not until he had seen \"a statement of facts\" in the case.  E-mail to a friend .

Nearby, his parents talked about the new future and hope they have for their boy -- and the potential for recovery from his severe burns. Youssif holds his sister's hand Friday. He's wearing a facial mask often used to help burn victims. It's the best birthday present the Iraqi family could ever have imagined for their boy: Youssif turns 6 next Friday. \"I was so happy I didn't know what to do with myself,\" his mother, Zainab, told CNN, a broad smile across her face. \"I didn't think the reaction would be this big.\" His father said he was on the roof of his house when CNN called him with the news about the outpouring of support for his son. \"We just want to thank everyone who has come forward,\" he said. \"We knew there was kindness out there.\" Like his wife, he couldn't stop smiling. He talked about how he tried in vain to get help for his son in Baghdad, leaving \"no stone unturned\" on a mission to help his boy. There were many trips to the Ministry of Health. He says he even put in a request to Iraq's parliament for help. The family eventually told CNN their story -- that Youssif was grabbed by masked men outside their home on January 15, doused in gasoline and set on fire. Simply by coming forward, his parents put themselves in incredible danger. No one has been arrested or held accountable in Youssif's case.  Watch CNN's Arwa Damon describe 'truly phenomenal' outpouring \u00bb . Shortly after Youssif's story aired Wednesday, the Children's Burn Foundation -- a nonprofit organization based in Sherman Oaks, California, that provides support for burn victims locally, nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for Youssif and his family to come to the United States and to set up a fund for donations. You can make a donation at the foundation's site by clicking here. There's a drop-down menu under the \"general donation\" area that is marked \"Youssif's fund.\" The foundation says it will cover all medical costs -- from surgeries for Youssif to housing costs to any social rehabilitation that might be needed for him. Surgeries will be performed by Dr. Peter Grossman, a plastic surgeon with the affiliated Grossman Burn Center who is donating his services for Youssif's cause. Officials are still trying to get the appropriate visas for the family's travels. \"We are prepared to have them come here, set them up in a housing situation, provide support for them and begin treatment,\" said Barbara Friedman, executive director of the Children's Burn Foundation. \"We expect that the treatment will be from between six months to a year with many surgeries.\" She added, \"He will be getting the absolute best care that's available.\" Youssif's parents said they know it's going to be a lengthy and difficult process and that adjusting to their stay in America may not be easy. But none of that matters -- getting help for their boy is first and foremost. \"I will do anything for Youssif,\" his father said, pulling his son closer to him. \"Our child is everything.\" His mother tried to coax Youssif to talk to us on this day. But he didn't want to; his mother says he's shy outside of their home. The biggest obstacle now is getting the visas to leave, and the serious security risks they face every day and hour they remain in Iraq. But this family -- which saw the very worst in humanity on that January day -- has new hope in the world. That is partly due to the tens of thousands of CNN.com users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act. CNN Iraqi staff central to bringing this story together were also overwhelmed with the generosity coming from people outside of their border.

They have been driven to sell their bodies to put food on the table for their children -- for as little as $8 a day. Suha, 37, is a mother of three. She says her husband thinks she is cleaning houses when she leaves home. \"People shouldn't criticize women, or talk badly about them,\" says 37-year-old Suha as she adjusts the light colored scarf she wears these days to avoid extremists who insist women cover themselves. \"They all say we have lost our way, but they never ask why we had to take this path.\" A mother of three, she wears light makeup, a gold pendant of Iraq around her neck, and an unexpected air of elegance about her. \"I don't have money to take my kid to the doctor.

Karima, clad in all black, adds, \"My husband died of lung cancer nine months ago and left me with nothing.\" She has five children, ages 8 to 17. Her eldest son could work, but she's too afraid for his life to let him go into the streets, preferring to sacrifice herself than risk her child. She was solicited the first time when she was cleaning an office. \"They took advantage of me,\" she says softly. \"At first I rejected it, but then I realized I have to do it.\" Both Suha and Karima have clients that call them a couple times a week. Other women resort to trips to the market to find potential clients. Or they flag down vehicles. Prostitution is a choice more and more Iraqi women are making just to survive. \"It's increasing,\" Suha says. \"I found this 'thing' through my friend, and I have another friend in the same predicament as mine. Because of the circumstance, she is forced to do such things.\" Violence, increased cost of living, and lack of any sort of government aid leave women like these with few other options, according to humanitarian workers. \"At this point there is a population of women who have to sell their bodies in order to keep their children alive,\" says Yanar Mohammed, head and founder of the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq. \"It's a taboo that no one is speaking about.\" She adds, \"There is a huge population of women who were the victims of war who had to sell their bodies, their souls and they lost it all. It crushes us to see them, but we have to work on it and that's why we started our team of women activists.\" Her team pounds the streets of Baghdad looking for these victims often too humiliated to come forward. \"Most of the women that we find at hospitals [who] have tried to commit suicide\" have been involved in prostitution, said Basma Rahim, a member of Mohammed's team. The team's aim is to compile information on specific cases and present it to Iraq's political parties -- to have them, as Mohammed puts it, \"come tell us what [they] are ... going to do about this.\" Rahim tells the heartbreaking story of one woman they found who lives in a room with three of her children: \"She has sex while her three children are in the room, but she makes them stand in separate corners.\" According to Rahim and Mohammed, most of the women they encounter say they are driven to prostitution by a desperate desire for survival in the dangerously violent and unforgiving circumstances in Iraq. \"They took this path but they are not pleased,\" Rahim says. Karima says when she sees her children with food on the table, she is able to convince herself that it's worth it. \"Everything is for the children. They are the beauty in life and, without them, we cannot live.\" But she says, \"I would never allow my daughter to do this. I would rather marry her off at 13 than have her go through this.\" Karima's last happy memory is of her late husband, when they were a family and able to shoulder the hardships of life in today's Iraq together. Suha says as a young girl she dreamed of being a doctor, with her mom boasting about her potential in that career. Life couldn't have taken her further from that dream. \"It's not like we were born into this, nor was it ever in my blood,\" she says.

Tomas Medina Caracas, known popularly as \"El Negro Acacio,\" was a member of the high command of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia and, according to Colombian and U.S. officials, helped manage the group's extensive cocaine trafficking network. He had been in the cross-hairs of the U.S. Justice Department since 2002.

Niranjan Desai discovered the 20-year-old AT4 anti-tank rocket launcher tube, a one-time-use device, lying on her lawn Friday morning, police said. The launcher has been turned over to U.S. Army officials at the 754th Ordnance Company, an explosive ordnance disposal unit, at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, Army officials said. The launcher \"is no longer operable and not considered to be a hazard to public safety,\" police said, adding there was no indication the launcher had been fired recently. Army officials said they could not determine if the launcher had been fired, but indicated they should know once they find out where it came from. The nearest military base, Fort Dix, is more than 70 miles from Jersey City. The Joint Terrorism Task Force division of the FBI and Jersey City police are investigating the origin of the rocket launcher and the circumstance that led to its appearance on residential property. \"Al Qaeda doesn't leave a rocket launcher on the lawn of middle-aged ladies,\" said Paul Cruickshank of New York University Law School's Center on Law and Security. A neighbor, Joe Quinn, said the object lying on Desai's lawn looked military, was brown, had a handle and strap, and \"both ends were open, like you could shoot something with it.\" Quinn also said the device had a picture of a soldier on it and was 3 to 4 feet long. An Army official said the device is basically a shoulder-fired, direct-fire weapon used against ground targets -- a modern-day bazooka -- and it is not wire-guided. According to the Web site Globalsecurity.org, a loaded M136 AT4 anti-tank weapon has a 40-inch-long fiberglass-wrapped tube and weighs just 4 pounds.

President Bush pauses Tuesday during a news conference at the  North American Leaders summit in Canada. On Wednesday in Kansas City, Missouri, Bush will tell members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that \"then, as now, people argued that the real problem was America's presence and that if we would just withdraw, the killing would end,\" according to speech excerpts released Tuesday by the White House. \"Three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left,\" Bush will say. \"Whatever your position in that debate, one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens, whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like 'boat people,' 're-education camps' and 'killing fields,' \" the president will say. The president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today's terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility, citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam, according to the excerpts. \"Here at home, some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently,\" Bush will say. On Tuesday, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, \"President Bush's attempt to compare the war in Iraq to past military conflicts in East Asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two. Our nation was misled by the Bush Administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of Iraq under false pretenses, leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history. \"While the President continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in Iraq, paid for by the taxpayers, American lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the Iraqi government. It is time to change direction in Iraq, and Congress will again work to do so in the fall.\" The White House is billing the speech, along with another address next week to the American Legion, as an effort to \"provide broader context\" for the debate over the upcoming Iraq progress report by Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad. President Bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the American people -- to withhold judgment on his troop \"surge\" in Iraq until the report comes out in September.  Watch Bush criticize the Iraqi government \u00bb . It is being closely watched on Capitol Hill, particularly by Republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq might begin. Bush's speeches Wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the White House to try to reframe the debate over Iraq, as public support for the war continues to sag. A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of Americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the Iraq war, and 72 percent say that even if Petraeus reports progress, it won't change their opinion. The poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report; 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq. In addition to his analogy to Vietnam, Bush in Wednesday's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from Asia, including the U.S. defeat and occupation of Japan after World War II and the Korean War in the 1950s, according to the excerpts. \"In the aftermath of Japan's surrender, many thought it naive to help the Japanese transform themselves into a democracy. Then, as now, the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom,\" Bush will say. \"Today, in defiance of the critics, Japan ... stands as one of the world's great free societies.\" Speaking about the Korean War, Bush will note that at the time \"critics argued that the war was futile, that we never should have sent our troops in, or that America's intervention was divisive here at home.\" \"While it is true that the Korean War had its share of challenges, America never broke its word,\" Bush will say. \"Without America's intervention during the war, and our willingness to stick with the South Koreans after the war, millions of South Koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime.\" E-mail to a friend .", "85f55a3e0dd672857aaaaa80954934a57b7a2fbf": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- A chronology of bombings and attempted bomb attacks in the mainland UK since the 1970s: .

Efforts to reach them were suspended 10 days later when two rescuers and a federal mining official were killed, and six people were injured in a second collapse as they tried to tunnel horizontally toward the area where the men had been working. Murray said last week that the search effort would stop if no signs of life were found at the sixth hole. Under pressure from the families, however, he agreed to try one more time. Families wanted officials to drill a hole large enough to send down a rescue capsule. The effort to lower the robotic device down a seventh hole had been called \"a long shot\" by an official. MSHA's Stickler said that hole was drilled into the Crandall Canyon Mine on Thursday, but there were problems with a robotic camera that teams were trying to lower into it. Work resumed Friday, this time at the fourth hole, but the camera could only descend about 7 feet, he said. \"Basically, what it saw was really not that much. There was quite a bit of mud in there, water coming down the hole. It really couldn't go any farther than seven feet,\" he said of the latest try. In addition, the roof was sagging. \"The families asked many, many questions and we answered them all the best we could, basically coming to the conclusion that we had run out of options.\" Murray said last Saturday he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the Crandall Canyon mine. \"I will never come back to that evil mountain,\" he said.

Honey bees walk on a moveable comb hive at the Bee Research Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees -- up to 90 percent of colonies in some U.S. beekeeping operations -- imperiling the crops largely dependent upon bees for pollination, such as oranges, blueberries, apples and almonds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says honey bees are responsible for pollinating $15 billion worth of crops each year in the United States. More than 90 fruits and vegetables worldwide depend on them for pollination. Signs of colony collapse disorder were first reported in the United States in 2004, the same year American beekeepers started importing bees from Australia. The disorder is marked by hives left with a queen, a few newly hatched adults and plenty of food, but the worker bees responsible for pollination gone. The virus identified in the healthy Australian bees is  Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) -- named that because it was discovered by Hebrew University researchers. Although worker bees in colony collapse disorder vanish, bees infected with IAPV die close to the hive, after developing shivering wings and paralysis. For some reason, the Australian bees seem to be resistant to IAPV and do not come down with symptoms. Scientists used genetic analyses of bees collected over the past three years and found that IAPV was present in bees that had come from colony collapse disorder hives 96 percent of the time. But the study released Thursday on the Science Express Web site, operated by the journal Science, cautioned that collapse disorder is likely caused by several factors. \"This research give us a very good lead to follow, but we do not believe IAPV is acting alone,\" said Jeffery S. Pettis of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Bee Research Laboratory and a co-author of the study. \"Other stressors on the colony are likely involved.\" This could explain why bees in Australia may be resistant to colony collapse. \"There are no cases ... in Australia at all,\" entomologist Dave Britton of the Australian Museum told the Sydney Morning Herald last month. \"It is a Northern Hemisphere phenomenon.\" Bee ecology expert and University of Florida professor Jamie Ellis said earlier this year that genetic weakness bred into bees over time, pathogens spread by parasites and the effects of pesticides and pollutants might be other factors. Researchers also say varroa mites affect all hives on the U.S. mainland but are not found in Australia. University of Georgia bee researcher Keith S. Delaplane said Thursday the study offers a warning -- and hope. \"One nagging problem has been a general inability to treat or vaccinate bees against viruses of any kind,\" said Delaplane, who has been trying to breed bees resistant to the varroa mite. \"But in the case of IAPV, there is evidence that some bees carry genetic resistance to the disorder. This is yet one more argument for beekeepers to use honey bee stocks that are genetically disease- and pest-resistant.\" Bee researchers will now look for stresses that may combine to kill bees. \"The next step is to ascertain whether IAPV, alone or in concert with other factors, can induce CCD [colony collapse disorder] in healthy bees,\" said Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. Besides the Columbia and USDA researchers, others involved in the study released Thursday include researchers from Pennsylvania State University, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, the University of Arizona and 454 Life Sciences.

Simpson will be held without bail after his arrest on robbery and assault charges, police announced late Sunday. Police released this mug shot of O.J. Simpson after his arrest. Simpson is accused of having directed several other men in an alleged armed robbery of sports memorabilia in a room at a Las Vegas hotel room. Las Vegas authorities said they have no information leading them to believe Simpson was carrying a firearm during the alleged incident at the Palace Station Hotel and Casino. Police said Simpson and other men burst into the room and walked out with the memorabilia, including some that was unrelated to Simpson, police said. \"We don't believe that anyone was roughed up, but there were firearms involved,\" Lt. Clint Nichols told reporters. Nichols said the firearms were pointed at the victims. A reporter asked Nichols: Was \"O.J. was the boss in that room?\" Nichols responded, \"That is what we believe, yes.\"  Watch Simpson transferred Sunday in handcuffs \u00bb . The alleged victims were identified as Bruce Fromong, a sports memorabilia collector who described the incident as \"a home invasion-type robbery,\" and Alfred Beardsley, who has been quoted by celebrity Web site TMZ.com as saying that Simpson later apologized to him and told him he regretted the incident. Acting on a tip, police met over the weekend at McCarran International Airport with 46-year-old Walter Alexander, of Mesa, Arizona, who told them about the alleged robbery and validated the tipster's information, Capt. James Dillon told reporters. Alexander was arrested Saturday night on two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary with a deadly weapon. He was released on his own recognizance and returned to Mesa either Saturday night or early Sunday morning, Dillon said. In addition, investigators are seeking four other men they believe accompanied Simpson into the hotel room, Nichols said. Nichols said, \"There is a social relationship between the individuals that we identified and O.J. Simpson.\" Though Simpson is not accused of having brandished a gun himself, two firearms that police said were used were recovered early Sunday in one of three searches. Investigators would would not divulge where the weapons were found. Nichols dismissed an initial report that the men may have been off-duty police. \"There is no truth to that whatsoever,\" he said. \"That came as a result of some language that was used when the individuals burst into the room that led our victims to believe that they may have been police.\" Simpson, 60, has acknowledged taking some items that belonged to him, but he has denied that any weapons were involved. \"Whether the property belonged to Mr. Simpson or not is still in debate,\" Nichols said. \"We are still in the process of sorting that out.\" Nichols also said that some of the property taken had Simpson's signature. But \"there was some other property taken as well,\" he said. \"I believe there were some Joe Montana cleats and some signed baseballs and other stuff.\" The latest charges against Simpson mean he faces the prospect of another prosecution, more than a decade after the June 1994 stabbing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman. Simpson was acquitted of murder the following year. The trial riveted much of the United States. But in 1997, a jury found him liable for the deaths in a civil case brought by the Goldman family. Simpson was ordered to pay the families a total of $33.5 million for the deaths . Goldman had gone to Nicole Simpson's Los Angeles home to return a pair of glasses the day of the slayings. Goldman's sister, Kim Goldman, said she wasn't surprised by the robbery allegations, since Simpson \"thinks he can do no wrong.\" \"He's capable of stabbing people to death, so I think robbery is nothing surprising,\" she said. \"Normal, logical, civil-minded, law-abiding people don't storm a room with guns demanding stuff back.\" Fromong had testified on Simpson's behalf in the civil case, telling the court that prices for Simpson memorabilia had dropped substantially since the 1995 verdict. His testimony was part of the defense's contention that Simpson could not afford to pay the Goldmans. Simpson recently wrote a book originally titled \"If I Did It\" and had planned to publish it himself, but a public outcry led to the cancellation of his book deal.

Anthony Ogadje, 25, and nine other contestants had gone to Shere Hills Lake in Nigeria's hilly Plateau State to prepare for the \"Gulder Ultimate Search,\" which sets a variety of physical challenges for participants. A statement from Nigerian Breweries on Monday said Ogadje died suddenly and he was thought to have drowned. \"All attempts to revive him by the attendant medical team and the lifeguards, including his fellow contestants, failed,\" said Nigerian Breweries, which is majority-owned by the Dutch giant. Broadcasting had been due to start on Thursday. In the show, the weakest contestants are evicted one by one until a winner emerges. The prize money is a big attraction in a country where most people live in extreme poverty and benefit little from Nigeria's oil wealth. The winner was to get 5 million naira (about $39,000) in cash, a four-wheel drive jeep and another 500,000 naira (about $3,900) to buy clothes. The winner could also have expected to become an instant celebrity, attracting sponsorship deals. The Ultimate Search, which started in 2004, gets high ratings. E-mail to a friend .

Sources say the classified materials were taken from the East Tennessee Technology Park. Roy Lynn Oakley, 67, of Roane County, Tennessee, appeared in federal court in Knoxville on Thursday. Oakley was briefly detained for questioning in the case in January, when authorities first learned of the alleged plot to divulge the materials, government sources told CNN. He voluntarily surrendered Thursday at an FBI field office in Knoxville, the sources said. Oakley is a former employee of Bechtel Jacobs, the Department of Energy's prime environmental management contractor at the East Tennessee Technology Park, prosecutors said. The indictment states that Oakley, \"having possession of, access to and having been entrusted with sections of 'barriers' and associated hardware used for uranium enrichment through the process of gaseous diffusion ... having reason to believe that such data would be utilized to injure the United States and secure an advantage to a foreign nation, did communicate, transmit and disclose such data to another person.\" The transfer took place January 26, the indictment alleges. Oakley is also charged with converting the material and \"restricted data\" to his own use. He began doing so on about October 17, 2006, and continued through January, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them. Oakley's attorney, Herb Moncier, said outside court Thursday that Oakley's job was to break rods \"into little pieces\" and throw them away. Moncier said Oakley had a security clearance, but Moncier did not believe it was a high-level clearance. The government alleges that in January, Oakley attempted to sell the \"pieces of scrap\" to someone he thought was a French agent -- but in reality was an undercover FBI agent, Moncier said. He said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an \"appliance\" under the law. \"Mr. Oakley has cooperated fully for the last six months,\" said Moncier, who added that he had traveled to Washington for work on the case. Each count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. \"While none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization, the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the safeguards and put that technology in the wrong hands,\" Kenneth Wainstein, assistant attorney general for national security, said in the Justice Department statement. One government source said the materials involved are not the \"crown jewels,\" but they should not have been taken from the facility. A \"barrier\" is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process, according to nuclear energy officials, but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job. Sources told CNN that federal authorities have been following Oakley and investigating the case for at least six months, after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material. Oakley, described as a low-level employee, apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind, an official familiar with the case said. A government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of Oakley's alleged intentions six months ago, the FBI and Department of Energy launched a joint investigation. The FBI then developed a sting operation, government officials familiar with the case said, and authorities intervened before there could be any involvement of a foreign country. East Tennessee Technology Park is an area of the DOE's Oak Ridge reservation \"where we are currently decontaminating and decommissioning buildings that were last used in 1985,\" Gerald Boyd, manager of the DOE's Oak Ridge site office, said Thursday. \"When they were in use, now over 20 years ago, some of the buildings at ETTP housed facilities used for the enrichment of uranium.\" Boyd said the technology park and the reservation \"are protected by multiple layers of security systems and detection programs, both visible and unseen, meant to identify rogue employees attempting to abuse their access and position.\" In this case, a review of security procedures showed that the system worked and \"successfully identified the individual in question,\" he said.

Doctors in Pakistan have been arrested for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys. They are not so unusual: a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners with end-stage illnesses to poorer places like China, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Colombia and the Philippines to buy a new lease of life. Lee, a 53-year-old chief subway technician in Hong Kong, was diagnosed with liver cancer in January 2005 but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread. A friend told him about a transplant hospital in China's north eastern Tianjin city and he signed up for a place. That April, he paid 260,000 yuan ($34,380) for a transplant -- surgery that saved his life. \"The hospital has connections with a lot of prisons,\" Lee told Reuters. \"Mine came from an executed prisoner from Heilongjiang. I thank the donor deeply.\" The World Health Organization estimates that 21,000 liver transplants are carried out annually, but medical experts put annual worldwide demand at at least 90,000. Demand for kidneys also exceeds supply, and that has given rise to organ trafficking and a black market for rich people and \"transplant tourists\" who travel to poor countries to buy body parts from people with few other routes to a better living. A donor in South Africa receives $700 for a kidney compared with $30,000 in the United States. A lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on, or at least regulate, the trade. But even where the trade is banned, laws are often muddled or laced with loopholes, which are sometimes defended by vested interests. And the unregulated route is much less complicated for the recipient. Any transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor -- especially for liver transplants which involve removing part of the donor's liver. The complications can include bleeding, infection, even death. In the transplant trade, the recipient need not worry about, for example, exposing a living relative to that risk. \"It is cheaper and your next of kin is not taking the risk and you don't have to care for someone you don't know. Once you pay, it is discarded in a way, it is dispensable,\" said Luc Noel, a Geneva-based coordinator for Clinical Procedures at the World Health Organization. China recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners, saying it must first meet demand at home for 2 million organs a year. Only 20,000 transplants are carried out in China each year. Of these, 3,000 are liver transplants and 95 percent of them use livers from dead donors. China defended its use of organs from executed prisoners, saying consent was obtained from convicts or their families. A transplant operation using the liver of a dead donor costs around $33,000 in China. \"What is important is the transparency, it has to be open to scrutiny ... if China makes its current system open to scrutiny and very transparent, that would do good,\" said the WHO's Noel. In Asia, a cultural obsession with keeping the body of the deceased intact has stymied public organ donation programs. Excluding China, Asia has fewer than 200 livers donated by people ahead of their death each year, said Lo Chung-man, professor of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery at the University of Hong Kong. Pakistan, where trade in human organs is not illegal, is turning into a \"kidney bazaar\", said the chief executive of Pakistan's Kidney Foundation, Jaffar Naqvi. There are no confirmed figures for the number of foreigners coming to the country for new kidneys but Naqvi said there were 13 centers in Lahore alone which reported more than 2,000 transplants last year from bought kidneys. Patients, mostly from Europe, Saudi Arabia and India, pay about 500,000 rupees ($8,500) for a new kidney, he said. Donors are paid $300 to $1,000 and often get no medical care after the surgery. There is no consent in some cases. In May police arrested nine people, four of them doctors, for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys for transplant operations. In the pipeline is a draft law aimed at banning the trade, but a powerful lobby bent on preserving it is trying to ensure it allows kidney donations for a non-relative, with no payment. Such a clause allowing \"altruistic\" organ donations will ensure the trade continues with secret payment to donors, Naqvi said. Stories of people selling their organs, especially kidneys, are not uncommon in Egypt, where more than 30 percent of a population of more than 73 million people live below the poverty line. Karam, who asked to be identified only by his first name because organ trading is illegal, said it took him only 15 days to secure a kidney for his sister who was suffering from kidney failure. He said a doctor found him a man willing to sell his kidney for 30,000 Egyptian pounds ($5,300). \"The fees of the doctor were 5,000 pounds. Both his money and the fees of the hospital were deducted from the money the 'donor' received,\" said Karam. He said doctors usually help in finding people willing to sell their organs from their patients' lists. Abdel-Kader Hegazy, head of the disciplinary committee at the Doctors' Union, said Egyptian law lacks clear punishment for those involved in illegal transplants, making it easy for doctors to repeat the offence. \"The law says it is illegal to trade in organs but does not specify the punishment. We at the union suspended many doctors and closed their practices, but they have appealed before courts and won their licenses back,\" he told Reuters. \"It is an annoying and a regrettable situation. Well-known doctors and professors are doing this. They are rich people but they do it because they have no moral values.\" The union has been pushing for legislation to regulate organ transplants, with a draft bill including heavy fines and a prison sentence for those involved and a ban on transplants between people of different nationalities. But the draft law has been languishing in parliament for several years because of differences between doctors and senior Muslim religious leaders on whether Islam allows organ transplants in the case of clinical deaths. In Turkey, students, unemployed young men and struggling fathers post adverts on the Internet selling their kidneys, listing their drinking and smoking habits and blood type. These would-be donors say they have had enquiries from Germany, Israel and Turkey with asking prices going up to 50,000 lira ($38,760). Hakan, a 27-year-old security guard in Istanbul with two young children who also requested only his first name be published, told Reuters he received five or six offers from Turkey and Germany, offering 10,000-15,000 lira ($11,600), but he's holding out for 40,000 lira. \"Of course it's frightening but there's nothing else to be done,\" he said, adding he hadn't told his wife as he knew she would object. \"I'm doing it because of my family, if I was alone it wouldn't matter. I've got two children ... there's nothing else I can do for them.\" E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

Lindsay Lohan may still get work after her legal problems are settled, but the cost will be high. It is an important question, too, because whether companies insure Lohan's future movies may determine whether she will quickly fall off Hollywood's A-list. But Lohan fans have little to fear because no actor is uninsurable, say underwriting experts. While some producers may balk at conditions for hiring problematic stars, experts say that unless an actor is serving time in prison, even the most volatile can be covered -- albeit at a high cost. \"For a price, anything can be done, although an insurance carrier can make things so unpalatable that at times the makers of the film just won't be interested,\" said Ross Miller, partner with insurance brokerage D.R. Reiff & Associates Inc. Lohan's arrest this week in Los Angeles on suspicion of drunken driving and cocaine possession has left Hollywood wondering if the actress, who shot to fame as a child in Disney films like \"The Parent Trap,\" is too risky to cast in a film.  Timeline: Lindsay Lohan's troubles \u00bb . It remains to be seen whether her latest relapse and brush with the law will cost her a role in \"Poor Things,\" a film produced by and starring Oscar-winner Shirley MacLaine.  See a gallery of Lohan's films \u00bb . A statement was expected early next week on whether the movie, already delayed this spring due to an earlier rehab stint by Lohan, will proceed with or without her. Insurance experts say the industry has long dealt with similar situations, although they may seem more frequent with the recent heavy media scrutiny of Lohan and fellow troubled party girls Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. \"I don't think it (a problematic artist) is any more of an issue,\" said Wendy Diaz, entertainment underwriting director at Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., the leading film underwriter. \"It's pretty standard year to year.\" But Diaz did say the terms for covering Lohan would likely be \"serious at this point.\" She said Fireman's Fund, in such a case, would likely put in higher deductibles, or ask the star to put their salary into escrow to pay for any losses if production was disrupted. Last July, a producer on Lohan's last film, \"Georgia Rule,\" scolded her publicly for repeatedly showing up late on the set, costing the movie's makers hundreds of thousands of dollars. Brian Kingman, a managing director with entertainment insurance broker Aon/Albert G. Ruben said covering situations like Lohan's required a lot of calculation and risk management. Insurance rates for errant actors can range anywhere from 1 percent to 3 percent of a movie's production budget, which can range from $5 million to $100 million or more, he said. \"Filmmakers fall in love with certain actors for certain roles and my job is to find risk-takers to take on the risk,\" Kingman said. He said actors were always required to undergo a medical exam before getting insurance. In certain circumstances, drug screening is conducted and actors are required to provide blood and urine samples. In cases of known drug abuse, \"minders\" are sometimes required on set to keep an eye on the actor. Kingman said he had even helped craft policies for actors in the event they risked the possibility of incarceration. \"I have been successful in finding and creating incarceration coverage for certain actors on probation which can be revoked if they break certain rules,\" he said, citing the case of Robert Downey Jr., another high-profile star with a history of legal, drug and alcohol problems.

Youssif has always been a huge Spider-Man fan. Meeting him was \"my favorite thing,\" he said. Spider-Man was right smack dab in front of him, riding a four-wheeler amid a convoy of other superheroes. The legendary climber of buildings and fighter of evil dismounted, walked over to Youssif and introduced himself. Spidey then gave the boy from a far-away land a gentle hug, embracing him in his iconic blue and red tights. He showed Youssif a few tricks, like how to shoot a web from his wrist. Only this time, no web was spun. \"All right Youssif!\" Spider-Man said after the boy mimicked his wrist movement. Other superheroes crowded around to get a closer look. Even the Green Goblin stopped his villainous ways to tell the boy hi. Youssif remained unfazed. He didn't take a liking to Spider-Man's nemesis. Spidey was just too cool. \"It was my favorite thing,\" the boy said later. \"I want to see him again.\" He then felt compelled to add: \"I know it's not the real Spider-Man.\" This was the day of dreams when the boy's nightmares were, at least temporarily, forgotten. He met SpongeBob, Lassie and a 3-year-old orangutan named Archie. The hairy, brownish-red primate took to the boy, grabbing his hand and holding it. Even when Youssif pulled away, Archie would inch his hand back toward the boy's and then snatch it.  See Youssif enjoy being a boy again \u00bb . The boy giggled inside a play area where sponge-like balls shot out of toy guns. It was a far different artillery than what he was used to seeing in central Baghdad, as recently as a week ago.

Fire and smoke filled the air, debris cascaded down and a big rig skidded toward the vehicle. The boy and his family survived the pretend earthquake unscathed. \"Even I was scared,\" the dad said. \"Well, I wasn't,\" Youssif replied. The father and mother grinned from ear to ear throughout the day. Youssif pushed his 14-month-old sister, Ayaa, in a stroller. \"Did you even need to ask us if we were interested in coming here?\" Youssif's father said in amazement. \"Other than my wedding day, this is the happiest day of my life,\" he said. Just a day earlier, the mother and father talked about their journey out of Iraq and to the United States. They also discussed that day nine months ago when masked men grabbed their son outside the family home, doused him in gas and set him on fire. His mother heard her boy screaming from inside. The father sought help for his boy across Baghdad, but no one listened. He remembers his son's two months of hospitalization. The doctors didn't use anesthetics. He could hear his boy's piercing screams from the other side of the hospital.  Watch Youssif meet his doctor and play with his little sister \u00bb . The father knew that speaking to CNN would put his family's lives in jeopardy. The possibility of being killed was better than seeing his son suffer, he said. \"Anything for Youssif,\" he said. \"We had to do it.\" They described a life of utter chaos in Baghdad. Neighbors had recently given birth to a baby girl. Shortly afterward, the father was kidnapped and killed. Then, there was the time when some girls wore tanktops and jeans. They were snatched off the street by gunmen. The stories can be even more gruesome. The couple said they had heard reports that a young girl was kidnapped and beheaded --and her killers sewed a dog's head on the corpse and delivered it to her family's doorstep. \"These are just some of the stories,\" said Youssif's mother, Zainab. Under Saddam Hussein, there was more security and stability, they said. There was running water and electricity most of the time. But still life was tough under the dictator, like the time when Zainab's uncle disappeared and was never heard from again after he read a \"religious book,\" she said. Sitting in the parking lot of a Target in suburban Los Angeles, Youssif's father watched as husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, parents and their children, came and went. Some held hands. Others smiled and laughed. \"Iraq finished,\" he said in what few English words he knows. He elaborated in Arabic: His homeland won't be enjoying such freedoms anytime soon. It's just not possible. Too much violence. Too many killings. His two children have only seen war. But this week, the family has seen a much different side of America -- an outpouring of generosity and a peaceful nation at home. \"It's been a dream,\" the father said. He used to do a lot of volunteer work back in Baghdad. \"Maybe that's why I'm being helped now,\" the father said. At Universal Studios, he looked out across the valley below.

Here is his speech in full: . William and I can separate life into two parts. There were those years when we were blessed with the physical presence beside us of both our mother and father. Princes Harry and William greet guests at a thanksgiving service in memory of their mother. And then there are the 10 years since our mother's death. When she was alive, we completely took for granted her unrivaled love of life, laughter, fun and folly. She was our guardian, friend and protector. She never once allowed her unfaltering love for us to go unspoken or undemonstrated. She will always be remembered for her amazing public work. But behind the media glare, to us, just two loving children, she was quite simply the best mother in the world. We would say that, wouldn't we. But we miss her. She kissed us last thing at night. Her beaming smile greeted us from school. She laughed hysterically and uncontrollably when sharing something silly she might have said or done that day. She encouraged us when we were nervous or unsure. She -- like our father -- was determined to provide us with a stable and secure childhood. To lose a parent so suddenly at such a young age, as others have experienced, is indescribably shocking and sad. It was an event which changed our lives forever, as it must have done for everyone who lost someone that night. But what is far more important to us now, and into the future, is that we remember our mother as she would have wished to be remembered as she was: fun-loving, generous, down-to-earth, entirely genuine. We both think of her every day. We speak about her and laugh together at all the memories. Put simply, she made us, and so many other people, happy. May this be the way that she is remembered. Prince William's reading from St Paul's letter to the Ephesians: . I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name. I pray that, according to the riches of His glory, He may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through His Spirit, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, as you are being rooted and grounded in love. I pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. Now to Him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine, to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, for ever and ever. Amen. Thanks be to God. The Bishop of London's speech: . \"Who's cheating?\" The scene is an old people's home. Two residents are playing Beggar My Neighbor. Enter the Princess. The question from the royal visitor is unexpected but everyone laughs. Afterwards they comment on her large eyes and what life she brought into the room. One tiny incident, characteristic of countless other occasions in the Princess's public life in which she found the right word or the right gesture to bring cheer and comfort. Everyone here will have their own memories. I remember meeting Princess Diana for the very first time early in 1981 to discuss details of the wedding service in St Paul's. Even Archbishop's Chaplains have their share of proper diffidence and I was nervous entering the presence. It must have been a bewildering time for the Princess as well, but even then, at the age of 20, her capacity for empathy and her very strong intuitive power ensured that any tension soon evaporated. Prince Harry has spoken movingly and justly, as few others have the right to do, about the Princess as a mother. I want to dwell for a moment on her public work, its cost and its meaning. After her marriage, the Princess joined her natural gifts of beauty, empathy and powerful intuition with that extraordinary charge which association with the Royal Family generates. Led by our Queen and other members of the Royal Family, our constitution has developed in response to the challenges of the past century. There is a properly political sphere in which the monarch may counsel but doesn't intrude, but there is another sphere, vital to any sense of national unity and creativity, a sphere in which communities must be celebrated, common values articulated and the transcendent source of those values honored. We tend to be suspicious of public figures who wrap themselves in divinity and claim that their will is God's will, but if no-one can articulate in an un-ignorable way in the public realm the creative energy of the love that we see in Christ, the human face of God, then we shall find ourselves inhabiting a maimed and diminished society. And at a time when people are suspicious of rhetoric, the monarchy communicates by symbol and by simple speech, and the Princess brought her own gifts to this work. She was still only 26 in 1987 when she shook the hand of a patient at the opening of the Middlesex Hospital's Aids ward. It was the first in the UK and it is very hard now to credit the degree of fear and prejudice which surrounded Aids in the '80s. Those familiar with the field have no doubt that the Princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo in a gesture which was not choreographed but sprung from a deep identification with those who were vulnerable and on the margin. And she had a similar impact in the USA. An editorial in the New York Times in 1989 admitted ruefully that it had taken a foreign, and even a royal, dignitary to draw attention to a major public health concern in the US. Her work in the very last year of her life for the victims of landmines also caught the popular imagination internationally and certainly accelerated the adoption of the Ottawa Convention, banning the use of a weapon which disproportionately kills and maims women and children. She proved the eloquence of embrace and of touch which, of course, have been used by royal healers throughout the centuries. And as she said, in her words, \"the biggest disease today is not leprosy or TB but the feeling of being unwanted\". She sought out places of suffering, because they are so very often places of truth where the masks have been removed, and she was not afraid to be with the dying and to comfort them in an unsentimental way. Bill Deedes accompanied her on some of her visits. His response to the cynics was typically robust. He said: \"She was one who sought above all to help vulnerable people in society and who did it so well. She was good at this because she herself was vulnerable. She knew the feeling. She didn't set out to be a saint.\" The role brought great power but, like any member of the Royal Family, she also experienced the weight of expectation and the intensity of the scrutiny. Honoring but managing the role and not allowing it to take over one's personal humanity is a desperately difficult task. As we have heard from Prince Harry, his mother Diana did all that she could to prepare her sons for the work which lies ahead. She confessed to receiving a very great deal from some of those whose lives she touched. She said of John, a young Greek suffering from cystic fibrosis: \"He showed no sign of anger, no trace of bitterness but touched us all with an aura of optimism and hope for the future such that I have never before encountered.\" The love of Christ described in the lesson read by Prince William contains the essence of the spiritual life. Princess Diana recognized this quality of life in many of those, like John, whose lives she touched. It was a mystery which resonated deeply with her and for which she reached out. And the mystery is this - the more you go beyond yourself, the more you will become your true self; the more you lose yourself in loving and serving others, the more you will find yourself; the more you keep company with those who suffer, the more you will be healed. This is the knowledge which passes all understanding. This is certain and has been proved experimentally in the life of all the saints. It's easy to lose the real person in the image, to insist that all is darkness or all is light. Still, 10 years after her tragic death, there are regular reports of \"fury\" at this or that incident, and the Princess's memory is used for scoring points. Let it end here. Let this service mark the point at which we let her rest in peace and dwell on her memory with thanksgiving and compassion. Let us also, echoing the words of Prince Harry, look to the future and pray, in the words of St Paul, for all those who serve our country as members of the Royal Family and most especially for the sons who were so precious to her: . \"I pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power with all the saints to grasp what is the breadth and length and depth and height of the love of Christ and to know this love which surpasses knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of God.\" Amen.

But then Kouchner was never expected to be a soft-soaper on the diplomatic scene. French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner has a reputation for challenging convention and authority. A surprise appointment from the Socialist ranks to Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative government, the founder of Medicins Sans Frontiers has always challenged convention and authority. The former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali once called Kouchner 'an unguided missile' and the man himself has been known to declare: \"To change the law you sometimes have to break the law\". He was in his youth one of the leaders of the students revolt in France in May 1968. Kouchner is a humanitarian as well as a patriot, with a strong commitment to human rights. Unusually for a man of the Left, he supported the US-led intervention in Iraq (while criticizing the aftermath). But he did so on the grounds of Saddam Hussein's denial of human rights, not his possible possession of weapons of mass destruction. His and President Sarkozy's concern for human rights lies behind their eagerness to join Gordon Brown's Britain in a new push for action in Darfur. Bernard Kouchner did not come to his position with any of former President Chirac's instinctive distrust of the United States. Washington, which has been critical of some European states for their weakness in confronting Teheran, will have been delighted by his 'get serious' warning to Teheran. But the plain-speaking Kouchner is unlikely to be deterred by fears of upsetting the White House when he has criticisms to make of US policy. How much should be made of his words on Iran remains unclear at this stage. They were scarcely on the same scale as President Chirac's threat when he was still in office to retaliate with nuclear strikes against any state found to be responsible for a large-scale terrorist attack on France. But they are all of a piece with France's new high-profile style under the presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy. Mr Kouchner, for example, became the first French Foreign Minister to visit Iraq since 1988, insisting that there could only be a political solution to the country's problems, not a military one, and offering France's services as a mediator and 'honest broker' between Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. On Iran he is, in a way, merely echoing the words of his President who declared in a speech last month that a nuclear-armed Iran would be 'unacceptable' and describing the stand-off over its nuclear program as 'undoubtedly the most serious crisis before us today'. Certainly Mr Kouchner is making clear that France no longer takes the view once expressed by President Chirac that a nuclear-armed Iran might be inevitable . In continuing to ratchet up the rhetoric over that threat and to underline the West's resolution on Iran's nuclear enrichment program Mr Kouchner is supplementing his president's warnings. Neither is saying that military intervention against Iran is imminent or inevitable. Neither has yet confirmed that France would be part of any such military action. But both are stressing the risks which are piling up as a result of Teheran's brinkmanship. Perhaps the strongest lesson though from Mr Kouchner's intervention is his underlining that the new administration in France is not a knee-jerk anti-American one -- and that France is in the business of reclaiming a role at the top diplomatic tables.

Written for: Some girl probably not named Elise. In fact, as far as most historians can tell, Beethoven didn't even know an Elise. Instead, the song was originally titled \"Bagatelle in A minor\" based on some handwritten notation a Beethoven researcher claimed to have seen on a now-lost copy of the sheet music. Further complicating things, Beethoven had hideous handwriting -- to the point that some scholars speculate the song was actually written \"for Therese,\" as in Therese Malfatti, one of several women who turned down a marriage proposal from the notoriously lovesick maestro. 2. \"Philadelphia Freedom\" Written by: Elton John & Bernie Taupin . Written for: Billie Jean King, as a thank-you for a tracksuit she gave Elton. And what a tracksuit it must have been! The 1975 song remains one of the most popular disco hits ever, leaving thousands of Hustle enthusiasts wondering just what Billie Jean King had to do with Philadelphia, anyway. Turns out, the song was a reference to King's pro tennis team, The Philadelphia Freedoms. Prior to 1968, tennis players were all considered \"amateurs\" and weren't eligible to receive prize money. So, if you didn't have the wealth to support yourself, you couldn't play. Billie Jean King fought against those constraints, ultimately founding Professional World Team Tennis in 1974 and turning tennis into a paid league sport. 3. \"Lola\" Written by: The Kinks' Ray Davies . Written for: A transvestite. But the question is, which one? According to Rolling Stone, \"Lola\" was inspired by Candy Darling, a member of Andy Warhol's entourage, whom Ray Davies briefly (and cluelessly) dated. If that's the case, then \"Lola\" is just another notch on Darling's song belt -- she's also referred to in Lou Reed's \"Walk on the Wild Side.\" (\"Candy came from out on the Island/ In the backroom she was everybody's darlin'.\") But, in the Kinks' official biography, Davies tells a different story. He says \"Lola\" was written after the band's manager spent a very drunken night dancing with a woman whose five o'clock shadow was apparently obvious to everyone but him. 4. \"867-5309/Jenny\" Written by: Jim Keller (of Tommy Tutone) and Alex Call . Written for: Unknown, as the songwriters apparently make up a different story about its inspiration every time they're asked. While the woman continues to remain a mystery, however, the phone number is all too real. In fact, it's been wreaking havoc ever since 1982 and the passage of time hasn't quelled of the number of crank calls. In 1999, Brown University freshman roommates Nina Clemente and Jahanaz Mirza found that out the hard way, when the school adopted an 867 exchange number for its on-campus phone system. Immediately, the girls' innocuous Room No. 5309 became a magnet for every drunk college kid with a 1980s fetish. Other unfortunate phone customers have fought back with creative and profitable solutions, like the holder of 212-867-5309, who put his phone number up for auction on eBay in 2004. Bids approached $100,000 before eBay pulled the item at the request of Verizon, the number's actual owner. 5. \"Oh, Carol\" Written by: Neil Sedaka . Written for: Carole King, naturally. Sedaka and King actually dated briefly in high school -- a romance Sedaka was able to successfully milk with \"Oh, Carol,\" a then top-10 (if now somewhat forgettable) 1959 pop song. However, the real success of \"Oh, Carol\" came a few months later, when it inspired King to write a rebuttal entitled \"Oh, Neil.\" At the time, King and her husband, Gerry Goffin, were fledgling songwriters in need of a hit tune. \"Oh, Neil\" wasn't that, but it did pay off. After Sedaka gave a tape of the song to his boss, King and Goffin landed jobs at the legendary Brill Building pop music factory, where the duo went on to write chart-toppers like \"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\" and \"The Loco-Motion.\" 6. \"It Ain't Me, Babe\" Written by: Bob Dylan . Written for: Joan Baez, though it clearly wasn't the nicest gift Dylan could have given her. The two met in 1961, when Baez was an up-and-coming folk singer and Dylan was a nobody from Minnesota. Desperate to make his break in the music biz, Dylan worked like crazy to get Baez's attention. He eventually ended up going on tour with her, which is how he first became famous, and also how the two began dating. For a while, they seemed like the golden couple, but things soon went downhill. During a European concert tour together in early 1965, they had a huge fight and parted ways. That May, Dylan was holed up in a hotel after being hospitalized with a virus, and Baez, hoping to remain friends, decided to bring him flowers. Sadly, that's how she found out that her ex was already dating someone else. That someone else was Sara Lownds, whom Dylan married a mere six months later. 7. \"Our House\" Written by: Graham Nash (of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young) Written for: Joni Mitchell. In December 1968, Nash and Mitchell moved into a cozy little house in the Laurel Canyon section of Los Angeles. Though commonly left out of the hippy pantheon, Laurel Canyon was sort of a commune-home away from commune-home for San Francisco society -- not just CSN&Y, but also Jim Morrison, the Eagles, Frank Zappa, and more. \"Our House\" was directly inspired by a lazy Sunday in the Nash/Mitchell household. The couple went out to brunch, hit an antiques store, and then returned to find the house just a bit chilly, at which point Nash literally \"lit a fire,\" while Mitchell \"placed the flowers in the vase that she bought that day.\" No, really. The whole tableau seemed so ridiculously domestic to Nash that he immediately sat down and spent the rest of the day writing about it.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV advertising so far among presidential contenders. The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $3 billion, according to TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group, CNN's consultant on political television advertising. This is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $1.7 billion. In 2006, $2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy TV commercials. Just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money, said Evan Tracey, CMAG's chief operating officer. The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates, who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters.  See how spending breaks down for this year \u00bb . And interest groups have spent $6.2 million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures. On the national level, the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $270 million in the first nine months of this year. Subjects ranged from the Iraq war to telecommunications reform. Television ads on health care alone total $60 million. CMAG estimates more than $3 million of the $270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008. Tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups \"pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode.\" \"What we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries, and through the general election, is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates,\" he said. With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, CMAG predicts that more than $800 million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House. Up to now, the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on February 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads all candidates in TV spending, having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $8.6 million. This is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle.  Watch how Romney is way ahead in ad spending \u00bb . In contrast, one of Romney's chief rivals for the GOP nomination, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has spent nothing on television ads, but Giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys. Giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition, while Romney does not. In the race for the Democratic nomination, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama has spent more than $2.3 million on television commercials, while New York Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent $1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has probably benefited the most in the Democratic contest from the $2 million he has invested in his television commercials. Richardson's humorous TV ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker, diplomat and executive, and positioned him as a solid second-tier candidate. Romney used his $8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to Republican voters. These voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal Massachusetts. Romney is leading polls in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Further evidence of how Romney's television commercials have helped is in South Carolina. An American Research Group poll of South Carolina Republicans in August showed Romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters. A month later, and with $350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll, Romney was up 17 percentage points. Romney's latest ad began airing Friday in Iowa, and in it he vows to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, to boost the military by 100,000 people, to strengthen U.S. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the U.S. from al Qaeda. All of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the Iowa caucuses. While only a handful of Democratic candidates and Romney have used the airwaves until now, Tracey said he expects this to change. \"Before the end of October, I suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air,\" Tracey said. \"As we get closer to primary day, the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last, best shot.\" In the fight for Congress, CMAG predicts that as much as $639 million could be spent on television advertising. Democrats control the House and Senate. Tracey noted that CMAG's 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former Florida Rep. Mark Foley's House page scandal or the September 11 terrorist attacks. \"Politics is completely beholden to events,\" he said. \"Events will ultimately determine how much is spent, where and when.\" What television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months? \"Chances are, just as what happened in 2006, voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads,\" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. \"The sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance. After a while, the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise.\" E-mail to a friend .", "ee0ba7928d8987f2cb21c9a2012a76730f77de45": "PHUKET, Thailand (CNN) -- Relatives of the 89 people killed in Sunday's plane crash in Phuket continued to arrive in the Thai resort town on Tuesday to try to identify their loved ones' remains. A Buddhist monk blesses the wreckage of One-Two-Go airline's MD-82 jet at Phuket airport on Tuesday. Most of those killed were foreign nationals, and about 36 of the bodies still have yet to be identified, according to Thailand's state-run Thai News Agency (TNA). All of the unidentified victims were foreign nationals, it reported. The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok said that five Americans were among those killed when the One-Two-Go jet crashed in bad weather as it landed at Phuket's airport on Sunday. U.S. officials had previously confirmed that four Americans died in the crash, and one survived. Eight British nationals are believed to have died, according to Foreign Secretary David Miliband. He said three were still in hospital, with one in a critical condition. Thailand's Public Health Minister Mongkol Na Songkhla said that of the 41 survivors who remain hospitalized, 38 were in stable condition and three in critical condition, according to TNA. Flight 269 was carrying 123 passengers and seven crew members when it left Bangkok for Phuket on Sunday afternoon. Nationalities of the survivors include British, American, Swedish, Iranian, Austrian, Australian, Thai, German, Irish, Italian, Israeli and Dutch, authorities said. Watch a survivor recall the fiery horror \u00bb . One man who arrived in Phuket on Tuesday from Paris described a frustrating process of trying to communicate with Thai officials in his effort to locate the remains of his brother. For some families, DNA testing may be the only way to positively identify their relatives. Meanwhile, Buddhist, Christian and Muslim leaders gathered outside Phuket's airport on Tuesday to remember those killed. The investigation into what caused the crash continues, but the strong winds and rain are a suspected factor. U.S. officials are aiding in the investigation because the aircraft -- a Boeing MD-82 -- was manufactured in the United States. One air traffic controller at Phuket airport said pilots were warned of possible wind shear, which is dramatic changes in wind speed and direction. Airport officials said that the wind at the time of the crash was 17 kilometers an hour (11 miles an hour) with stronger gusts, but no planes were delayed or diverted because of the weather conditions. The decision to land was the pilot's alone, according to Phuket's airport manager. \"Air traffic control would give weather information to pilot and warning information but the final decision is dependent on the pilot,\" Pornchai Eua-Aree said. One-Two-Go officials would not speculate on what may have happened, saying they will wait for the findings of the investigation. But they did say their aircraft were regularly checked and maintained, and denied some media reports that questioned whether the discount airline employed more inexperienced pilots for lower salaries. One-Two-Go is one of about 40 low-cost airlines operating in Asia, and the industry will be watching closely for the results of the investigation into the crash. E-mail to a friend .

Michael Moore and CNN's Sanjay Gupta argued Tuesday about Gupta's report on Moore's film \"Sicko\" Moore criticized a report Gupta did on CNN Monday on \"Sicko.\" \"He said the facts were fudged,\" Moore said, referring to Gupta, on CNN's \"Larry King Live.\" \"That's a lie. None of the facts are fudged.\" Moore and Gupta shouted and argued over data Gupta used and data Moore used. Moore said his staffers backed up the film's facts to Gupta before the report aired and that Gupta aired it knowing his facts were wrong. Gupta disputed that.  Watch Moore, Gupta make their points \u00bb . \"We try and look for some of the best sources we can possibly find,\" he said. \"Michael has a lot of different numbers. ... You're sort of cherry-picking data from different reports.\" Both agreed, however, on the basic premise of \"Sicko\": Problems abound in America's health-care system and need to be fixed. \"I thought it was a good movie, and I wanted to say that,\" Gupta said. \"I think it strikes at the irrefutable fact -- it's broken. We get it.\" He praised Moore for raising awareness of the issue. However, Gupta said he was concerned that the movie -- which notes that other developed nations such as France and Canada have universal health care --suggests that health care in those countries is free. While patients may not pay for services at the doctor's office, they do pay high taxes to fund such a system, something Gupta said he was concerned that \"Sicko\" audiences might not realize. Moore responded by saying Americans pay more in copays, deductibles and insurance premiums. \"We [America] have a system built on profit,\" the moviemaker said. He asked Gupta if the current system, which requires him to receive approval from an insurance company before performing some procedures, is cumbersome to him. \"It's a shameful system, especially when I'm dealing with some of my patients,\" Gupta said. But he questioned Moore's apparent solution -- putting health care in the hands of the Bush administration, which Moore fiercely criticized in the past, particularly in his film \"Fahrenheit 9/11.\" \"The government actually used to do things right,\" Moore said in response. \"The problem is who we put in power.\" Moore has adamantly opposed the war in Iraq and said the government should reprioritize -- a position he took many years before skepticism of the war's success abounded in Washington. \"I am sorry we've taken so much time trying to correct [Gupta's] facts here tonight instead of talking about the real issue\" -- the ailing health care system, Moore said.

A KC-135 tanker lands at Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey in 2003. Turkey, a longtime U.S. ally and NATO partner, was incensed by the resolution calling the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks genocide and threatened to block access to Incirlik Air Base after the resolution passed a House committee vote. The base, in southern Turkey near Syria, is a major resupply center for U.S. operations in Iraq and elsewhere in the Mideast and Asia. The Pentagon is preparing to set up new supply routes for troops in Iraq if Turkey cuts off U.S. access to the strategically important Incirlik, military officials said Tuesday. Ankara acknowledges the killings of Armenians during World War I but vehemently objects to the \"genocide\" label. The House Foreign Affairs Committee last week adopted the nonbinding resolution. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would bring the measure to a vote of the full House sometime next month. But the Bush administration urged Congress to drop the issue, and some leading Democrats urged Pelosi not to bring it to the floor. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer signaled Tuesday that the vote might be put off. \"I said I thought we would bring this up prior to us leaving here,\" said Hoyer of Maryland. \"I have not changed on that, although I would be less than candid to say that there are a number of people who are revisiting their own positions. We will have to determine where everybody is.\" Democratic Rep. Ike Skelton, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, announced his opposition to the resolution last week. And Democratic Reps. Alcee Hastings of Florida and John Tanner of Tennessee, both members of the U.S. House delegation to NATO, urged Pelosi to reconsider in a letter released Tuesday. \"More than half of the cargo flown into Iraq and Afghanistan comes through Incirlik Air Base, and this base would be a key component of any plans for redeployment of our troops in the future,\" they wrote. Lt. Gen. Carter Ham, the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Pentagon planners are looking at \"a broad range of options\" to keep food, fuel and ammunition flowing to U.S. troops in Iraq if Turkey blocks Incirlik. \"We're confident that we'll find ways to do that,\" Ham told reporters at the Pentagon. \"There's likely to be some increased cost and some other implications for that, and obviously we'd prefer to maintain the access that we have.\" Defense Secretary Robert Gates echoed lawmakers' concerns last week. \"About 70 percent of all air cargo going into Iraq goes through Turkey. ... About a third of the fuel that they consume goes through Turkey or comes from Turkey,\" Gates said. He also said that 95 percent of the Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protective vehicles, or MRAPs, being deployed in Iraq are flown through Turkey. The vehicles are built to withstand roadside bombs.  See Incirlik's key location \u00bb . The U.S. military issued a \"warning order\" a few days ago to ensure that alternative air crews, planes, fuel and routes are lined up if Turkey stops or restricts U.S. access to Incirlik, a source said. Jordan and Kuwait are among the alternatives the United States is considering. Some fear pursuit of the resolution would also embolden the Turks to attack Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq which could further complicate Iraqi stability, U.S. officials said. Incirlik offers 10,000- and 9,000-foot runways and 57 hardened aircraft shelters, according Globalsecurity.org, a source of background information about military issues. Globalsecurity said Incirlik has become a hub for cargo shipments to Iraq, taking over for Rhein-Main Air Base in Germany because it is closer to Iraq, reducing the strain on troops and aircraft.

Row after row of headstones stand as the deadly reminder of the tragedy the city went through as insurgents battled for control of the city. Mohammed stops at his cousin's grave. \"I feel an ache when I think of her. Every time I remember her, I cry,\" he told CNN at a visit to the grave a few months ago.

Pratibha Patil, the ruling coalition's 72-year-old nominee for the mainly ceremonial post, easily beat opposition-backed challenger and vice president, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, in a vote by the national parliament and state politicians. \"This a victory of the people,\" Patil told reporters after official results were announced Saturday. \"I am grateful to the people of India and the men and women of India and this is a victory for the principles which our Indian people uphold.\" Patil won about two thirds of the electoral college votes. There had never been any doubt she would win, given support from the ruling coalition. The governor of the northwestern desert state of Rajasthan, she emerged on the national stage when the Congress-led coalition and its communist allies failed to agree on a joint candidate. \"This is a very special moment for us women, and men of course, in our country because for the first time we have a woman being elected president of India,\" Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi, India's most powerful politician, said. Supporters hoped Patil's candidacy would help bring issues that plague women in India, like dowry-related violence, into the public spotlight. A woman is murdered, raped or abused every three minutes on average in India. Her presidency also reflects the growing power of some women in India, where an increasing number are taking part in the workforce and in schools and hold senior positions in corporations. After the results, Patil supporters took to the streets, singing and dancing as others lit fire crackers and beat large brass drums. India has had a number of female icons in the past -- most famously Sonia Gandhi's mother-in-law, Indira, who was one of the world's first female prime ministers in 1966. But hope Patil's presidency would spark only positive talk about women's influence in India evaporated when it emerged the bank for women she helped established was closed in 2003 because of bad debts and amid accusations of financial irregularities. The employees' union has taken Patil and others to court, claiming loans meant for poor women were instead given to her brother and other relatives and not returned. She was also accused of trying to shield her brother in a murder inquiry. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has dismissed accusations against her as \"mud-slinging\", said on Saturday her victory was \"a vote against the politics of divisiveness\". \"All the allegations against me are motivated and have already been answered,\" Patil said in a statement last week. Her campaign was marked by other mishaps as well. She managed to offend many minority Muslims, and anger some historians, by saying Indian women first veiled their heads as protection against 16th century Muslim invaders. Then she dismayed modern India by claiming she had experienced a \"divine premonition\" that she was destined for higher office from a long dead spiritual guru. Critics also dug up a comment she was said to have made as Maharashtra's health minister in 1975, saying people with hereditary diseases should be sterilized. E-mail to a friend .

Gina Yarbrough sent this picture of the road that collapsed in Wednesday's landslide. Mayor Jerry Sanders declared a state of emergency, asking California and the federal government to help the La Jolla community recover from the Wednesday landslide. As of Thursday morning, he had already received offers of aid from legislators, the governor's office and the White House, he said. Officials warned for at least two weeks that the ground was shifting beneath the hillside community along Soledad Mountain Road. Holes were drilled into the unsettled hillside to investigate the cause and magnitude of the shift, which earlier ruptured a water line, and according to some media reports, began cracking Soledad Mountain Road in July. On Wednesday, a 20-foot-deep chasm opened beneath the road and homes. Holli Weld told San Diego's KGTV that she was walking her son to preschool when the street collapsed.  Watch a resident recall how he had to grab his dogs and run \u00bb . \"The street was sinking before our eyes,\" she said. Authorities told KGTV that most residents were at work and only seven people were in their homes when the landslide occurred. Evacuated homeowner Russell Moore told CNN he remembers hearing the earth \"groan\" in what he called a \"slow avalanche.\" \"The asphalt that should be under my feet was 8 feet in the air,\" Moore said. \"We watched the trees snapping and cracking and more boulders come down to our feet and we were witnessing this move.\"  See photos of the hole the landslide left in La Jolla \u00bb . At least 111 homes were evacuated, but Sanders said residents would be allowed to return to 75 of those houses by early Thursday morning. Several homes were damaged and at least one was destroyed, according to media reports. Nine homes are \"red tagged,\" meaning no one is allowed to enter them, and 27 more are \"yellow tagged,\" which means residents can return for necessities, but cannot stay, Sanders said. According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, the landslide downed power lines and caused a minor gas leak. More than 2,400 customers were briefly left without electricity, but most residents had their power restored by Thursday, KGTV reported. The Red Cross opened a shelter at La Jolla High School. Deputy city engineer Robert Hawk told the Union-Tribune that the hillside has slowly been slipping for years because the soil is unstable. Landslide incidents in the neighborhood date back to the 1960s, Hawk told the newspaper. Pat Abbott, a retired geological sciences professor at San Diego State University, told the Union-Tribune that Mount Soledad is made up of weak layers of rock and that the culprit in the landslide is nature. \"Gravity pulling on the incline is pulling down masses of earth and those masses of earth have houses on top of them,\" Abbott told the paper. \"It's a geologically bad site and should not have been built on to begin with.\" E-mail to a friend .", "677375a4c69e81ab623af7c06a6b0a8d03d6350e": "ABECHE, Chad (CNN) -- Most of the 103 children that a French charity attempted to take to France from Chad for adoption are neither Sudanese nor orphans, three international aid agencies reported on Thursday. Hundreds of women protest child trafficking and shout anti-French slogans Wednesday in Abeche, Chad. Six members of Zoe's Ark were arrested last week as they tried to put the children on a plane to France, where the charity said host families were waiting to take the children in. Three French journalists, a seven-member Spanish flight crew and one Belgian were also arrested. Representatives of the journalists and flight crew said they were unaware of problems with Zoe's Ark and thought they were on a humanitarian mission. Chadian President Idriss Deby hopes the journalists and the flight crew will be freed, his chief of staff, Mahamat Hissene, said Thursday. The president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in the eastern city of Abeche, where the children were taken, to a judge in N'Djamena, the capital, Hissene said. The transfer will take place Monday, according to media reports. The International Red Cross Committee, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and UNICEF said most of the children were living with their families before Zoe's Ark took them. The charity said the children were Sudanese orphans that it was trying to rescue from a war-torn nation. The agencies said most of the children also probably come from Chadian villages along Chad's border with Sudan. The children have been living in an orphanage in Abeche while authorities and aid agencies try to determine their identities.  Watch a report on whether the children are orphans \u00bb . Chadian authorities immediately accused the charity of kidnapping the children and concealing their identities. Chad's interior minister said Zoe's Ark dressed the children in bandages and fake intravenous drips to make them look like refugees who needed medical help. The charity workers and journalists have been charged with kidnapping and extortion and could face 20 years of hard labor if convicted. The Spaniards and Belgian are charged with complicity. The Spanish flight crew is innocent and should be released, a company executive said Thursday. \"We thought we were doing a humanitarian transport,\" said Antoni Cajal, sales director of Spain's Gir Jet charter firm. \"If an NGO [nongovernmental organization] has done something wrong, it's impossible for us to know.\" Spain's Foreign Ministry has publicly expressed its disagreement with the charges and has dispatched top diplomats to Chad to try to win the group's release. Over the weekend, the captain appealed urgently to be rescued, fearing the crew could be harmed or killed, Cajal said. But the four women and three men are in good condition in custody, Cajal said, based on his conversations with a Spanish consular official who came from Cameroon to Chad and has been able to visit them. The detention is the first problem of its kind for the company, which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue, Cajal said. On its Web site, Zoe's Ark describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in Paris that sends teams of physicians, nurses, firefighters and other specialists to care for children in war zones and place them with families in France, who then apply for asylum on their behalf. The Red Cross, UNHCR and UNICEF said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10, and they are healthy. The agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their backgrounds. \"So far, the interviews carried out with the children -- some of whom could not provide any information due to their young age -- led to the preliminary conclusion that probably 85 come from Chadian villages near the cities of Adre and Tine along the Chadian-Sudanese border,\" the agencies said. \"Ninety-one children said they had been living with their family, consisting of at least one adult they considered to be their parent,\" the agencies said, adding that interviews with the remaining 12 children were ongoing. The agencies called their investigation painstaking and challenging because of the number of children, their youth and the situation in the region. Other French charities earlier had questioned whether Zoe's Ark could legally arrange adoption of children from Darfur, and contacted French authorities, according to French newspapers and The Associated Press. French authorities have reacted angrily to the Zoe's Ark trip, calling the group's actions \"illegal and irresponsible.\" The French Foreign Ministry has said the dispute will not affect France's participation in a European peacekeeping force due to be deployed along the border between Chad and Sudan. In response to the dispute in Chad, the Republic of Congo said late Wednesday it was suspending all international adoptions, The Associated Press reported. Reporters Without Borders said it will work for the release of the three journalists arrested in Chad. The organization said photographers Marc Garmirian of the Capa news agency and Jean-Daniel Guillou of the Synchro X agency were on assignment for their news organizations and were not part of the charity's efforts. The third journalist, Marie-Agnes Peleran of the TV station France 3 Miditerranee, was traveling with the group in a personal capacity, though she carried a camera from her station, Reporters Without Borders said.

Fishermen pass by Greenland's Ilulissat fjord in this September 2004 picture. Such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity, even wonder perhaps, but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer. The island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to Greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier. But such a large amount of ice melted, it revealed the distinct island. \"I very quickly realized two things,\" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year. \"One [was] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change.\" \"The other thing was that it meant it was really happening. It wasn't a joke. It wasn't just statistics. It was really happening.\" He calls his discovery Warming Island. Many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's temperature, a trend widely called global warming. Many global warming experts say the phenomenon, if unchecked, is capable of altering the world's climate and geography. In the worst-case scenario, experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels, flooding cities and altering seashores. Other scientists and observers, a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous, say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet's life. Most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere. But why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious. The Earth's temperature averages about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (about 16 degrees Celsius). The average surface temperature has warmed one degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) during the last century, according to the National Research Council. The temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They rose till about 1945, cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day. There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say. A change in the Earth's orbit or the intensity of the sun's radiation could change, triggering warming or cooling. The reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet's temperature at a comfortable level. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, for instance, has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, commonly referred to as the IPCC. The presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels, but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades, according to the EPA. Meanwhile, nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years. Many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests. \"For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it,\" Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said. \"A vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming,\" he added. Many scientific organizations share Schneider's view, ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the G8 to the National Research Council, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union. But there are those who do not share his view, and among the skeptics is Richard Lindzen, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"We've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves,\" he said. \"When we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970, we were proclaiming global cooling. Since then, there's been a few tenths of global warming, so we're proclaiming global warming.\" He believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability, where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal. \"The Earth is always getting colder and warmer,\" he said. \"It's always changing. In fact, this is true of any fluid-covered planet.\" Asked about glacial melt, which many observers point to as evidence of global warming, Lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained. \"We don't know why, but it's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they've occurred,\" he said. \"What we're doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that's occurring due to global warming.\" Yet, for Schneider, it is a cause for concern and alarm. \"We're already in serious melt, nobody can explain it. The models don't predict it,\" he said. \"We don't know what's going on up there. All we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty.\" The greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world's nations. The IPCC in February 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels, temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 4.5 degrees Celsius) by 2100. The lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes, droughts, wildfires and flooding, Schneider said. The higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of Hollywood filmmakers. Uncertainties, however, plague such forecasts, which are based on computer simulations and models. The models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere, oceans and continents interact, all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them. \"Exactly how much it's going to warm up, we don't know,\" Schneider said. \"That it's going to warm up? I'd bet anything on that.\" E-mail to a friend .", "3c19a753303ae0d67b3ae28e070c0f4157ffc52d": "MOGADISHU, Somalia (CNN) -- An enraged crowd dragged the body of an Ethiopian soldier through the streets of Somalia's capital Thursday after gun battles with Islamic insurgents killed 19 people, witnesses reported. In a brutal echo of a 1993 battle involving Somali militias in which the bodies of U.S. troops were dragged through the streets, crowds Thursday shouted \"God is great\" as they pulled the bruised, bullet-riddled corpse through a dusty Mogadishu neighborhood. The body was bound hand and foot with wire and wrapped in a sheet of plastic when insurgents pulled it out of a car and left it with the crowd in the northern Mogadishu neighborhood of Suqa Holaha, witnesses reported. Nine Ethiopians are reportedly part of the 19 dead. Another battle broke out on the city's south side Thursday morning between Ethiopian troops and insurgents armed with heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. The fighting drove hundreds more people from their homes, on top of the tens of thousands aid agencies say have fled in recent weeks. \"Ethiopians will launch violent attacks on us, for some of their comrades have been killed today,\" said Rahma Nor Omar, an elderly woman in the capital. \"They will be like wounded animals.\" Witnesses put the death toll from the day's clashes at 19, including Ethiopian troops, insurgents and civilians. Ethiopian troops arrived in Somalia in December 2006 to help a weak Somali government drive the Islamic Courts Union out of Mogadishu and restore a U.N.-backed transitional government after a decade and a half of near-anarchy. The Islamists responded by launching an insurgency against Somali government and Ethiopian troops that has lasted nearly a year. The United States accused the ICU of harboring suspected al Qaeda figures, including three men wanted in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and raised no objections to Ethiopian presence in Somalia. Washington has long been concerned that Somalia could turn into a safe haven for terrorists, but ICU leaders denied harboring al Qaeda suspects.

Stacy Peterson, 23, has been missing from her suburban Chicago home since October 28. In another development, a judge signed an order to exhume the body of Drew Peterson's third wife, who was found drowned in a bathtub in 2004, said Will County State Attorney James Glasgow. Peterson, 53, said he last spoke to 23-year-old Stacy Peterson -- his fourth wife -- the night of October 28. Drew Peterson initially told the media he believed his wife ran off with another man, but he hasn't repeated that accusation. CNN has been unable to contact Drew Peterson for comment. The couple have been married four years and have two children, who have been interviewed for the investigation, Glasgow said. Drew Peterson also has older children from a previous marriage. Investigators have twice searched the couple's home and vehicles, and removed several items, including computers, said Illinois State Police Capt. Carl Dobrich. Drew Peterson allowed a limited search on the night his wife was reported missing, but investigators were not allowed to look throughout the entire house and were given access to only one of the vehicles at that time, Dobrich said. \"Early on, we looked at this as a missing persons case, but also believed strongly ... it was strongly starting to look at Drew Peterson as being a person of interest,\" Dobrich said. \"I would say that right now, Drew Peterson has gone from being a person of interest to being a suspect.\" New information turned up during the investigation also raised questions about the death of Peterson's third wife, Kathleen Savio, which was ruled an accident by a coroner's jury, Glasgow said. \"There are strong indications that it was a homicide,\" he said. \"That's why we are doing the exhumation, because there are tests that need to be done that weren't done during the first autopsy.\"  Watch why authorities want to exhume the body \u00bb . Glasgow cited abrasions on Savio's body and a gash on her head that could not be readily explained. \"Our main thrust is to determine whether or not it was a homicide, and as we do that, we will see if there is any evidence that implicates anyone,\" he said. Glasgow, who was not state attorney at the time of Savio's death, said he reviewed the case file before deciding to reopen the case. \"With 29 years of experience, there was no doubt in my mind it wasn't an accident,\" he said. \"That was clear.\" In 2002, Savio was charged once with battery and once with domestic battery against her husband, but was found not guilty at trial, Glasgow said. Another time, she tried to bring domestic battery charges against Peterson, but no charges were ever filed. Savio's sister, Sue Doman, said Savio expressed fear of Drew Peterson. \"She told me all the time, 'He's gonna kill me. It's gonna look like an accident,' \" Doman said. Doman said she didn't believe her sister could have died in the way the investigation concluded. \"I don't understand accidental drowning. You just don't drown in the bathtub, especially a small whirlpool. You just don't do that,\" she said. Meanwhile, friends and family of Stacy Peterson said she expressed concerns about her husband. A friend, Steve Cesare, has told CNN he received e-mail from her describing her relationship as abusive. The woman's aunt, Candace Aikin, of El Monte, California, said Stacy Peterson confided in her that there were problems during a visit to the Peterson home in suburban Chicago last month. \"She said that she was afraid because he was following her around 24/7, even inside the house,\" Aikin said. \"He was very obsessed and stalking her, even inside her house. She was very, very full of stress and just not happy in her marriage at all,\" Aikin said.

The country is at a critical and dangerous juncture -- threatened by rising tensions and spreading terrorism, Musharraf said in a televised address to the nation after declaring martial law. As Pakistani police patrolled the streets of the capital, Islamabad, Musharraf said his actions were \"for the good of Pakistan.\"  Watch Musharraf's speech \u00bb . There was quick condemnation from within and outside his country. The Supreme Court declared the state of emergency illegal, claiming Musharraf -- who also is Pakistan's military chief -- had no power to suspend the constitution, Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry said. Shortly afterward, government troops came to Chaudhry's office and told him the president had dismissed him from his job. Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar was quickly appointed to replace him, according to state television. It was the second time Chaudhry was removed from his post. His ousting by Musharraf in March prompted massive protests, and he was later reinstated.  See a timeline of upheaval in Pakistan \u00bb . Musharraf complained in his speech that the media -- which he made independent -- have not been supportive, but have reported \"negative\" news. Early Sunday, two dozen policemen raided the offices of AAJ-TV in Islamabad, saying they had orders to take the station's equipment. The government also issued a directive warning the media that any criticism of the president or prime minister would be punishable by three years in jail and a fine of up to $70,000,  said Talat Hussain, director of news and current affairs for AAJ.

Martial law is only a way to restore law and order, he said. Mahmud Ali Durrani, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, agreed. \"I can assure you, he will move on the part of democracy that is promised ... and you will see that happen shortly.\" Musharraf was re-elected president in October, but the election is not yet legally official, because the Supreme Court is hearing constitutional challenges to Musharraf's eligibility filed by the opposition. Under the constitution, Musharraf couldn't run for another term while serving both as president and military leader. The court allowed the election to go ahead, however, saying it would decide the issue later. Some speculated that the declaration of emergency is tied to rumors the court was planning to rule against Musharraf. Musharraf has said repeatedly he will step down as military leader before the next term begins on November 15 and has promised to hold parliamentary elections by January 15. Meanwhile, popular opposition leader Imran Khan said early Sunday that police surrounded his house in Lahore, barged in and told him he was under house arrest.

Robert A. Singer is accused of sending images depicting child pornography to people he believed to be a 12-year-old girl and her 33-year-old mother, according to a statement issued by U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia of the Southern District of New York. In reality he was communicating with an undercover detective for the New York Police Department. Some of the pornographic images were sent from Singer's computer at the museum, according to an affidavit filed in support of the charges by a special agent who investigates child pornography and child exploitation for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. The Washington museum posted a message on its Web site saying officials there are \"horrified\" by news of Singer's arrest. They reported that he has been suspended from his post, effective immediately, and is barred from the property. Singer, 49, was arrested at his home in Falls Church, Virginia, by federal agents, according to the prosecutors' statement. Authorities allege he engaged in several instant messaging \"chats\" and e-mail communications with the undercover detective, posing as the woman and her daughter, from August  to September. He is charged with five counts of distributing child pornography in interstate commerce. If convicted on each count, he would face a sentence of up to 140 years in prison -- up to 20 years for the first count and up to 40 years for each additional count, prosecutors said. Singer allegedly initiated contact with the undercover detective, posing as the mother, in an America On Line chat room called \"Cuties.\" The chat room attracts people who \"are known to trade in pornographic images, including child pornography,\" according to an affidavit filed in the case by a special agent who investigates child pornography and child exploitation for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \"On five separate occasions in August 2007, Singer sent several images of child pornography over the Internet to the mother and the daughter, including images depicting sexual acts between minors and adults and images depicting known victims of child exploitation,\" prosecutors said. In his communications with the supposed daughter, Singer pretended to be a 15-year-old boy, authorities said. In August 2007, he sent her two images featuring child pornography, according to the affidavit, with the instruction, \"just delete it when you are done.\" A search of Singer's AOL account activity showed that from July to September, he sent about 80 images featuring child pornography to people including the detective, authorities said in the statement. Also, the search revealed that he had received about 10 images and one video depicting child pornography. Singer was expected to appear before a U.S. magistrate judge later Tuesday. He is identified in the complaint as a spokesman for the National Children's Museum, but a spokeswoman who asked not to be identified said he was promoted to chief operating officer within the past few months. He has been employed by the museum for four years, she said. In a written statement, the museum said it was notified by the Department of Homeland Security and ICE of Singer's arrest. \"We are horrified by the charges,\" the statement said. \"This news is deeply upsetting to the National Children's Museum family.\" \"As its essence, the National Children's Museum is about enriching the lives of children,\" the statement said. \"We are educators, child advocates and parents. Anyone who does anything that might endanger the welfare of a child has no place here. Harming children is against everything we stand for as an organization and as individuals.\" The museum, formerly known as the Capital Children's Museum, has been closed to the public since 2004, and operates from administrative offices, the statement said.

Chester Stiles appears Wednesday in a Las Vegas, Nevada, courtroom. Stiles, 37, was taken into custody Monday night after a Henderson, Nevada, police officer pulled over the white Buick Century he was driving. Prosecutors added a couple more charges before Wednesday's hearing, bringing the total to 23 felony counts, including a charge of lewdness with a minor, sexual assault and the use of a child in the production of pornography, according to a statement issued by the Clark County, Nevada, court. One of the lewdness charges stems from a 2004 incident, while the others are related to the videotape, the court said. Judge Deborah Lippis set November 19 as the date for the preliminary hearing. After the hearing, Stiles' court-appointed attorney said his client was overwhelmed by the public opinion in the case. \"I think he's a little out of it,\" public defender Jeff Banks said. Jerry T. Donohue, the attorney for the girl's mother, told CNN that the child on the videotape was younger than 3 when the abuse occurred. The girl, who is now 7, was found last month after a nationwide search. The girl's mother said on \"The Dr. Phil Show\" Wednesday that she was \"relieved\" about Stiles' arrest, although it would have been \"better if they found him dead.\" The woman said she will testify against Stiles if the case goes to court. She told Phil McGraw that her daughter remembers nothing about the videotaped assault and that she recently had a conversation with the girl about inappropriate touching. She said her daughter told her that if someone touched her inappropriately, the girl would scream and tell her mother. But, she told McGraw, \"I don't trust anybody now.\" Although she is in a relationship with a man her daughter calls \"Dad,\" she said, \"I don't feel comfortable leaving her with him, nor with anybody else. ... I just cry and blame it on myself.\" Eight-and-a-half months pregnant, she said the incident has placed a lot of strain on her. Asked if she would rather not have known about the assault, she said, \"Yes, I could have lived without knowing it.\" A former girlfriend of Stiles' said that, before the arrest, she lived in fear after going to police to identify the suspect after seeing enhanced photos from the videotape on the local news. \"I've had my share of nightmares,\" Elaine Thomas told CNN's Nancy Grace. Thomas said she screamed when she recognized the photos on television and had no choice but to contact police about the man she had thought was a \"weapons enthusiast\" with only a minor criminal record.  Watch Thomas say how she felt when she saw the photos \u00bb . \"How could I not tell them who that man was? That little girl suffered unimaginable things, and I knew for a fact it was him,\" Thomas said. Another former girlfriend of Stiles', Tina Allen, said this month she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is \"mortified\" by the allegations against him. \"He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,\" Allen said. Allen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, the alleged assault victim. Todd Allen, Tina Allen's son, said he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video.  E-mail to a friend .

Steyn's career-best 5-34 was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests. New Zealand were bowled out for 118 in reply to South Africa's 226 and the home side piled on the agony by reaching 179 for two in their second innings. Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis shared an unbeaten stand of 159 as South Africa stretched their lead to 287. South Africa's bowlers excelled to bring their side back into the game after their disappointing first innings. They snapped up five wickets in the morning session when the Kiwis could only muster 56 runs. Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming made 40 but the next best score was new cap Ross Taylor's 15. Fleming was struck on the right forearm by Steyn and did not field during the afternoon. Coach John Bracewell said he had gone for precautionary X-rays but there was only bruising. New Zealand, 41 for two overnight, lost nightwatchman Shane Bond, bowled by a Steyn yorker, before Makhaya Ntini claimed the crucial wicket of Fleming, who was well caught by AB de Villiers diving to his left at third slip. Scott Styris and Taylor scraped 19 runs in 10 overs before more wickets tumbled. Steyn's figures bettered his previous best of five for 47 against the same opponents at Centurion two seasons ago. It was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests. Ntini took three for 47 and Kallis two for 11. South Africa made an uncertain start to their second innings with openers Herschelle Gibbs and captain Graeme Smith out cheaply, but Amla and Kallis blunted the attack and then took charge. They batted together for 205 minutes, Amla facing 230 balls and hitting 13 boundaries in his 85 while Kallis hit 12 fours off 122 deliveries in reaching 76. The Kiwis were left to regret  Brendon McCullum's failure to hold a chance from Amla off Shane Bond, when the batsman had only scored two. \"The ball was hard and new and we were trying to get momentum. It cost us a lot,\" said coach John Bracewell. E-mail to a friend .", "5ba0d22ccba29ac8a3c77da069165d6016f5a214": "(Real Simple) -- Here are five great ways to enjoy your summer.

Take it from lifeguard Benjamin Guss, 25, of Del Mar, California, who recently qualified to compete in this year's Iron Man triathlon (yes, that means swimming 2.4 miles, biking 112 miles, and then running a marathon -- consecutively) in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. Beware, shoeless Joes.

You may work foot and leg muscles you don't always use, so start slowly. And hard sand can be as tough on your legs as the road, so wear running sneakers. Pick the right time to run. \"My favorite time is in the evening,\" says Guss. \"The wind dies down, and the sand isn't that hot.\" To work harder, fill small bags with sand to use as hand weights.

Iraqi students at the Shmisani school in Amman gather around a teacher. One in 5 students there is Iraqi. \"All Iraqi girls come outside now. All Iraqi girls. Iraqi girls only!\" she repeats several times, making sure the message is clear and waving away Jordanian pupils attracted by the commotion. Dozens of girls in green apron-like uniforms pour out into the courtyard and cluster on the top level of a stone staircase overlooking a concrete playground. Harb wants the CNN crew to see how many Iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating. This school year, she says, 145 students are Iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 Iraqi children on a waiting list.  Watch Iraqi girls describe a long way from home \u00bb . The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government policy: For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools. Simply, this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked. The move is cementing a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than 2.2 million Iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland, most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria, according to humanitarian officials. Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid Touqan says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year. That's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago. Harb, on the front line of the phenomenon, says the influx is putting a strain on her school. Even with some U.N. and U.S. aid to Jordan, there's still not enough money. \"We need more teachers here, more resources, more buildings, more chairs for all Iraqi students and our students,\" she says. In a nearby neighborhood, in the study room of the Ahmed Toukan School for Boys, a handful of Iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home. Seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth, the boys tell stories of horror and displacement. Eighteen-year-old Qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to Jordan to try to live a normal life. Matter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare, he repeats the number: \"Five members.\" Most of the boys and young men from Iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation, but also their entry into the workforce. All say, though, that they feel lucky to have gotten out, even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move, ready to live far from home and away from loved ones. \"It's not strange for me to be in the middle of people I don't know,\" says eleventh grader Ziad Tarek Al Shamsi. \"I had friends in Iraq when I was small, I left them. In America, I left them. I came here, I left them.\" He pauses: \"But you have to miss your country.\" The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age Iraqi children are in Jordan. Many of them are enrolled in private institutions. But as families run out of money they had when they left Iraq, they turn to public schools. Even so, more than a month into the new academic year, fewer Iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year. According to the charity Save the Children, 21,000 Iraqi children have so far enrolled in Jordanian classrooms. As a result, the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for Iraqi families. The lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees' fears of being identified through their children's school records. Regardless of what the final number will be this year, the population shift in the Middle East is, according to UNHCR head Antonio Guterres, the largest urban refugee situation in the world. Iraqi families are changing the social fabric of Jordanian society. About 10 percent of Jordan's population is now made up of Iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them. The schoolchildren are living examples of how the Iraq war may permanently change the Middle East. \"Iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education,\" says Touqan, the education minister. \"We will not run a parallel system of education.\" E-mail to a friend .", "fb6516de631cade629b797e8f40f377523c4aa0e": "(CNN) -- After weeks of controversy over Michael Mukasey's views on waterboarding, the Senate late Thursday approved the former judge's nomination for attorney general by a 53-40 vote. Waterboarding threatened to derail the approval of President Bush's nominee to lead the Justice Department. President Bush nominated Mukasey to replace longtime ally Alberto Gonzales, who resigned in September. The nomination had been considered at risk after a number of Democratic senators opposed Mukasey because of questions that arose from his views on the terror interrogation technique known as waterboarding and the president's power to order electronic surveillance. Mukasey, a former federal judge in New York, told senators he considers waterboarding \"repugnant,\" but he could not categorically say whether the technique amounts to torture, which U.S. and international law bans. Waterboarding is a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on him to produce the sensation of drowning. Mukasey's confirmation was all but assured last week when two key Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee -- Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Chuck Schumer of New York -- said they would vote in favor of Mukasey despite the controversy. \"The Department of Justice, once the crown jewel among government institutions, is adrift and rudderless,\" Schumer said Tuesday -- the same day the committee voted 11-8 to send Mukasey's nomination to the Senate floor. \"It desperately needs a strong and independent leader at the helm to set it back on course and I believe Judge Mukasey is that person.\" Schumer said that in a meeting Friday the nominee said that Congress would be within its rights to pass a law that bans waterboarding across all government agencies and that the president \"would have absolutely no legal authority to ignore\" it. Schumer said he believed Mukasey would be more likely to find waterboarding illegal than an interim attorney general. \"Indeed, his written answers to our notices have demonstrated more openness to ending the practices we abhor than either of this president's previous attorney general nominees have.\" But Mukasey's pledge to enforce such a law rang hollow with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the Judiciary Committee's chairman. \"Some have sought to find comfort in Judge Mukasey's personal assurance that he would enforce a future, new law against waterboarding if this Congress were to pass one,\" Leahy said Tuesday. \"Unsaid, of course, is the fact that any such prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of this president.\" However, the committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said he believed Mukasey would enforce a law banning waterboarding. \"He could have said a lot of things which would have given me more assurances,\" Specter said earlier. \"But he is intelligent; he's really learned in the law. He's strong, ethical, honest beyond any question. He's not an intimate of the president.\" A majority of Americans consider waterboarding a form of torture, but some of those say it's OK for the U.S. government to use the technique, according to a poll released Tuesday. Asked whether they think waterboarding is a form of torture, more than two-thirds of respondents, or 69 percent, said yes; 29 percent said no. Asked whether they think the U.S. government should be allowed to use the procedure to try to get information from suspected terrorists, 58 percent said no; 40 percent said yes. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. telephone poll of 1,024 American adults was carried out over the weekend and had a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

The mountain spring that supplies water to the town usually dries up at the end of summer, but just for a few days. This year it dried up early, on August 1, and hasn't revived, leaving the town's 145 residents high and dry and relying on water trucked in from the next state. Every day at 6 p.m., Orme Mayor Tony Reames turns a big valve to release water from the town's tank. When he turns the crank again at 9 p.m., taps in the town run dry. \"When they cut it back on we jump for joy,\" Orme resident Debbie Cash said. \"And then you only have it for three hours.\" Three hours to do all the laundry, bathing, dishwashing and animal watering that has to be done.

Just 150 miles to the southeast, the 4.5 million people who live in and around Atlanta, Georgia, are nervously watching water levels go down at their major reservoir. The drought has highlighted an ongoing struggle between Georgia, Alabama and Florida over rights to water from the Chattahoochee River. \"All of these people that are on the river systems better take note, because once your streams and tributaries to the river start drying up, the river isn't far behind,\" Reames said.  See photos of a Atlanta's shrinking Lake Lanier reservoir \u00bb . Volunteers take turns three days a week driving a tanker truck or Orme's diesel-belching 1961 fire truck to a hydrant near Bridgeport, Alabama, 2\u00bd miles down the road. Making several round trips, they haul about 25,000 gallons of water back to Orme each day. Bridgeport, which gets its water from the Tennessee River, doesn't charge its neighbor. Stevenson and New Hope, Alabama, also help out, occasionally bringing trucks full of water to the hydrant, where it's transferred to the Orme trucks.  See where Orme has to go for water \u00bb . But things are looking up in Orme. A pipeline from Bridgeport is nearly complete, built with the help of a $378,000 grant from the federal government. \"With this new water coming in, then we'll have it made,\" Cash said. \"Now we won't have to worry about it no more.\" In addition, an Austin, Texas, company called H2O Guard is planning to donate water-saving sink aerators, shower heads and toilet valves to everyone in Orme  on November 17, company spokesman Robert Easter said. \"We think we're going to get another 90 gallons' savings per day per household,\" Easter said. \"That'll make that little water tower in that town go from three hours to four hours without any change in anyone's habits.\" Reames said residents have found creative ways to conserve, flushing toilets with condensation water from air conditioners and undrinkable water from swimming pools that were filled early in the summer. It's a lesson for everyone. \"Cherish the water you got and be kind of careful with it,\" Cash said, \"because you never know if you will be out of water.\" E-mail to a friend .

The toys have caused some children who swallowed the craft toys to vomit and lose consciousness. China suspended exports of the Aqua Dots toys that contain a chemical that converts into a \"date rape\" drug. The agency said that the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine (AQSIQ) has ordered an investigation by quality control agencies and will release results as soon as they are available. The AQSIQ did not reveal the name of the toys' producer, Xinhua said. U.S. safety officials voluntarily recalled about 4.2 million of the Chinese-made toys Wednesday. Scientists have found the highly popular holiday toy contains a chemical that, once metabolized, converts into the toxic \"date rape\" drug GHB (gamma-hydroxy butyrate), Scott Wolfson, a spokesman with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), told CNN. \"Children who swallow the beads can become comatose, develop respiratory depression or have seizures,\" a CPSC statement warned. The arts-and-craft beads, which have been selling since April at major U.S. retail stores under the name \"Aqua Dots,\" have also been distributed in Australia under the name \"Bindeez Beads.\" The Bindeez toys were recalled Tuesday by Melbourne-based Moose Enterprise Pty. Ltd. after three children in Australia swallowed large quantities of the beads and were hospitalized. \"I was so frightened because I thought she wasn't going to make it,\" Heather Lehane told CNN affiliate Network 7 of her 10-year-old daughter, Charlotte, who was hospitalized in Australia after ingesting some of the beads. In the United States, the Washington-based safety commission said it has in recent days received two reports detailing the severe effects of the digested beads, which are part of a craft kit aimed at kids 4 years and older. The CPSC said a boy nearly 2 years old \"swallowed several dozen beads. He became dizzy and vomited several times before slipping into a comatose state for a period of time.\" The commission said the toddler was hospitalized and has since \"fully recovered.\" The second incident involved a child who vomited, fell into a coma and was hospitalized for five days. It was not immediately clear whether the child had made a full recovery. Toronto-based toy distributor Spin Master Ltd. stopped shipping the Aqua Dots toys and asked retailers to pull them off their shelves, where they were previously sold for $17 to $30. Anyone with Aqua Dots at home should return the product to the company, CPSC spokeswoman Julie Vallese said. The toy had been named toy of the year in Australia and recently crested Wal-Mart's list of top 12 Christmas toys. Wal-Mart on Thursday listed the toys on its Web site as \"out of stock online\" and had removed them from their top toy list as well. This latest recall is part of a larger batch of recalls of Chinese-made toys that have swept across the country. Last month alone, U.S. government safety officials and retailers voluntarily recalled at least 69,000 Chinese-made toys over concerns of excessive amounts of lead paint, which can cause hazardous lead poisoning.

Refugees move along a road Tuesday in Mugunga, near Goma, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A press release from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it didn't appear rebels had targeted the camps, but it reported some were looted after camp residents, classified as internally displaced persons, fled. Roads to Goma, about 10 miles from the camps, were crowded with refugees and local residents fleeing the fighting, the UNHCR reported. Torrential rain made the movement even more difficult. \"The main road toward Sake was crowded with people; we had difficulties getting through,\" UNHCR field safety adviser Pierre Nazroo was quoted as saying in the agency's release. \"Internally displaced people are moving from site to site, direction Goma.\" UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said, \"They have been living in extremely difficult conditions anyway. Now they have nothing but what they can carry.\" Redmond added, \"These are people in poor health; they are soaking wet because of the torrential downpours. They need shelter, they need water, they need a lot of assistance so we're going to have to move quickly to get that help to them because a lot of them are already in a weakened state.\" While the Congolese government accused troops under rebel general Laurent Nkunda of staging the attack, a Nkunda spokesman denied the allegation, according to a report from the Integrated Regional Information Networks, a U.N.-affiliated news service. The spokesman, Bwambale Kakolele, said Rwandan Hutu rebels who also operate in the area were behind the attack, that report said. A spokesman for the U.N. military mission in the Congo said it was uncertain which group attacked the Congo army outpost near the village of Kishangazi, according to the U.N.-affiliated news service. \"We think it could have been insurgents close to Nkunda who attacked, but we cannot rule out the [Rwandan rebels],\" spokesman Col. Pierre Cherayron was quoted as saying. The UNHCR identified the affected camps as Mugunga I, Mugunga II, Lac Vert and Bulengo, saying about 28,000 had abandoned the first three camps and about 2,000 had left Bulengo. The UNHCR said 375,000 Congolese in North Kivu province have been forced from their homes in the past year. In the past two months alone, 160,000 have fled their homes amid the fighting between renegade troops and government forces, the agency said. North Kivu is in eastern Congo near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda. Congolese President Joseph Kabila has tried to gain a cease-fire with the rebels in the area under Nkunda, but fighting continues as hard-liners among the rebels and in the government have blocked reconciliation efforts, according to the International Crisis Group, an nongovernmental organization looking for solutions to conflicts.

Of a \"wild and gamey\" red from Rioja, Spain, Vaynerchuk says, \"Hit a deer on the road. Throw a bunch of cherries on it. Take out your knife, cut the deer. Bite it. That's the flavor profile.\" That kind of attitude appeals to people who are mystified by the arcane lexicon of traditional wine journals or turned off by what they perceive as elitist barriers. Across the Internet, budding wine geeks are discovering a burgeoning number of Web sites, blogs, bulletin boards and other outlets that preach the gospel of the grape in terms they can understand. About 40,000 Internet viewers  -- many of them 20-somethings -- have a daily appointment with \"Wine Library TV.\" The low-budget video blog is produced five days a week from a nondescript office in the three-level wine retail operation that Vaynerchuk's family owns in Springfield, New Jersey. Vaynerchuk has a discerning nose and palate, and he doesn't dumb down his subject. Yet he stuffs his patter with sports and pop-culture references -- and the kind of language a Wine Spectator critic would be unlikely to employ. The mission of wine sites like \"Wine Library TV,\" say several of the people behind these new outlets, is to demystify wine (and in some cases, sell it, too). Using the language, attitude and new media that appeal to a young, tech-savvy generation, they advocate trusting one's own palate rather than obeying powerful wine critics. Some of the sites also provide opportunities for average wine drinkers to share their opinions. One site, SavorEachGlass.com, declares its dedication to \"exploring the spirit of wine for a new generation,\" with reviews, online journals and essays that explain the finer points of winemaking  -- all with attitude. \"The (wine) establishment is about ratings and 'reputation,'\" says the site's founder, Tynan Szvetecz, 29. \"It's about collecting the 'good' stuff as defined by someone else's palate and tastes. That bores a younger generation.\" \"We're not afraid to be smartasses,\" he continues. \"We make fun of ourselves, old-world wine makers, new-world wine makers, and anyone else we can get our hands on.\" In the U.S., interest in wine is exploding. While consumption has leveled out in traditional wine-producing countries such as France, Italy and Spain, especially among young people, it has trended upwards in the U.S. for 15 straight years. The U.S. is projected to overtake No. 2 Italy by the end of 2007, according to the annual report The U.S. Wine Market: Impact Databank Review and Forecast a leading industry trade publication. Many of the new converts to wine are the so-called Millennials, the under-30 age group coveted by beverage marketers and so comfortable online that they're also called iGen, or the Internet Generation. One of the wine Web sites targeting a younger demographic is VineSugar.com, which features a blog called \"Wine Burps.\" \"We love wine but hate the elitism,\" writes founder, Ryan O'Donnell. \"After all, it's just grape juice.\" With rants about wine tasting fees, a feature spotlighting \"wine hotties\" working at California wineries, as well as interactive maps that plot and rate wineries, VineSugar.com leaves little doubt about its target audience. CellarTracker.com, an online wine community, appeals to more established wine collectors. The site provides free software  -- designed by Eric LeVine, a fortuitously named former Microsoft software developer  -- that allows wine enthusiasts to create an online inventory of their wines. The 39,000 users (who count 6 million bottles in their virtual cellars) post reviews of their wines and access scores and other data via PDAs and cell phones. Community tasting notes shed light on how cellar-worthy wines are evolving, helping others decide when to crack open a treasured bottle. Corkd.com, another online community of wine fans, already had 40,000 users when Vaynerchuk purchased the site last year. The free service allows users to catalog and review wines. Instead of having \"friends\" as on Facebook, members identify \"drinking buddies\" and check out what they're drinking. In the growing presence of wine fans on the Internet -- newbies as well as connoisseurs -- Vaynerchuk sees a movement. \"They're part of forums, they meet up (offline),\" he says. \"It's about bringing people together. It's all that's right about wine.\" Vaynerchuk should know. The 300-plus shows he has taped in the past two years have developed a cult following of online fans, who call themselves \"Vayniacs,\" share wine tips and obsess about their hero on the site's forum. On a recent rainy afternoon, Vaynerchuk barreled, unrehearsed and unscripted, through a 20-minute show in a single take. He wrapped up Wine Library TV episode No. 337 with what has become his signature line. \"You, with a little bit of me, we're changing the wine world, aren't we?\" E-mail to a friend .

Iraqi students at the Shmisani school in Amman gather around a teacher. One in 5 students there is Iraqi. \"All Iraqi girls come outside now. All Iraqi girls. Iraqi girls only!\" she repeats several times, making sure the message is clear and waving away Jordanian pupils attracted by the commotion. Dozens of girls in green apron-like uniforms pour out into the courtyard and cluster on the top level of a stone staircase overlooking a concrete playground. Harb wants the CNN crew to see how many Iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating. This school year, she says, 145 students are Iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 Iraqi children on a waiting list.  Watch Iraqi girls describe a long way from home \u00bb . The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government policy: For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools. Simply, this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked. The move is cementing a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than 2.2 million Iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland, most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria, according to humanitarian officials. Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid Touqan says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year. That's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago. Harb, on the front line of the phenomenon, says the influx is putting a strain on her school. Even with some U.N. and U.S. aid to Jordan, there's still not enough money. \"We need more teachers here, more resources, more buildings, more chairs for all Iraqi students and our students,\" she says. In a nearby neighborhood, in the study room of the Ahmed Toukan School for Boys, a handful of Iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home. Seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth, the boys tell stories of horror and displacement. Eighteen-year-old Qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to Jordan to try to live a normal life. Matter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare, he repeats the number: \"Five members.\" Most of the boys and young men from Iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation, but also their entry into the workforce. All say, though, that they feel lucky to have gotten out, even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move, ready to live far from home and away from loved ones. \"It's not strange for me to be in the middle of people I don't know,\" says eleventh grader Ziad Tarek Al Shamsi. \"I had friends in Iraq when I was small, I left them. In America, I left them. I came here, I left them.\" He pauses: \"But you have to miss your country.\" The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age Iraqi children are in Jordan. Many of them are enrolled in private institutions. But as families run out of money they had when they left Iraq, they turn to public schools. Even so, more than a month into the new academic year, fewer Iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year. According to the charity Save the Children, 21,000 Iraqi children have so far enrolled in Jordanian classrooms. As a result, the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for Iraqi families. The lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees' fears of being identified through their children's school records. Regardless of what the final number will be this year, the population shift in the Middle East is, according to UNHCR head Antonio Guterres, the largest urban refugee situation in the world. Iraqi families are changing the social fabric of Jordanian society. About 10 percent of Jordan's population is now made up of Iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them. The schoolchildren are living examples of how the Iraq war may permanently change the Middle East. \"Iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education,\" says Touqan, the education minister. \"We will not run a parallel system of education.\" E-mail to a friend .", "ceb7a288ac1ad604a17bc25c5978fcc87b1a4446": "PATUAKHALI, Bangladesh (CNN)  -- Survivors of a storm that killed more than 3,000 people in the impoverished nation of Bangladesh grieved and buried their loved ones Monday as they waited for aid to arrive. Villagers grieve in Patargata, around 125 miles south of Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh, Monday. The number of dead killed from Cyclone Sidr -- now at 3,114 -- is expected to rise yet further as the South Asian nation continues to assess the damage. The Bangladesh Red Crescent fears the death toll could be 5,000 -- perhaps even reaching as high as 10,000. In the fishing village of Galachipa, in Patuakhali district, Dhalan Mridha was grieving for family members who died in the cyclone after ignoring an alert issued by authorities. \"Nothing is going to happen. That was our first thought and we went to bed. Just before midnight the winds came like hundreds of demons. Our small hut was swept away like a piece of paper, and we all ran for shelter,\" Mridha, a 45-year-old farm worker, told The Associated Press. On the way to a shelter, Mridha lost contact with his wife, mother and two children. The next morning he found their bodies. The Category 4 cyclone raked Bangladesh's southwest coast on Thursday with maximum sustained winds of 241 km/h (150 mph), destroying fishermen's hamlets and villages. Thousands are still missing, while an estimated 280,000 others are unable to return to their homes which were wiped out by the storm. Many grieving families are now burying loved ones in single graves as no male members are available to dig them. Most houses in the region are made of flimsy materials such as bamboo and corrugated iron, and had no chance of withstanding the storm's powerful winds. In addition, the storm-struck area is criss-crossed by a huge river delta which surged as Sidr pushed through, wiping out many villages and littering the river's shores with debris.  Watch as people are left to fend for themselves \u00bb . Low-lying Bangladesh is already prone to flooding which has wiped out the country's rice production -- a major food staple for the impoverished country. Improved warning systems and shelters have kept the number of deaths far lower than the disastrous cyclones in the region of 1970 and 1991, when the tolls were in the hundreds of thousands. Bangladesh President Iajuddin Ahmed visited the devastated region Sunday, handing out some aid to the crowds of people before members of the international media. It was seen largely a token effort as hundreds were left empty-handed and furious. Security officials struggled to hold back the crowd.  See dramatic photos of storm survivors \u00bb . Sidr has already ruined Bangladesh's rice harvest, but the international community is rallying to make sure the country does not suffer as acutely as it has in the past. Nearly a million people died after massive floods wiped out the country's rice production in 1974. International aid organizations promised initial packages of $25 million during a meeting with Bangladesh agencies Monday, the U.N.'s World Food Program said. The United States has offered more than $2 million as an initial contribution for emergency relief, and sent two U.S. Navy carriers to help in recovery operations. In addition, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is airlifting in relief supplies and an 18-person Department of Defense medical team is in Bangladesh helping the estimated 15,000 injured by the storm. Bangladesh's government held an emergency Cabinet meeting Saturday to assess the disaster and discuss recovery issues, Bangladeshi government spokesman Fahim Munaim told CNN. Officials fear the scope of the destruction may be much more extensive since there are remote areas where conditions cannot yet be determined. Munaim said nearly a third of Bangladesh's 64 districts were affected by the cyclone, most of those along the southern coast. The Bangladeshi military is working to provide shelter for the many people who have been displaced. International aid groups -- including Save the Children, World Vision, and the Red Crescent, which already have offices in Bangladesh -- are deploying resources to the cyclone-stricken region but -- like the government -- they have found it nearly impossible to reach the more remote areas to assess conditions. Roads to remote areas are either blocked by massive trees fallen by the storm, or so severely damaged that it is impossible for vehicles to use. Clearing could take weeks in the remote areas because it must be done by hand -- there are no chainsaws and modern machinery to speed up the process. Along the broken road that leads into Kolapara, the body of an 8-year-old girl called Rummie was carefully carried away for burial. Overwhelmed with sadness, her mother Khadija was steadied by a relative. \"I am feeling too much pain in my heart,\" she said. \"I have lost my daughter, so I am a victim of the cyclone as well.\" E-mail to a friend .

Luca Toni celebrates his early goal as Italy won 2-1 in Scotland to clinch qualification from Group B. Luca Toni shot Italy in front but Scotland recovered to dominate and Barry Ferguson bundled home a 65th-minute leveller. However, Christian Panucci headed an injury-time winner after a controversial decision to award Italy a free-kick. The result also means France have sealed qualification, along with Italy, from Group B without playing a game. In a match played in torrential rain, Italy enjoyed the best possible start by taking the lead after just 70 seconds.    Gianluca Zambrotta spotted Antonio Di Natale unmarked in the box, and picked him out with a throw-in as Scotland were caught napping. Di Natale swept the ball into the path of Toni who delicately flicked into the top left corner from six meters out. The home side almost conceded a second goal 60 seconds later. This time, Toni turned provider and his cut-back was met by Mauro Camoranesi who fired over from close-range. Toni then shrugged off two challenges before drawing a decent save from Craig Gordon with a well-struck effort that the goalkeeper did well to block at the near post. At the other end, Scotland were denied the opportunity to haul themselves back into the match when a thunderous drive from Lee McCulloch appeared to be handled by Zambrotta inside the area but penalty claims were ignored. Spurred on by a sense of injustice, the hosts cranked up the pressure on their visitors. Ferguson fired over from a James McFadden corner, before Alan Hutton nodded agonisingly wide of the upright following another perfect delivery from the Everton man. Scotland then produced some wonderful passing football, which culminated in a tight-angled drive from Ferguson, but Gianluigi Buffon dived low to smother. Then came another scare for the home side. Gordon was forced to pull a save out of the top drawer to deny a point-blank effort from Massimo Ambrosini, before Di Natale rifled the rebound into the back of the net. The assistant referee raised his flag for offside but television replays suggested the official may have called it wrong. Only last-gasp defending from the Italians prevented the Scots from grabbing a morale-boosting leveller on the stroke of half-time. David Weir rose above everyone else in a packed box to meet Ferguson's corner and his header appeared to be heading for the top corner before Andrea Pirlo somehow managed to nod off the line. A free-kick in a dangerous area provided Italy with the chance to start the second half as emphatically as they had started the first when Paul Hartley hauled down Camoranesi just outside the box. Pirlo seized on the chance and looped the ball over the wall but, despite a reputation as a dead-ball specialist, his effort was easily dealt with by Gordon. Instead, it was Scotland who found the back of the net as Hampden erupted with 65 minutes gone. McFadden's free-kick deflected into the path of McCulloch in front of goal. He was denied by Buffon, but the rebound fell kindly to Ferguson and the captain gratefully rifled home from close-range. With just over 15 minutes to go, Scott Brown was withdrawn for Kenny Miller as Scotland went for broke. The Derby striker quickly began to cause the Italians problems and delivered a wonderful diagonal cross to the feet of McFadden but he fired wide when it looked easier score. Scotland's impossible dream ended in the cruellest possible way when Italy snatched a last minute goal to secure their own qualification for Euro 2008. Hutton appeared to be barged over in front of the corner flag but the referee inexplicably awarded the free-kick the other way and Panucci rose to meet Pirlo's cross and nod home the winner. Italy coach Roberto Donadoni said: \"We knew it was going to be a physical match given the atmosphere. \"But through their character and desire, the lads were fantastic. They worked so hard, they deserve this. Qualifying for Euro 2008 is amazing. It's something positive after all that happened last week (the death of the Lazio fan).\" Captain Fabio Cannavaro: \"This was a victory won with the heart. It was difficult to play in this stadium, with that atmosphere it was like a cauldron. \"We played really well and managed to win. We showed once again that we are a strong and compact team and when we need to win we do everything to show that we are the world champions. \"In Italy we play a high level of football, we've won the Champions League and the World Cup but unfortunately at this moment we are being noticed for something else.\"  E-mail to a friend .", "c44238ec87e7fc40ab7fe6e724cfcbf301e01216": "(CNN) -- Authorities in Azerbaijan recently uncovered a radical Islamic terror plot against the U.S. Embassy in the capital, Baku, prompting the facility to close its doors to the public Monday, Azerbaijan and U.S. officials told CNN. The Bibi Heybat Mosque, just outside the capital Baku. As a precaution, Britain also shut its embassy in Baku to the public on Monday \"following security concerns nearby,\" Britain's Foreign Office said. The terror plot was unraveled after a weekend raid outside Baku that netted several suspected members of the radical group, two U.S. officials who asked not to be identified and a spokesman for Azerbaijan's National Security Ministry told CNN. U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack stressed that the details \"are still unfolding,\" and the threat \"may or may not be\" linked to the Saturday raid. \"There were some specific and credible threat information concerning the embassy and plans by militants to in some way do harm to individuals in and around the U.S. Embassy there,\" McCormack said, noting that no specific individuals were targeted. Several days ago, an Azerbaijani army officer who had connections to a radical Islamic group seized four assault rifles, a machine gun and 20 hand grenades from his military unit and hid them in the outskirts of Baku, the ministry spokesman and U.S. officials said. Government security forces tracked down the group and arrested several members during a sweep on Saturday in the village of Mastaga, about 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Baku, the spokesman said. One suspected member of the militant group resisted arrest and was killed in the sweep, the spokesman said. Several others are still at large, he added. He said the terror plot also targeted Azerbaijani government buildings. The U.S. Embassy in Baku issued a warden message warning Americans in Azerbaijan to take precautions. \"While there is no information at this time that other American or Western interests in Azerbaijan are being targeted, the U.S. Embassy encourages Americans to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster their own personal security,\" it said. Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic that borders the Caspian Sea, and lies just north of Iran. McCormack said U.S. authorities are working closely with their counterparts in Baku and will determine when normal embassy operations will resume. He said he expects the embassy to limit its operations on Tuesday, as well. E-mail to a friend .

Fabrice Santoro returns the ball during his shock second-round victory against Novak Djokovic. The 34-year-old Santoro, who beat world No. 5 Andy Roddick at the Lyon Grand Prix last week, again rose to the occasion in front of his home fans as he stormed to a 6-3 6-2 second-round victory against the Serb. It was the first time the two players had met, with Djokovic making his first outing since losing to David Nalbandian in the semifinals of the Madrid Masters two weeks ago. Djokovic, like the American Roddick, has already qualified for the season-ending Masters Cup and will now have extra time to prepare for the event in Shanghai starting next month. The 20-year-old said he was struggling following dental surgery to remove two wisdom teeth. \"I couldn't give my 100 percent, not even 30 percent of my possibilities,\" Djokobvic said. \"He deserved to win. I'm still on medications. I didn't practise for a whole week, I only started practising two days ago. Physically, I'm not feeling at all good.\" The result is a boost for rising British star Andy Murray, who earlier kept alive his hopes of an unexpected place at the Masters Cup by winning his first match in Paris and was expected to face Djokovic. The 20-year-old, who has missed three months this season due to a wrist injury, beat Jarkko Nieminen of Finland 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 to progress into the third round. The 15th seed is seeking to overtake Tommy Haas, who holds the eighth and final place ahead of the showpiece event in Shanghai. Murray, who trails the German by just three points, has not beaten Djokovic in three meetings so far but he has never played his unseeded next opponent Santoro. Ninth seed Haas, who has struggled with illness and injury this year, will play Djokovic's compatriot Janko Tipsarevic in the second round. Murray, who won his second title this year at the St Petersburg Open last Sunday, made a confident start against Nieminen and showed little sign of the stiff back he suffered after a minor car crash on Monday. He held his serve to love against a player who was beaten in the final of the Swiss Indoors event by Roger Federer last weekend, but then struggled for his best form as the first set went to a tiebreak. The Scot was broken just one point after having a winner overturned following an on-court appeal, but he leveled immediately and then broke Nieminen again to win a third successive game before serving out for victory. Defending champin and fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko, one of six players to have already qualified for Shanghai, beat Argentina's Juan Del Potro 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 in his opening match on Wednesday. The Russian, fined for \"lack of effort\" after his defeat by Croatian qualifier Marian Cilic in St Petersburg, will next face Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus in round three after Baghdatis shocked 13th seed Ivan Ljubicic. Ivo Karlovic broke Roger Federer's serve for the first time in his life, but the top seed and world number one progressed in a late match on Wednesday. Croatian Karlovic, the tallest man in tennis at 2.08 metres, went down 6-4 4-6 6-3 as Federer played for the first time at the Bercy event since 2003. Federer had gone 67 service games over four previous matches without a loss before Karlovic ended his duck to claim their second set. But the Swiss top seed got straight back in harness, breaking to start the final set and rolling ahead against a man he had just beaten days earlier in the Basel semifinals. World numbet two Rafael Nadal also reached the third round after thrashing Italy's Filippo Volandri 6-3 6-1.

Lipstick outsold gloss by $76 million last year, and beauty companies are racing to launch new formulas that are more wearable than ever. So pucker up. We'll show you how to apply lipstick perfectly, along with the most flattering shades for day and night. For foolproof application, stick with sheer, subdued shades in the morning and save deep, bold colors (which require more time and precision) for night. Daytime equation . 1. Condition and protect with a balm that contains sunscreen, like Softlips Raspberry with Green Tea SPF 20. \"Dab some on immediately after getting out of the shower, when your lips are still a little moist,\" suggests Hollywood pro Kara Yoshimoto Bua. The smoother your lips, the more perfect your lipstick will look. 2. Choose a soft shade such as rose or nude that you can apply straight from the tube. A hydrating formula ensures a smooth coat of color. Try Neutrogena Moistureshine Soothing Lipsheers in Fresh Rose. 3. Blot, reapply and blot again to remove excess oils and create a stain, says Bua. \"The color looks more natural and lasts longer.\" Instead of tissues, use lint-free blotting papers, like Boscia Fresh Blotting Linens ($10). Nighttime equation . 1. Exfoliate before applying a bold hue like red or burgundy. Sally Hansen Gentle Peel for Rough Lips ($10; at drugstores) uses fruit enzymes to remove dry patches. 2. Create a base with a gel-based primer that fills in fine lines around the mouth and helps lipstick go on more smoothly. One to try: Olay Regenerist lip treatment ($19; at drugstores). 3. Define the borders of your mouth with a pencil to prevent color from bleeding, says Robin Fredriksz, who gave Barrymore her deep fuchsia lip. To avoid an unnaturally dark outline, use a shade that's lighter than your lipstick, like Revlon Colorstay lip liner in Plum ($8; at drugstores). 4. Brush on color for more control. Try: Shu Uemura Kolinsky Portable Extra lipbrush ($35) with Isadora Perfect Moisture lipstick in Bordeaux Red ($11). Makeup artists' favorites . Just like us, cosmetics pros use the same lipsticks again and again. From the just right daytime rose to the classic evening red, here are some of their all-time go-to picks for day and night. Carmindy's neutral picks for day are designed to \"enhance your natural lip color.\" For night she recommends dark berry or true red for all skin tones. Her clients: Heidi Klum and Jamie-Lynn Sigler. Day shades: Benefit Silky Finish in Candy Store, $16; Givenchy Rouge Interdit in Secret Pink, $26. Night colors: Nars in Scarlet Empress, $23; Revlon Super Lustrous in Love That Red, $8; at drugstores. AJ Crimson likes a subtle pink or sheer beige for all skin tones during the day. For night he recommends bright red for fair complexions and a deep purple for darker ones. His clients: Missy Elliot and Amerie. Day shades: Chanel Rouge Hydrabase in Pink Sugar, $25; Laura Mercier in Candy Pink, ($22). Night colors: Maybelline Moisture Extreme in Royal Red, $7; at drugstores; MAC in Cyber, ($14).

Katherine Heigl has every reason to smile for our camera. A star -- and a trio of gorgeous looks -- is born. The Ing\u00e9nue: \"This is my favorite look of the three just because it's sexy but not overtly so,\" Heigl says. \"I like simple hair and makeup.\" There has been a self-tanning mishap . As Katherine Heigl crosses the parking lot of the sandwich shop at the Roosevelt Golf Course at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, she walks stiffly, holding her arms away from her like a paper doll and apologizing profusely for running 10 minutes late. Earlier, she'd sprayed her entire body with self-tanner, which refused to dry. She resorted to having her fianc\u00e9, musician Josh Kelley, take a blow-dryer to her (didn't work). So here she is, in a strapless, ankle-length Juicy Couture sundress (donned to accommodate the residual stickiness), fanning herself and wondering how mottled the tan will be when (or if) the lotion ever sets. Not that one bum experience could turn her off beauty products. \"I love everything new,\" says Heigl, 28, who, in addition to being nominated for an Emmy for best supporting actress on \"Grey's Anatomy,\" just started a production company at Fox. \"When I was in Rhode Island filming this summer, I went to Sephora for the first time. It was like my holy mecca.\" She recently had her bathroom vanity renovated with a high counter to make more room for the large drawers below that hold her well-organized loot. Then there's her deal with Coty to be the face of Nautica's new women's fragrance in January. Considering this fondness for all things beauty -- as well as Heigl's impressive acting range -- she plays TV dramedy as deftly as cinematic romantic comedy, as in the mega-hit \"Knocked Up\" and next year's 27 Dresses -- it seems natural for her to be In Style's first ever triple-cover girl. These three looks take her from girl-next-door to red-carpet knockout to pixie-coiffed vamp. The star, whom pals call Katie (and Hollywood calls the Next Big Thing), popped out her retainer to talk about makeup, breakouts and what boys like. KATHERINE HEIGL: I'm so sorry, I have to take out my Invisalign before I eat. IN STYLE: Who knew you wore them? I guess that's the point of Invisalign. KH: I got them because of this wonky tooth. I was like, OK, I can't take it. It's awesome because every two weeks you switch to a new retainer. Pretty much the perfect way to describe Invisalign is Netflix for your teeth. IS: Right -- the things we do for beauty. So, how did you like being transformed into three such different looks? KH: It was fun. I was working with such great hair and makeup people. And to have these professionals turning you into someone else is pretty neat. IS: Do you ever go without makeup? KH: There was a time when I would. Now that I get followed by photographers, I'm really paranoid about it. I do not want to be the \"Look What This Celebrity Looks Like Without Makeup\" picture. I'm clearly vain, and I don't need that. Plus, I like products. IS: How often do you go through your drawers and purge? KH: Often, because people send me a lot of stuff now, which is exciting. I love getting those boxes. [Into the tape recorder:] Send me a box of makeup, Stila! When that happens, I feel like I have to clean out and give stuff to my sister, mom and friends because there comes a point of gluttony that I can't accept. IS: How do you think you express your personality through style? KH: I'm a big hair-up person. Last night at work they put my hair in two French braids to keep it flat under the scrub cap. I thought it looked cute and that I could pull it off after I'd slept on it. And ... no. So I thought I could recreate it myself ... no again. As far as clothing style goes, I fluctuate almost as much as I do with beauty products. I like to shop for sweaters -- maybe it's the New Englander in me. I'm building a house in the mountains in Utah, so I tell myself I'm \"preparing\" for that. I like sweaters -- they're like scrubs -- you don't have to suck it in or worry about the bloat. IS: Do you know how you want your hair and makeup at your wedding? KH: I have an idea, but it's so dependent on the dress, and I haven't gotten there yet. My sister is getting married too, so we looked for dresses together. After about five stores I was like, \"I'm done.\" Everyone says, \"You just know when you put that dress on.\" My sister found the right dress just like that. So I know it can happen. But it's grueling. IS: Wait, so your mom has two daughters getting married within months? KH: My poor mother is probably like, \"Why, God? Why?\" But I hired a planner. I want the day to be spectacular, but mostly I want it to be fun. And I don't want to freak out or stress. IS: Does your fianc\u00e9 have any particular opinions about your look? KH: Josh wouldn't mind if my hair was brown, if it was still long -- that's such a boy thing. IS: Would you ever wear a wig out? KH: I'd contemplate it, but I don't know if I actually have the courage to pull it off. I once wore a long hair-extension ponytail, and someone asked me if it was real, like I was one of those dolls when we were little, and the hair just cranks out. IS: How would you describe your skin? KH: My skin is sensitive, so everything bothers it. And I'm the jerk who keeps switching products and making it worse. IS: How do you treat a breakout? KH: I got a great product at Ona Spa called Sebuspot. I've tried so many that were disappointments, but maybe I stand too close to the mirror examining my pores. If I backed up, things might look fine. IS: What do you always carry in your bag? KH: Powder, because I get shiny. And lip balm, either the Smith's Rosebud Salve or C.O. Bigelow's Mentha Lip Shine in Black Cherry Soda from Bath & Body Works. It's shiny with a little shimmer and tastes so good. IS: An In Style.com reader wants to know how you maintain a healthy body image in Hollywood. KH: I train with Harley Pasternak. I love him with my whole soul and follow his 5-Factor diet. I first said, \"I'm never going to be -- nor do I want to be -- an uber-athletic girl.\" It's just not me and I don't have that kind of discipline. He said, \"I just want you to be healthy.\" A lot of what we focus on is posture. I slump into myself when I get stressed. If I were going to play an action hero, I'd have to get that look. But I'd never maintain it. For me it's never about achieving a look that's impossible. E-mail to a friend . Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE! Copyright \u00a9 2007 Time Inc.

If the on-site \"wall of SPAM\" is any indication, a tour through the SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, is guaranteed fun for the whole canned-pork-loving family. SPAM's parent company, Hormel Foods, opened the establishment in 2001 to the tune of almost 5,000 cans of SPAM. One of the main attractions is a scale model of a SPAM plant, where visitors can don white coats and hairnets while pretending to produce America's favorite tinned meat. 2. National Museum of Funeral History . It's pretty hard to argue with the motto \"Any Day Above Ground is a Good One.\" So goes the backhanded optimism of the National Museum of Funeral History, a Houston facility that opened in 1992. Visitors are treated to exhibits that include a Civil War embalming display and a replica of a turn-of-the-century casket factory. In addition, the museum boasts an exhibit of \"fantasy coffins\" designed by Ghanaian artist Kane Quaye. These moribund masterpieces include a casket shaped like a chicken, a Mercedes-Benz, a shallot, and an outboard motor. According to Quaye, his creations are based on the dreams and last wishes of his clients, which -- let's be honest -- really makes you wonder about the guy buried in the shallot. 3. The Hobo Museum . If you're bumming around but looking for a good time, be sure to take a load off in Britt, Iowa, at The Hobo Museum, which details the history and culture of tramps. Bear in mind, though, that the museum kind of, well, slacks on hours and is only open to the public during the annual Hobo Convention. Luckily, tours can be arranged by appointment any time of year. Of course, if you're interested in the Hobo Convention, lodging is available all over the area, but it's a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the \"hobo jungle,\" located by the railroad tracks. Both the event and the museum are operated by the Hobo Foundation, which --incidentally -- also oversees the nearby Hobo Cemetery, where those who have \"caught the westbound\" are laid to rest. 4. The M\u00fctter Museum . Originally, the College of Physicians of Philadelphia erected the M\u00fctter Museum as a creative way to inform medical students and practicing physicians about some of the more unusual medical phenomena. (You know, babies with two heads, that sort of thing.) But today, it primarily serves as a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque. There, you'll find the world's largest colon, removed from a man who died -- not surprisingly -- of constipation. Also on display: an OB-GYN instrument collection, thousands of fluid-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens, and a large wall dedicated entirely to swallowed objects. 5. The Barnum Museum . What better way to honor \"Greatest Show on Earth\" founder P.T. Barnum than with a mediocre museum in Bridgeport, Connecticut? Some visitors will appreciate the museum's ridiculously detailed miniature model of a five-ring circus. But only circus freaks (and by that we mean \"enthusiasts\") will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of Barnum's 40-inch-tall sidekick, General Tom Thumb. 6. The Conspiracy Museum . There's more than one theory about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so why not have more than one museum devoted to it as well? Most JFK buffs are familiar with the Sixth Floor Museum housed in the former Texas School Book Depository, which recounts all those boring \"mainstream\" details of the late president's life leading up to his death at the hands of Lee Harvey Oswald. But just down the street, the Conspiracy Museum offers fodder for those less apt to buy into The Man's propaganda. For the most part, the museum specializes in showings of the Zapruder film and explanations of contrary assassination theories, including other gunmen on the grassy knoll and possible mafia involvement. 7. The Museum of Questionable Medical Devices . Take two trips to the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices and call us when you've lost all faith in the medical profession. Thanks to curator Bob McCoy (who recently donated the collection to the Science Museum of Minnesota), those in search of history's quack science can find what they're looking for in the St. Paul tourist attraction, whether it's a collection of 19th-century phrenology machines or some 1970s breast enlargers. If you make the trip, be sure to check out the 1930s McGregor Rejuvenator. This clever device required patrons to enclose their bodies, sans head, in a large tube where they were pounded with magnetic and radio waves in attempts to reverse the aging process. 8. Cook's Natural Science Museum . What began as a training facility for Cook's Pest Control exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the country willing to tell the tale of the pest. At Cook's Natural Science Museum in Decatur, Alabama, visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats, cockroaches, mice, spiders, and termites ... all for free. And while most people would rather step on the live specimens than learn about them, museum exhibits such as the crowd-pleasing Pest of the Month keep reeling in patrons. 9. Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum . So, what do you get when you combine the loneliness of a pet cemetery with the creepy flair of vaudeville? The Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum, of course -- where dummies go to die. The Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, museum was the brainchild of the late William Shakespeare Berger, who founded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets. In fact, he collected figures from some of the country's most famous ventriloquist acts. And with more than 700 dummies stacked from floor to ceiling, you're bound to feel like you're stuck inside a 1970s horror flick -- albeit a really good one. But sadly, when Berger gave the tour, you could totally tell his mouth was moving. 10. The Trash Museum . Mom wasn't kidding when she said one man's trash is another man's treasure. At the Trash Museum in Hartford, Connecticut, the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority (CRRA) turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment! T . our the Temple of Trash or visit the old-fashioned town dump. And for your recycler-in-training, head across the state to the Children's Garbage Museum, where you can take an educational stroll through the giant compost pile, get a glimpse of the 1-ton Trash-o-saurus, or enjoy the company of resident compost worms.

This moving image shows how police used software to unscramble the image. (Source: Interpol) The man's face was disguised by digital alteration, but the images were capable of being restored, according to a bulletin from Interpol -- the international police agency based in Lyon, France. Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said the pictures have been on the the Internet for several years, but investigators have been unable to determine the man's identity or nationality. \"We have tried all other means to identify and to bring him to justice, but we are now convinced that without the public's help this sexual predator could continue to rape and sexually abuse young children whose ages appear to range from six to early teens,\" Noble said. He said there is \"very good reason to believe that he travels the world in order to sexually abuse and exploit vulnerable children.\" Interpol has determined the photos were taken in Vietnam and Cambodia. \"The decision to make public this man's picture was not one which was taken lightly,\" said Kristin Kvigne, assistant director of Interpol's Trafficking in Human Beings Unit.

Its information is trusted and drives decision making across the globe. In October 1851 Paul Julius Reuter, a German-born immigrant, opened an office in the City of London which transmitted stock market quotations between London and Paris via the new Calais-Dover cable. 18 months earlier he had used pigeons to fly stock prices between Aachen and Brussels, a service which operated for a year until the gap in the telegraph link was closed. Reuters, as the agency soon became known, eventually extended its service to other European countries. It also expanded the content to include general and economic news from all around the world. In 1865 Reuters was first in Europe with news of President Lincoln's assassination in the United States. As overland telegraph and undersea cable facilities developed, the business expanded beyond Europe to include the Far East in 1872 and South America in 1874. In 1883 Reuters began to use a \"column printer\" to transmit messages electrically to London newspapers and in 1923 pioneered the use of radio to transmit news internationally. In 1927 it brought in the teleprinter to distribute news to London newspapers. Today Reuters has over 16,900 staff in over 94 countries across the globe, and is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, with 196 bureaux serving approximately 131 countries. In 2006 Reuters filed over two and a half million news items, including 656,500 alerts, from 209 countries around the world, published in 18 languages. Although Reuters is best known as the world's largest international multimedia news agency, more than 90% of its revenue derives from its financial services business. Some 370,000 financial market professionals working in the equities, fixed income, foreign exchange, money, commodities and energy markets around the world use Reuters products. The company supplies news -- text, graphics, video and pictures -- to media organizations across the globe. It also provides news to businesses outside the financial services sector, as well as direct to consumers.

Pruitt, the vice president for student affairs, told reporters. The seventh fatality is believed to be a Clemson University student, he said. The six survivors -- who were treated and released from Brunswick Community Hospital -- are also USC students, he said. Pruitt said the bodies were being sent to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, for identification.  Watch home video showing the house in flames \u00bb . \"It is difficult to ascertain exactly who was in the house and who was not,\" Pruitt said, explaining that several area houses were filled with college students visiting for the weekend. Newspaper deliveryman Tim Burns was aghast when he first saw the inferno early Sunday morning. He tried to approach the door but the flames were too intense, he told the Associated Press. \"When I was going up to the entryway, you could hear the windows above me explode,\" Burns said. \"When I knew the flames had taken over, I don't think I've ever felt as helpless in my life.\" The USC students were affiliated with the Delta Delta Delta sorority and the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, Pruitt said, although he stressed that the weekend was not an official Greek function. \"It just so happens, as on many university campuses, that certain sororities and certain fraternities hang around together,\" he said. One person described as \"unaccounted for\" was later confirmed dead, Ocean Isle Beach Mayor Debbie Smith told CNN. \"We suffered a terrible tragedy at Ocean Isle this morning,\" Smith said in a news conference. \"Nothing like this has ever happened at Ocean Isle Beach, and we hope it never will again.\" She said officials had not yet contacted all the victims' families, and that they were not yet releasing their names. The mayor said one of the 13 people in the house was related to the house's owner. Smith said the house was fully \"engulfed\" in flames around 7 a.m. when the fire department arrived on the scene, about five minutes after the fire department was notified. She said the house had working smoke detectors, AP reported. Officials are investigating the cause of the fire, Smith said. \"We ran down the street to get away,\" Nick Cain told the AP. The University of North Carolina student was staying at a house about 100 feet away. Some of his friends had met several people staying at the house that burned down. \"The ash and the smoke were coming down on us. We were just trying to get away,\" Cain told the AP. Ocean Isle Beach is a popular resort destination along the southern coast of North Carolina.

People line the streets, cars congest them, trash collectors and other city workers have returned, local leaders are holding community meetings again and \"markets have come back like gangbusters,\" said Army Col. Don Farris, commander of 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division. He added that the largely Sunni al Qaeda in Iraq presence has been \"crushed\" since the beginning of May. However, there are still dangers, most notably the threats posed by Iranian-backed Shiite militants, Farris said. Speaking to Pentagon reporters via video link from Baghdad, Farris cited several factors he said contributed to the improving security situation. Among them is the \"surge,\" the additional U.S. troops deployed earlier this year.  Watch how old rivalries have been posing problems \u00bb . Also helping improve the security situation are the cease-fire by radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army and the development of a program that employs \"concerned local citizens\" to assist U.S. and Iraqi forces, Farris said. Some of those citizens are members of local Sunni \"awakening councils,\" comprised of former militants -- often armed -- who create neighborhood watch groups to root out the insurgent elements in an area. Especially in the last six weeks, Farris said, civic and religious leaders have seen outsiders operating in the area and troops have made arrests, two Iranian operatives among them . \"From my foxhole, in our sector, it is working,\" he said of the improving security in the area. \"I can only speak to what I see in my sector and I am encouraged.\" Farris' sector -- which includes the Sunni-dominated district of Adhamiya and Sadr City, the Shiite slum where militants have demonstrated a strong presence -- has seen a \"remarkable turnaround,\" he said. Many of the communities in his area have been wracked with sectarian warfare and terrorized by insurgents and death squads. Despite improvements in the security situation, Farris warned that \"we still have a lot of work to do\" because there doesn't appear to be any sign that Shiite extremists with links to Iran are halting their activities. Farris said troops also are still finding explosively formed penetrators, which are often delivered or manufactured by Iran. Nine such bombs were found in late October, he said. There are intelligence reports indicating weapons and money are still flowing into Sadr City, he said. There are also problems returning refugees and displaced people to their homes in the area, Farris said, because \"essential services\" like water and electricity are not yet up to snuff. Though a \"trickle\" of families has returned home and many are asking when they can return, Farris said he believes residents will return en masse only when basic services are in better shape. Paul Folmsbee, a State Department provincial reconstruction team leader, said at the same news conference that his personnel was handling development issues involving law, governance, economic development and essential services. Farris' Monday remarks echo a string of similar assertions made by U.S. and Iraqi military officials over recent weeks. The military officials say they are seeing signs of Sunni-Shiite reconciliation. At a press conference earlier Monday in Baghdad, Brig. Gen. Ed Cardon, deputy commander for support of Multi-National Division-Center, discussed a \"definite period of progress\" in his region on the southern Baghdad outskirts.

The Santiago fire, now 27,000 acres and still burning, was deliberately set, officials said Thursday. Several mandatory evacuations remain in place for the Santiago fire, which has destroyed 14 homes and various other structures. Late Friday afternoon, the blaze moved into Silverado Canyon, authorities said. Sheriff's deputies were evacuating residents in the fire's path.  Watch the Santiago flames rage \u00bb . Authorities also suspect arson in the Rosa fire in San Diego County, which burned more than 400 acres before being fully contained. There was no information on the investigation. Elsewhere, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office filed arson charges Friday against a 41-year-old Sun Valley man who witnesses said set a fire in the West Hills neighborhood and walked away. Catalino Pineda is one of five people who have been arrested in arson investigations this week, but none of them has been linked to the major wildfires raging across Southern California. Pineda was arrested Wednesday after witnesses said they saw him lighting a fire on a hillside, police said. The fire was quickly extinguished. The witnesses followed Pineda to a nearby restaurant and called police, who arrested him. Pineda was expected to be arraigned in Van Nuys Superior Court Friday, Deputy District Attorney Steven Frankland said. He is charged with one count of arson of a structure or forest. Pineda is being held on $75,000 bail and faces up to six years in prison if convicted. In San Bernardino, east of Los Angeles, John Rund, of Hesperia, was arrested Wednesday on arson charges after a witness reported seeing him in brush near the starting point of a fire Tuesday, the sheriff's department said. That fire was quickly put out by passers-by. Investigators are trying to determine if Rund, 48, may have ties to other wildfires. He is being held on $750,000 bail. The San Bernardino County District Attorney's Office on Thursday filed arson charges against Anthony Riperti, 47, of Redlands. A statement from the office did not say when or where Riperti is accused of setting a fire. He is being held on $250,000 bail. In San Diego County, the sheriff's department this week arrested an adult and a juvenile allegedly seen by an anonymous tipster starting a fire in Vista in the northern part of the county. In a written statement, the sheriff's department identified the adult as Gorgonio Nava. The Vista fire Department extinguished the blaze before it grew out of control, the statement said. Investigators have determined that the Grass Valley fire in San Bernardino County was not caused by arson, and a preliminary investigation into the cause of the 11,675-acre Slide fire seems to indicate arson was not a factor, sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Beaver said. More than 1,600 homes have been destroyed in the past week by Southern California wildfires.

Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, is being sought as a suspect, police say. \"We have found the child, Madison. She's safe. The detectives say she is in good condition,\" Nye County Sheriff Tony De Meo said. The girl, now 7, was shown in a sex video made four years ago, Detective David Boruchowitz said at a news conference Friday night. She was found Friday with family in Las Vegas after thousands of tips poured in, thanks to an appeal by police to the news media to show the girl's picture. CNN and other news organizations did so until the child was found, when De Meo asked them to stop showing the picture. \"The mother has cooperated with us,\" De Meo said. \"We believe that the mother was not aware of anything that went on with this young girl,\" he said. \"It was very sad for her to find this out.\" A former Las Vegas animal trainer, Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, has been identified as a suspect and is being sought in the case, De Meo said. Pahrump is about 60 miles west of Las Vegas.  Watch what's known about Stiles \u00bb . Stiles was a distant friend of the girl's family, De Meo said. Someone close to Stiles has told investigators that Stiles is a \"survivalist type\" and always carries a weapon, Nye County District Attorney Bob Beckett said. De Meo addressed Stiles directly: \"Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency,\" he said. \"Understand this: Law enforcement not only has a long arm, but a long memory. You will not be forgotten by members of this agency or any other law enforcement agency.\"   The FBI is also seeking Stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 in a separate matter, De Meo said. Police, who had called Stiles a person of interest, began calling him a suspect late Friday. There appeared to be physical similarities between Stiles and the man in the videotape, De Meo said. \"Nothing that I have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through. Whoever this person is is a predator that, as far as I'm concerned, belongs in custody and, if successfully prosecuted, in jail for as long as the law allows,\"  De Meo said earlier.  Detectives said the child showed little emotion during the rapes, indicating she may have been brutalized before. Nevadan Darren Tuck recently gave police the videotape, saying he found it in the desert, De Meo said. Police said the tape was in his possession at least since May before he handed it over to authorities. He is being sought on a parole violation for failure to pay child support, but police -- who want to question him further -- have been unable to locate him. Tuck, who also allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces a possible 10-years-to-life sentence for exhibiting pornography and another one to six years for possession of child pornography, De Meo said. Harry Kuehn, Tuck's attorney, said this week on CNN's \"Nancy Grace\" that Tuck was \"racked by indecision\" about what to do with the tape once he realized what it was. Asked why, Kuehn said, \"He's explained that to us, and at this point, we're not going to share that, because it goes to the defense of the matter.\" \"You have to consider what kind of concerns my client had; He's previously dealt with the sheriff's office in Nye County; it was previously unsatisfactory,\" the attorney said.

Long before the Material Girl ordered papa to stop preaching, these six puffed-up virtuosos knew darn well how to strike a pose. Alfred Hitchcock didn't leave people in suspense about how he felt about actors. Here's to the creative types who managed to raise egotism to an art form. Alfred Hitchcock . Hitchcock was, without question, one of the towering geniuses of cinema. And, like many greats, he wasn't exactly the best collaborator. Hitchcock was particularly trying for screenwriters, who felt he never properly credited them for their work. But he was notoriously hard on actors. He was once quoted as saying, \"Actors are cattle\" -- a quip that stirred up a huge outcry (actors can be so touchy). In response, he issued this correction: \"I have been misquoted. What I really said is, 'Actors should be treated as cattle.'\" Although it began accidentally (when he was short an actor for the film \"The Lodger\"), Hitchcock soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films, amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career. Ayn Rand . The egotist's egotist, author Ayn Rand (born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum) is the patron saint of Thinking You're Better Than Everybody Else. Her most famous novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, are massive dramatizations of Objectivism, her self-spun Oscar-the-Grouch philosophy for success. Objectivism champions ego and accomplishment, shuns all religion as folly, and condemns any form of charity or altruism as counterproductive to society. Rand's novels often focus on protagonists (invariably men) who are shunned by others because of their genius, but then persevere over the foolishness of morons to prove said genius and emerge triumphant. Not surprisingly, she saw humility as a weakness and regarded laughing at yourself as \"spitting in your own face.\" So, just how much did Rand believe in her own philosophy? Let's just say a lot. With signature modesty, she ranked herself as the philosophical equal of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. Orson Welles . When you create a cinematic masterpiece such as \"Citizen Kane\" at the ripe old age of 25, you're bound to get a big head. But Welles was convinced of his own importance much earlier than that. In fact, \"Citizen Kane\" might have been sparked by nothing more than a bruised ego. After all, it's said he devised the film as a withering expos\u00e9 of newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst because Hearst slighted Welles at a dinner party. Of course, after the unparalleled success of \"Citizen Kane,\" Welles's arrogant side didn't get any less subtle. Do yourself a favor: Track down a recording of Welles' outtakes for a TV commercial for frozen peas. You'll hear everything you need to know about the filmmaker's oversized ego. A classic quote goes: \"In the depths of your ignorance, what is it you want?\" Frank Lloyd Wright . As the brains behind the Robie House, Fallingwater, Taliesin West, the Guggenheim, and countless other design benchmarks, Frank Lloyd Wright is arguably the genius of 20th-century architecture. And, boy, did he know it! Wright was notorious for believing he was superior to mere mortals. In fact, the architectural egomaniac frequently acted as though the rules -- even those of geography and climate -- did not apply to him. But when you're Wright, you're right. In 1935, department store magnate Stanley Marcus (of Neiman-Marcus fame) commissioned the architect to design his Dallas home, but the project quickly went sour. Wright's avant-garde floor plan included \"sleeping porches\" that required his client to sleep outdoors year-round. In addition, Marcus' small bedroom \"cubicles\" came equipped with almost no closet space. When Stanley respectfully explained that (a) temperatures during summer nights in Dallas often exceed 80 degrees and (b) a high-fashion tastemaker might need bigger closets, Wright threw a series of tantrums. Fortunately for the voyeur in us all, said tantrums usually took place in letter form. Preserved and occasionally displayed at the Dallas Museum of Art, they make for delicious reading. Salvador Dal\u00ed . \"Every morning when I awake, the greatest of joys is mine: that of being Salvador Dal\u00ed.\" Yup, he actually said that. Everything about the legendary Surrealist painter (he of the melting clocks) -- from his whacked-out paintings to his curled-up mustache -- was designed to shock, destroy convention, cause scandal, and stir controversy. Criticized for choosing to live under General Franco's fascist government in Spain, Dal\u00ed defended his position by stating that he didn't care about others so long as he could be king. Not exactly a man of the people. If he wasn't getting enough attention, he was known to walk the streets of New York City clanging a hand bell. Of course, this is also the guy who once said, \"The thought of not being recognized [is] unbearable.\" Need another telling quote? \"At the age of 6 years, I wanted to be a chef. At the age of 7, I wanted to be Napoleon. My ambitions have continued to grow at the same rate ever since.\" Apparently, so did his ego. Al Jolson . Plenty of performers this side of Gallagher have been labeled \"the world's greatest entertainer.\" But Al Jolson really, really believed it. The vaudeville singer, actor, dancer, and comedian was born Asa Yoelson in Seredzius, Lithuania, in what was then part of Imperial Russia. As a performer, he was known for hijacking the action in the middle of shows, ad-libbing, or just stopping to talk to the audience. During a 1911 performance of the critically hated \"Paris is a Paradise for Coons\" (title not edited for political correctness), Jolson stopped and asked the audience if they'd rather hear him sing than see the rest of the play. The crowd roared with applause, and Jolson ditched the whole program and took over. From that moment on, no one else could share the stage with him. Unlike some of the egomaniacs on this list, however, Jolson can be forgiven somewhat for his arrogance. According to most contemporary accounts, he actually was the greatest in the world. But, despite the enormity of his contributions to stage and screen, Jolson's legacy has become a political hot potato because of his use of stage blackface (considered highly offensive now, but pretty common at the time).

Chip Auman said his 18-year-old daughter survived the fire but was hospitalized and in stable condition because of complications from smoke inhalation. \"The thought of losing a child is unimaginable to me, and as a father my heart goes out to the families that lost a loved one in this situation,\" he said. Auman said the situation was \"hard to fathom.\" \"There's just no words to describe what we've been going through,\" he said, asking for prayers for survivors and the families of those who died. \"We're numb, we're confused, we're heartbroken.\" Two college campuses mourned Monday. Six University of South Carolina students and a Clemson University student died in the fire early Sunday morning in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina. Six other South Carolina students were able to get out of the house in time. The six were treated and released from nearby Brunswick Community Hospital, but Auman's daughter was hospitalized again in Hartsville, South Carolina. Authorities from the state Bureau of Investigation and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are leading the investigation into the cause of the fire. Ocean Isle Beach Mayor Debbie Smith said the house was \"engulfed\" in flames when the fire department arrived on the scene, about five minutes after being notified. The flames shot into the sky and ultimately left little more than portions of the framing. Fire officials do not believe foul play was involved.

It could be as much as a month until investigators know the cause of the fire, Pruitt said. The university did not cancel classes on Monday, but Pruitt said arrangements had been made for those who need to go home or stay out of class at the 28,000-student campus. Pruitt said meetings had been held Sunday with members of Delta Delta Delta sorority and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. The South Carolina students were affiliated with those houses, he said, although he stressed that the weekend was not an official Greek function. He also said counselors and ministers were available to help students deal with the loss of their classmates. The university president, Dr. Andrew Sorenson, contacted the families of those who died in the fire to express the condolences and support of the university community. Jay Laura, student president of the USC chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said the campus would pull together after the tragedy. \"If any place can come together to help in the healing process and the aftermath of an event like this, it is South Carolina,\" Laura said at a Monday afternoon press conference. Fire survivor Tripp Wylie, a 20-year-old South Carolina sophomore, said he jumped out of a third-story window into a canal to escape the flames and was unable to get back in to help his friends. \"I could see a buddy of mine off to the left who had gotten out. He was just yelling at me to jump and stuff,\" Wylie told CNN affiliate WYFF. \"The smoke was pouring out, couldn't really breathe, so I had to make a quick decision.

Jonathan Evans, the chief of MI5, also said that at least 2,000 people in Britain pose a threat to the country's security because of their support for al Qaeda-inspired terrorism. \"As I speak, terrorists are methodically and intentionally targeting young people and children in this country. They are radicalising, indoctrinating and grooming young, vulnerable people to carry out acts of terrorism,\" he told a gathering of newspaper editors in Manchester. Evans said the figure of 2,000 -- an increase of 400 since November 2006 -- only included those the intelligence services knew about and that the actual number could be double. He said there had been 200 terrorist convictions in Britain since the September 11 attacks. The MI5 head added that over recent years much of the command and inspiration for attack planning in the UK had come from al Qaeda's remaining core leadership in the tribal areas of Pakistan. However, he said in the last 12 months terrorist plots on British soil were increasingly inspired by al Qaeda cadres in other countries, including in Iraq and East Africa. \"There is no doubt now that al Qaeda in Iraq aspires to promote terrorist attacks outside Iraq. There is no doubt that there is training activity and terrorist planning in East Africa -- particularly in Somalia -- which is focused on the UK,\" he told the Society of Editors meeting. According to Evans, there had been \"no decrease\" in the number of Russian covert intelligence officers operating in Britain since the end of the Cold War. He said that resources that could be devoted to counter-terrorism were instead being used to protect Britain against spying by Russia, China and others. \"A number of countries continue to devote considerable time and energy trying to steal our sensitive technology on civilian and military projects and trying to obtain political and economic intelligence at our expense,\" he said.

Ruben Navarrette Jr.: Some opponents of immigration, even the legal kind, fear changes in local culture. Immigration restrictionists -- and by that, I mean those who want to limit all immigration, even the legal kind -- like to pretend they're so high-minded. Yet they can't help themselves. They always take the low road and harken back to the nativism that greeted earlier waves of immigrants. The restrictionists insist that what bothers them are merely practical concerns: that our borders aren't secure, that so many immigrants are coming into the country illegally, and that the new arrivals are burdening schools and draining social services once they get here. Really? If that's the extent of it, then why does the conversation quickly turn to the impact -- both real and perceived -- that immigrants have on American culture through everything from taco trucks to Spanish-language billboards. That seems to be the issue in North Dakota, where, according to a recent article in USA Today, towns facing tough economic times are nonetheless resisting a cultural transfusion that could save them. In Cooperstown, the locals opposed efforts to bring in a hog plant and a dairy, because those kind of dirty and hard jobs are likely to attract ... guess who? American kids who work at Starbucks? Nope. The article quotes Orville Tranby, a local community leader in Cooperstown, who says that some residents have told him \"face to face\" that such facilities might attract Hispanic immigrants who could change the local culture. You'll find the same fear in Lewisburg, Tennessee. Not long ago, an employee at a local library came up with the radical idea of a bilingual story time where children could hear tales read to them in Spanish. Townspeople wanted no part of that. They demanded that all books purchased by the library, or even donated, be in English-only. These stories are ridiculous, but they're also helpful. They illustrate what some people are really concerned about with immigration, and it goes well beyond words like \"legal\" or \"illegal.\" It's the perception that the country is becoming more Hispanic, that Spanish is replacing English, that Hispanic immigrants are weakening American identity, and that Main Street is turning into Little Mexico. A leader of the vigilante Minuteman movement moronically called it the \"colonization\" of the United States. This sort of rhetoric is all about fear -- that those who thrive in the dominant culture are losing their primacy, that the mainstream is being polluted by foreigners, and that our children are going to live in a world where they're going to have to work a lot harder to keep up. It conjures up the alarm bells that Benjamin Franklin set off about German immigrants in the late 18th century, who he insisted could never adopt the culture of the English, but would \"swarm into our Settlements, and by herding together establish their Language and Manners to the Exclusion of ours.\" It popped up in the mid-19th century amid worries that Chinese immigrants were \"unassimilable,\" which led to Congress approving the explicitly-named Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. And it helped welcome the 20th century when Massachusetts Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge warned that immigrants (read: the Irish) were diluting \"the quality of (U.S.) citizenship\" and others complained that Italian immigrants were uneducated, low skilled, apt to send all their money to their home country and prone to criminal activity. Where have we heard that before? And when will we hear it again? After all, Hispanics may be the latest group to find themselves in a culture war with nativists. But they won't be the last.

Julio Cruz is mobbed by team-mates after giving Inter the lead in their 1-1 draw at Juventus. Camoranesi picked up a headed knock-down from substitute Vincenzo Iaquinta before seeing his shot deflect off defender  Walter Samuel to leave goalkeeper Julio Cesar helpless. Inter took a first-half lead when Argentine striker Julio Cruz broke Juve's offside trap and latched onto Brazilian midfielder Cesar's through ball before firing past Gianluigi Buffon. The result means Inter retain their unbeaten record this season, despite injury problems that saw the likes of Patrick Vieira, Francesco Toldo, Marco Materazzi and Dejan Stankovic ruled out. The defending champions are now two points clear of Fiorentina at the top of the table, with Roma a point further behind and Juventus in fourth place. Earlier in the day, Roma missed out on the chance to close the gap on Inter when a late collapse saw them throw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at Empoli. First half goals from French winger Ludovic Giuly and Matteo Brighi had put the visiting Romans in charge and for more than an hour they looked set to cruise to victory. But with 23 minutes remaining Ighli Vannucchi reduced the deficit and Sebastian Giovinco snatched an injury time equaliser to deny Luciano Spaletti's injury-depleted team.

An image from a video posted on YouTube by \"Sturmgeist89.\" The shooting appeared to have been planned out in graphic videos posted on Internet file-sharing site YouTube. At a news conference this afternoon, police confirmed the dead numbered two girls, five boys and the school's headmistress at Jokela High in Tuusula, a quiet town around 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Helsinki. Ten other people were taken to a hospital with minor injuries. The shooter, whom police identified as Pekka Eric Auvinen, died at Toolo Hospital, authorities said. Police said he took his own life. It was the first school shooting in Finland since 1989, when a 14-year-old student shot and killed two others in the coastal town of Rauma, the Finnish news agency STT reported. Police said Auvinen is from Tuusula and who acted alone. He had no previous criminal record and had never threatened anyone from the school before, they added. Auvinen published a manifesto online demanding war on the \"weak-minded masses\" and pledged to die for his cause.  Watch Auvinen fire weapons in video from his Web page \u00bb . YouTube appeared to have removed 89 videos linked to his account, many of them featuring Nazi imagery, shortly after the incident. Finnish media reported someone posted a message two weeks ago on the Web site, warning of a bloodbath at the school. A video posted earlier Wednesday, by \"Sturmgeist89,\" was titled \"Jokela High School Massacre - 11/7/2007.\" \"Sturmgeist89\" identified himself as Auvinen, and said he chose the name \"Sturmgeist\" because it means \"storm spirit\" in German. The video showed a picture of the school, which then disintegrated to reveal two images of Auvinen against a red background, pointing a gun at the screen. The clip is accompanied by the song \"Stray Bullet\" from rock band KMFDM. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the students behind the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, also cited that group's lyrics. Another short video clip, called \"Just Testing My Gun,\" showed Auvinen loading and cocking a handgun. He fired and hit several pieces of fruit in a wooded area; the camera then showed a close-up of the destroyed fruit, and then a full-screen shot of him again. He waved at the camera and then walked out of view. The site indicated that the youth appeared to be fascinated with killing. As well as video footage of the Columbine school shootings, it also included clips of the 1993 Waco siege in the United States, the 1995 sarin gas attack in Tokyo, and bombs falling on Baghdad during the 2003 invasion. Many showed victims being wheeled away or people running for their lives. Throughout all of this, the single word \"DIE\" constantly flashed across the screen. Other video clips included Nazi-war-criminal footage. In the rambling text posted on the site, Auvinen said that he is \"a cynical existentialist, anti-human humanist, anti-social social-Darwinist, realistic idealist and god-like atheist. \"I am prepared to fight and die for my cause,\" he wrote. \"I, as a natural selector, will eliminate all who I see unfit, disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection.\" The police said at this afternoon's press conference that they had been fired at when they arrived at the school at 11.45 p.m. local time (9.45 a.m. GMT). They described the scene as chaotic, with some of the 460 students, ranging in age from 12 to 18, breaking windows in an attempt to escape. When the police's special SWAT unit entered the high school they found the gunman unconscious and in critical condition in the lower lobby of the building with a gunshot wound to his head. Police assume he tried to take his own life as no officers fired at him.  Several bodies were also found in the same location, where the shooting is believed to have begun, they added. They could not confirm comments by some students that Auvinen was firing through doors. Police also said that the gun Auvinen used, which was fully licensed, had been purchased less than a month ago on October 19. The legal age limit to own a gun in Finland is 18, which Auvinen passed in June of this year. He had a recommendation from a shooting club when he obtained the gun, police added, and practised sharp-shooting as a hobby at a shooting range. Finland, which enjoys a strong tradition of hunting, has a high proportion of gun ownership, with two million firearms owned in a nation of only five million. The Associated Press reported comments from Kim Kiuru, one of the school's teachers, on radio station YLE. Kiuru described how the headmistress used the public address system around noon to tell pupils to stay in classrooms. He said he locked his classroom door, then waited in the corridor for more news. \"After that I saw the gunman running with what appeared to be a small-caliber handgun in his hand through the doors towards me, after which I escaped to the corridor downstairs and ran in the opposite direction, \" Kiuru said. The agency reported Kiuru as saying that he saw a woman's body as he fled the school, before telling his pupils to leave the building through the windows.  E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 CNN.

Sect leader Warren Jeffs arrives in court to hear the verdict against him September 25 in St. George, Utah. Jeffs, the leader and so-called prophet of the 10,000-member Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is now awaiting sentencing after being convicted on two counts of being an accomplice to rape. The documents, released by Fifth District Judge James Shumate at the request of the media, also indicate that Jeffs confessed to \"immorality\" with a \"sister\" and a daughter more than 30 years ago. Among the documents is a competency report on Jeffs completed in April, in which social worker Eric Nielsen wrote that throughout the month of January, Jeffs refused food and drink and developed ulcers on his knees from kneeling in prayer for hours. On January 28, the report said, he attempted to hang himself in his cell. In the days following the suicide attempt, while he was on suicide watch, Jeffs on separate occasions threw himself against the wall and banged his head on the wall. Jail transcripts show that Jeffs' suicide attempt came three days after a visit with his brother, Nephi, in which he said, \"I am not the prophet. I never was the prophet, and I have been deceived by the powers of evil ... I ask for everyone's forgiveness.\" Jeffs also told his brother: \"Farewell forever.\" The day before that, Jeffs told a follower in a phone conversation that he was \"covered with immorality with a sister and a daughter when I was younger.\" In the FLDS, members call adult women \"sister,\" and Jeffs' meaning was unclear. Jeffs' defense attorneys, who argued against the release of the documents, said in a motion opposing the unsealing of the statements that Jeffs recanted them the following month. Defense attorneys claim Jeffs' medical condition influenced his state of mind when the statements were made. They presented Shumate with a letter from another Jeffs attorney, arguing that the statements' release could influence an Arizona jury when Jeffs stands trial in that state. Jeffs, 51, was convicted in September of being an accomplice to rape. He was accused of using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marriage to her 19-year-old cousin. He faces a sentence of up to life in prison when he is sentenced November 20. The FLDS -- which is not affiliated with the mainstream Mormon church -- is based in the side-by-side border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. Jeffs, a former school headmaster, is the son of the sect's previous president and \"prophet,\" Rulon Jeffs, who died in 2002. Jeffs was on the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives list when he was arrested in August 2006 outside Las Vegas, Nevada. Critics say that inside the FLDS, marriages are arranged for girls as young as 13, and competition for brides may be reduced by exiling male teens and young men. If male followers are excommunicated, critics claim, wives and children can be reassigned. During Jeffs' trial, defense attorneys claimed authorities were persecuting Jeffs because of his religious beliefs, including practicing polygamy as the way to heaven. If Jeffs disavowed being the prophet of the FLDS, it could cause upheaval within the secretive sect. However, two of his followers who spoke to CNN -- although FLDS members usually do not talk to reporters -- said they do not believe he made the statements. \"He is a perfectly priestly man,\" said a woman who identified herself as Cathy. \"He is a man of God, and we will always love him. Once a prophet, always a prophet.\" Her husband, Patrick, told CNN, \"It's hogwash. I don't believe it ... I will always consider him my prophet.\" E-mail to a friend .

A disconsolate Lewis Hamilton leaves his car after spinning into the gravel trap in Shanghai. Rookie Hamilton can still clinch the crown with third place in the closing race, but saw his 12-point lead cut to four by McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso in Shanghai. The Spaniard finished second behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, who also kept his title hopes alive by moving within seven points of Hamilton. The young Briton started the race in pole position and at one stage led Raikkonen by more than eight seconds as he again showed superb skills in the wet conditions. However, the 22-year-old stayed out on the drying track too long in his wet tires, which deteriorated at an alarming rate to let Finland's Raikkonen take the lead. And when Hamilton -- who won in Japan last week to give himself the chance of clinching the title this weekend -- finally headed toward the pit lane, he spun out onto the gravel to end his chances with 25 laps to go. Raikkonen and Alonso both switched to dry tires on the 32nd of the 56 laps, with the Finn going on to win by by 9.8 seconds for his fifth victory this season -- one more than both Hamilton and Alonso. Raikkone's team-mate Felipe Massa was third, while fourth place was claimed by Toro Rosso's Sebastien Vettel, who was last week reprimanded for causing an accident in Japan behind the safety car while Hamilton was cleared of any wrongdoing. Britain's Jenson Button was fifth in a Honda ahead of Vettel's team-mate Vitantonio Liuzzi, while Germany's Nick Heidfeld was seventh for BMW Sauber and David Coulthard of Scotland took the final point for Red Bull. Hamilton was still confident he could bounce back after suffering his first retirement of the season. \"I'm sorry for the team but I can still do it, don't worry,\" he said. \"When I got out of the car I was just gutted because it was my first mistake all year, and to do it on the way into the pits was not something I usually do. \"You cannot go through life without making mistakes. But I am over it and we look forward to Brazil. The team will be working hard to make sure the car is quick enough there, and we still have points in the bag. \"We were having a great race and we didn't know if it was going to rain or not. The tyres were getting worse and worse and you could almost see the canvas underneath. When I came into the pits it was like ice, I couldn't do anything about it.\" McLaren boss Ron Dennis refused to blame his driver or his team for the spin-off. \"It's too extreme to say anyone made a mistake in this. It has been a very competitive season between our drivers and it will go on for another Grand Prix,\" Dennis said. \"I don't think we did anything dramatically wrong and neither did Lewis. But the circuit was considerably drier than the pit lane entrance. That's what made the difference. \"It was easy to say that we could have stopped earlier, but would it have made a difference?

Sheikh Mohammed is concerned the nuclear dispute with Iran  is deterring potential investors . As chief executive of the Economic Development Board, one of Sheikh Mohammed's main tasks is to ensure Bahrain stays ahead of its competitors. The government's pushing ahead with economic reforms to reduce the Kingdom's dependence on oil. But with crude prices near $100 a barrel, John Defterios asked whether the appetite for change had diminished. SM: The reforms are being done for aspirational reasons rather than necessity, so we are trying to enter the post-oil area because we want to. And therefore, because of this aspirational aspect, trying to get to as opposed to people pushing us somewhere we don't want to go. JD: How do you redefine Bahrain's role? Traditionally it's been a financial center, but you have Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Dubai even Abu Dhabi emerging in financial services. How you redefine it to sustain a lead? SM: The rising tide lifts a lot of places and as the region is booming and growing, financial services are growing throughout the region. Bahrain's strengths have been and will continue to be its human capital, the people that have led the financial sector and the long standing regulations that have been established in Bahrain. JD: Strategically and a geopolitical question here: the Crown Prince came out and declared what Iran's intentions really are -- in his view -- for a nuclear policy, and called for greater diplomacy right ahead of a visit by the President of Iran to the country. What's the motivation here? SM: We feel that the distraction caused by the Iranian nuclear issue is holding investment back in the region as a whole, and increasing the security threat of the region. Nobody is debating the right to peaceful nuclear power, but we all have that need and we all need a peaceful resolution to this. JD: Historically, Iran has even made claims against Bahrain, what do you do now moving forward now? Do you bring Russia, China, the United States and the European Union closer together, in terms of where we should be going in the future? SM: We've resolved our historical issue with Iran, and we are well beyond that, but going forward... This is such a important issue affecting security worldwide, that we feel it is important and at a level high enough that we need all powers involved because it does affect everybody. JD: Can the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) become much tighter as an organization to have a voice in that process; as opposed to speaking from the sidelines and hoping that the major powers move forward? SM: Absolutely, I mean, the GCC is speaking with a unified voice. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia came out with a proposal for providing nuclear fuel from an independent authority; this was completely backed from the GCC. We are all moving forward and are willing to play a beneficial role to resolve this issue. Meet the Sheikh: . Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa is chief executive of the Economic Development Board, the organization responsible for stimulating and supporting growth of the Bahraini economy. He was appointed in June 2005, following 10 years working directly for His Highness Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Crown Prince, Commander-in-Chief of the Bahrain Defense Force and Chairman of the Economic Development Board. From 1995 to 1999, he was director of the Crown Prince's office. In 1999, he was appointed head of the court and also deputy head of the Crown Prince's International Scholarship Program. During this time, Sheikh Mohammed was heavily involved with the Crown Prince's initiatives to liberalize the telecommunications sector and with labor market and economic reforms. A keen motor sports enthusiast, Sheikh Mohammed was deputy board chairman of the Bahrain International Circuit and is a former vice president of the Bahrain Motor Club, now known as the Bahrain Motor Federation. Sheikh Mohammed, who is married with two sons and one daughter, was born on April 14, 1969. In 1992, he received a bachelor's degree in economic theory from the American University, Washington DC. Two years later, he received a post-graduate diploma in business studies from the London School of Economics.

Rescuers and bomb experts search for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building. It was one of two suspected car bombs that struck Algiers within 10 minutes of each other. The death toll is unclear: the official government count is at least 26, but hospital sources in Algiers told CNN affiliate BFM-TV that 76 people were killed in the two blasts. A statement from the United Nations said 45 people were reported killed. Algerian Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni blamed a militant Islamic group with ties to al Qaeda for the attacks, which also targeted a building housing Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court. In a posting on an Islamist Web site, the group al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility. CNN could not immediately corroborate that claim, but the Web site is known to carry messages, claims and videos from al Qaeda and other militant groups. In the posting, the bombers were identified as Sheikh Ibrahim Abu Othman and Abdel Rahman Abu Abdel Nasser al-Asimi. It said two trucks were filled with \"no less than 800 kg (1,763 pounds) of explosives.\" The group called the operation \"another successful conquest and a second epic that the knights of faith have dictated with their blood, defending the wounded Islamic nation and in defiance to the Crusaders and their agents, the slaves of America and the sons of France.\" At least 10 U.N. staffers were among those killed, according to U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe. The offices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees -- located across the street from the U.N. headquarters -- were leveled by a blast that struck about 9:30 a.m. (3:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday. \"Our offices are basically destroyed now, nothing works,\" UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said from its Geneva headquarters. Watch his full interview . He said rescuers are working into the night trying to get to the trapped U.N. workers. \"It's a very serious situation still with the U.N. in Algiers,\" he said. In a strongly worded statement, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned what he called \"an abjectly cowardly strike against civilian officials serving humanity's highest ideals under the U.N. banner.\" \"The perpetrators of these crimes will not escape the strongest possible condemnation -- and ultimate punishment -- by Algerian authorities and the international community,\" Ban said in the written statement. He said he has sent senior advisers and other top U.N. officials to head to Algiers to assist in the investigation and rescue effort. Most of those killed in the coordinated attacks were victims of the first suspected car bombing near the Constitutional Council -- which oversees elections -- and Supreme Court in the Algiers neighborhood of Ben Aknoun, according to the state-run Algeria Press Agency. That blast struck a bus outside the targeted building, killing many of those on board, the news agency reported. One man said he heard the first blast then the second exploded in front of him. \"I saw the trees falling and the glass shattering in front of me. I had to run away from the car,\" he said. Zerhouni said the attack was the work of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), the same group that took responsibility for an attack in April in downtown Algiers that killed 33 people. That group also uses the name al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb after merging with al Qaeda earlier this year. It abandoned small-scale attacks in favor of headline-grabbing blasts after it joined with al Qaeda. CNN International Security Correspondent Paula Newton said the merger combined the expertise of Algerian guerrillas with the operational ability of al Qaeda in North Africa, enabling the group to penetrate the usually extensive security in high-profile areas of Algiers. She said the group's goal is to destabilize countries like Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, which it sees as enemies of the Islamic state. Zerhouni said police interrogations of GSPC members arrested in the wake of the April attack revealed that Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court were on a list of GSPC targets. Algeria, which has a population of 33 million, is still recovering from more than a decade of violence that began after the military government called a halt to elections which an Islamist party was poised to win. Tens of thousands of people died in the unrest. Although the country has remained relatively peaceful, recent terrorist attacks have raised fears of a slide back to violence.

Messi (left) is congratulated by Ronaldinho after scoring again in Barcelona's 3-0 win over Atletico Madrid. Barcelona had thumped Atletico 6-0 on their own ground last season and the visitors were out for revenge -- but conceded twice in four minutes. After 15 minutes, Italian goalkeeper Christian Abbiati let a routine Messi cross slip out of his hands and Deco rolled home into the empty net. Four minutes later Messi played a great one-two with Ronaldinho and rifled a shot past Abbiati for his sixth goal of the season and Xavi added a third late on. \"It was a deserved victory against a rival that we have had problems with in the past,\" explained Barca coach Frank Rijkaard. \"We scored twice in quick succession and then we controlled the match using aggression and with the team attacking and defending as a unit.\" \"Conceding two early goals inside four minutes is not easy to turn around especially against Barcelona,\" admitted Atletico coach Javier Aguirre. It was Barcelona's fourth straight league win but they still trail Real Madrid by two points after the champions beat Recreativo Huleva 2-0. Dutch international Ruud van Nistelrooy, the league's top-scorer last season, scored on 72 minutes before Gonzalo Higuain netted in the final minute to keep Real at the summit. Luck deserted them when Wesley Sneijder hit the post but Van Nistelrooy scored in the final quarter hour before Higuain struck to keep them two points clear at the top.

Then there are the newer circuits -- Malaysia and Bahrain, for instance -- but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins. Fuji Speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view. Next week they have something completely new to contend with: a track that has yet to see a single F1 team put in a single lap. The Japan Grand Prix is to return to the Fuji Speedway, a circuit that hasn't seen an F1 race since 1977 (though now with a substantially different track layout). The Fuji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games. The old Fuji Speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game Pole Position (released by Namco in Japan and Atari in the rest of the world). The most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest mountain, looming in the distance. Though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies. The Suzuka track -- which had held Japanese Grands Prix between 1987 and 2006 -- had been popular with drivers and fans alike, but for this year and the next the Japanese Grand Prix will be held at Fuji. However an announcement by Formula One Management (FOM) this month revealed that Suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009 -- on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications -- with the location of the Japanese Grand Prix alternating yearly between Fuji and Suzuka after that. Behind the scenes is a political battleground -- both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with F1 connections -- Honda owns Suzuka, Toyota owns Fuji. Toyota is a relative newcomer to F1 but, having this year surpassed General Motors as the world's number one automobile manufacturer, and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock (a position that hasn't been reflected in sporting success), it is not without clout. The redesign of the Fuji track was carried out by Hermann Tilke in 2003. Tilke, a German architect redesigned a number of F1 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including Malaysia, Istanbul, Bahrain and Shanghai, and the tracks for 2008's debut grands prix in Singapore and Valencia. So how do F1 teams prepare for a new circuit such as Fuji without data from previous races to fall back on? The answer lies with computer simulation. Computer-aided design (CAD) is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the high-tech cars. Every bend, every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself. Despite never having raced on the circuit, the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual Fuji Speedway for some time. BMW Sauber's simulation experts received CAD data from the Japanese race organizers late last year. And when their cars arrive at Fuji for testing next week, their race set-up should be close to optimum. The circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments. The radius of each individual segment was measured, allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line (the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance). Then the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated. The slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car. \"In order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend, we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels, gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance,\" says Willy Rampf, Technical Director of the BMW Sauber F1 Team. Dieter Glass, Chief Race and Test Engineer with Toyota F1 explains: . \"You start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit. Once you know that, you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce, before you get into more detailed simulations of different set-up solutions. \"Getting a bit closer to the weekend, you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy. This prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track, like the degradation of the two Bridgestone tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time. If you have more fuel in the car, this affects your lap time, but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried.\" One peculiarity of the Fuji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight, which at 1.475 km (0.916 miles) will allow for higher-than average-straight line speeds but, after the straight the track is relatively twisty. The teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight, and the best grip decelerating into the bends. \"You have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip,\" says Glass, \"and as always you want good grip in general, but you have to balance that with the long straight, where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed.\" The testing may be virtual, but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hair's breadth away from real world eventualities: . \"Our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values,\" says Rampf. Not that everything can be predicted: \"I think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race,\" continues Glass. \"Many incidents can happen, which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy.\" E-mail to a friend .", "a0a84718168357049273f6e65133fd06e67cd6d2": "NYON, Switzerland -- Celtic have been fined $50,800 by UEFA and AC Milan's Dida has been banned for two matches after the incident which saw a pitch-invading supporter approach the Brazilian goalkeeper in last week's Champions League match at Celtic Park. Dida's theatrical over-reaction has resulted in UEFA suspending him for two matches. The incident occurred when the Scottish side beat Milan 2-1 in Glasgow. A fan ran onto the field in the 90th minute, soon after the home side scored their winning goal, and made what appeared to be minimal contact with Dida. The Milan goalkeeper turned to chase the supporter before dropping to the ground. He was carried off the field on a stretcher and replaced. Dida's theatrical over-reaction has cost him severely -- but Celtic may choose not to complain about their own punishment, with half of their fine suspended for two years. UEFA did have the power to change the result of the match, although that was always unlikely. UEFA's control and disciplinary body found Celtic guilty of charges of \"lack of organisation and improper conduct of supporters\", while Dida was found to have breached UEFA's \"principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship\". Milan have pledged to appeal against the punishment, which as it stands means he will miss the club's Champions League games against Shakhtar Donetsk. \"It's a suspension that is absolutely excessive,\" said Milan lawyer Leandro Cantamessa. \"It seems to us a very, very unbalanced sentence. It turns Dida into the protagonist of the incident, whereas the protagonist was someone else, and that's not right from a logical point of view.\" Celtic acted swiftly to punish the 27-year-old supporter, who turned himself in and has since admitted a breach of the peace in court and will be sentenced next month.

The White House's Dana Perino accused Democrats of holding veterans care funding hostage. \"There's absolutely no reason that the veterans' bill could not have been signed by the president today, except for the political games that the Democrats decided to play with it,\" White House press secretary Dana Perino said Sunday in Crawford, Texas. Congressional Democrats had attached legislation funding veterans programs to a $150.7 billion bill that also funded a number of domestic priorities, including health, labor and education. Democrats also added $3.7 billion to what the president budgeted for veterans programs. The labor-health-education bill would increase funding by more than $10 billion over last year's funding for those programs. The president has threatened to veto the bill because of the added spending. The House passed a health-labor-education bill 269-142 last week with the veterans funding attached, but the Senate later voted to strip out the veterans funding and send the health-labor-education bill to the president. Perino accused the Democrats of \"trying to hold hostage our veterans to extra domestic spending or increases in taxes.\" \"The president wants clean legislation, a clean bill to fund the veterans,\" Perino said. On Saturday, the Democratic congressional leadership sent a letter to President Bush saying they welcomed a dialogue on spending, sayings disagreements over funding levels \"have never been so great that we cannot reach agreement on a spending plan that meets the needs of the American people.\" \"Key to this dialogue, however, is some willingness on your part to actually find common ground,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said in the letter. The leadership said last year's Congress, which was still under Republican control, had never passed a separate bill funding veterans programs. Congress also sent to the president legislation that would fund veterans care at the levels requested by the president through December 14, the leadership said. The current funding level \"is still below the $3.9 billion extra that we passed,\" said Nadeam Elshami, spokesman Pelosi. \"We are committed to getting the extra funding that the Congress already voted on the president's desk for his signature.\" The leadership blamed Republican members of Congress for stalling the funding for the veterans programs by blocking its inclusion in the larger spending bill. Perino, though, said the Democrats could still send a separate bill to the president funding the veterans program that passed both chambers of Congress. \"The Democrats decided not to send the president this bill,\" Perino said. \"That has to be laid at their feet.\" E-mail to a friend .

U.S. first lady Laura Bush said the junta \"should step aside to make way for a unified Burma.\" \"Gen. Than Shwe and his deputies are a friendless regime,\" Bush said. \"They should step aside to make way for a unified Burma [Myanmar] governed by legitimate leaders. \"The rest of the armed forces should not fear this transition -- there is room for a professional military in a democratic Burma,\" Bush said, in keeping with the U.S. policy of still using Myanmar's former name. In Wednesday's commentary, Bush called on Myanmar's military leaders to release Aun Sung Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders so they can meet with and plan for a transition to democracy. \"Meanwhile, the world watches -- and waits,\" Bush warns. \"We know that Gen. Than Shwe and his deputies have the advantage of violent force. But Ms. Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders have moral legitimacy, the support of the Burmese people and the support of the world. \"The regime's position grows weaker by the day. The generals' choice is clear: The time for a free Burma is now.\" The humanitarian rights situation in Myanmar has been a cause for the first lady in the past few months as the crisis there worsened. Myanmar state media has reported that 2,000 people were detained during the demonstrations and the crackdown against them -- under an emergency law imposed on September 25 banning assembly of more than five people -- and that 700 of those people have been released. The official death toll from Myanmar's leadership is at 10, but there are reports that hundreds were killed and thousands arrested in the wake of the demonstrations that peaked late September, which were led by Myanmar's Buddhist monks.

Congress should cut spending \"and send me a responsible measure that I can sign into law,\" President Bush said. \"The majority was elected on a pledge of fiscal responsibility, but so far, it's acting like a teenager with a new credit card,\" he said in a speech in New Albany, Indiana. The bill -- which Bush said was laden with $10 billion in \"pork\" -- would have funded the departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services. It also would have funded projects such as a prison museum, a sailing school and a program to teach Portuguese. \"Congress needs to cut out that pork, reduce the spending and send me a responsible measure that I can sign into law,\" the president said.  Watch a report on the veto \u00bb . While polls show Bush's popularity remains at near-record lows, Congress ranks even lower as a whole. The president has taken numerous opportunities to mock the spending habits of the Democratic leadership and force confrontations over the appropriations bills needed to fund the government for the 2008 budget year, which began October 1. The bill Bush vetoed Tuesday includes about $150 billion to run those departments and more than $450 billion in mandatory spending on Medicare and Medicaid, the federal health care programs for the elderly and poor, according to the House Appropriations Committee. The committee's chairman, Rep. David Obey, called Bush's veto \"not responsible and not credible.\" \"This is a bipartisan bill supported by over 50 Republicans,\" Obey, D-Wisconsin, said in a statement issued after the veto. \"There has been virtually no criticism of its contents. It is clear the only reason the president vetoed this bill is pure politics.\" Bush said Democrats are supporting $22 billion in additional spending beyond his budget proposals this year and $205 billion over five years -- money he said would ultimately be raised by tax increases. \"When the bill for all that spending comes due, Congress is going to turn to the working people, to the small-business owners and the entrepreneurs,\" he said. Tuesday's veto is the fifth cast since Democrats took control of Congress in 2006. Congress has overridden one of those, voting last week to authorize $23 billion in water projects nationwide over the president's objections. Democrats will schedule another override vote this week, an aide to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said. But Antonia Ferrier, spokeswoman for House Republican Whip Roy Blunt, said Bush's GOP allies are confident they will be able to sustain the veto. Bush signed a $470 billion Pentagon spending bill that covers the Defense Department's normal operations, but Democrats split $50 billion in spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan off into a \"bridge fund\" to which they plan to attach demands for Bush to withdraw U.S. combat troops. The measure sets up another confrontation with the White House. Bush also demanded Congress reform the alternative minimum tax -- a measure originally aimed at preventing the wealthy from evading taxes, but one that increasingly affects middle-class earners -- without raising additional revenue. He said a plan proposed by Rep. Charles Rangel, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to eliminate the tax was unacceptable. \"Preventing a tax increase in one area should not be an excuse for raising taxes in other areas,\" he said. \"Congress should eliminate the tax increases in the bill and send the AMT relief to my desk as soon as possible.\" The elimination of the tax would cause an estimated $800 billion to be lost over 10 years. To replace that, Rangel's bill would add a 4 percent surtax on individual incomes over $100,000, after deductions, and close corporate tax loopholes. The bill also would cut rates for many individual and corporate taxpayers. Republicans have already started calling it \"the mother of all tax increases.\" \"With all the other pressures on our economy, raising taxes is one of the most unwise things Congress could possibly do,\" Bush said.

The fly-half, who voiced his concerns after struggling with the boot against Australia, rejected a ball before kicking a vital three-pointer against France. \"We didn't say it last week but a non-match ball got onto the field in Marseille which Jonny kicked,\" director of rugby Rob Andrew said. \"He didn't think about it while he was kicking it. \"The match balls are marked, numbered one to six. Last night they had 'World Cup semi-final England vs France' written on them. On match night, Jonny was vigilant when kicking for goal that they were actually match balls he was kicking. \"The practice balls lose pressure and shape.

Keith Reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case. The man, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case, says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of Keith Reynolds for domestic abuse -- even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family. A report in the Denver Post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of Colorado. Paul Logli, chairman of National District Attorneys Association, told Congress this year that witness intimidation has become \"almost epidemic,\" according to the Denver Post. When asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of Colorado's witness protection program, the witness in the Reynolds case said, \"All they told us was maybe we should move.\" \"I'm pretty sure I told one of them -- either him or his wife -- about the program. I can't remember if I gave them all the details.\" the prosecutor assigned to the case, who didn't want to be named, told CNN. After Reynolds' conviction, the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home. They received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being cocked. The couple received a death threat from Reynolds himself through the mail. Watch witness describe fear of being targeted \u00bb . Reynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation. However, it is likely he'll be released within five years. No national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist, and minimal research has been conducted on the subject. The latest National Institute of Justice survey on record -- conducted more than a decade ago -- shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem. Colorado has $50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget. In contrast, the city of Denver spent almost $100,000 on landscaping last year. The state, on average, spends about $1,000 per witness. That figure supposedly includes moving expenses, rent, and furniture. The federal program spends in excess of $40 million per year on witness protection. One possible reason for the disparity is that witnesses in state cases do not get new identities, as do federal witnesses. \"It's not designed to be a long-term relocation at the public's expense; it's a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses,\" according to Peter Weir, executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Safety. Colorado's witness protection program is a \"joke,\" according to The Rev. Leon Kelly, founder and executive director of the Open Door Youth Gang Alternatives. Kelly says the state doesn't provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward. More than a decade ago, a young man named Darryl Givens asked Kelly for advice while deciding whether to testify in a murder case or face prison. Givens chose to testify. A few months later, he was shot twice in the head by men he considered friends. That day continues to haunt Kelly. Rhonda Fields says failures in the witness protection program may have contributed to her son's murder. Javad Fields was a college graduate who was engaged to be married. He had plans to move east when a Fourth of July barbecue in 2004 in changed all that. He witnessed the murder of his best friend and subsequently testified against three men suspected in the killing. Javad Fields and his fiancee were gunned down while driving along a suburban street in Aurora, Colorado. The couple, both 22, died instantly. Rhonda Fields says her son was never told about a witness protection program. She confronted prosecutors after his murder. Fields told CNN, \"I asked them what happened. Why weren't any measures taken to safeguard his life? And I was told he never asked for any protection.\" Javad's mother does not think it was her son's responsibility to ask for protection. \"I think it's the authorities' responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness,\" she said. Field's case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program. Prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting Javad Fields' personal information be kept secret, but it wasn't signed by a judge until one year later, after defense lawyers had already given the suspects Fields' personal information, along with crucial trial documents. \"I felt like the DA's office used my son to win their case but did not take the proper measures to safeguard his life,\" Rhonda Fields told CNN. District Attorney Carol Chambers maintains the program has improved. She says a notice about witness protection is now attached to every subpoena, ensuring witnesses are aware of their options. That didn't start, however, until two years after Javad Fields was killed.

The footage showed Diana and Dodi step into an elevator at the Ritz Hotel. Images taken from a security camera at the Ritz Hotel in Paris show the 36-year-old smiling as she and her lover Dodi Fayed step into an elevator and later walk out of the hotel. Further footage shows Fayed visiting a jeweler's shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an engagement ring. Earlier, a British coroner at the inquest said tt may never be known for certain whether Princess Diana was pregnant when she died in the Paris car crash. Lord Justice Scott Baker told the jury at the inquest into the deaths of the princess and her lover Dodi Fayed that scientific evidence might be unable to demonstrate \"one way or the other\" whether she was in the early stages of pregnancy. But he said they would hear \"intimate\" details of her personal life.  Watch footage of Diana's last hours \u00bb . Baker told the 11 members of the jury -- six women and five men -- Diana may have been on the contraceptive pill and that evidence she was poised to get engaged to Dodi on the night she died was contradictory. On Tuesday the judge, who is acting as coroner in the case, told the jury that a famous image taken in summer 1997 showing Diana wearing a swimsuit could not be proof she was pregnant with Dodi's child as she had not started a relationship with him at that stage. The jury is set to hear \"scene setting\" evidence, including CCTV and a tourist video. The inquest to establish cause of death is expected to be a six-month process. Fayed's father, Mohammed Al Fayed, has contended from the start that Diana and his son were murdered because the royal family \"could not accept that an Egyptian Muslim could eventually be step-father to the future king of England,\" referring to Diana's son Prince William. \"I'm hoping for justice,\" Al Fayed said outside court. \"At last, we're going to have a jury from ordinary people and I hope to reach the decision which I believe that my son and Princess Diana have been murdered by the royal family.\" Baker told the jury of Al Fayed's allegations, but again reminded them that they were responsible for deciding the facts of the case, but not to assign blame or guilt. \"You have to decide four important, but limited factual questions: who the deceased were, when they came by their deaths, where they came by their deaths and how they came by their deaths,\" Baker said, according to inquest transcripts. \"The first three questions are unlikely to give rise to any difficulty. The fourth is a rather wider question and is directed towards the means by which they died.\" Diana, 36, and 42-year-old Dodi Fayed were killed on August 31, 1997 when the Mercedes-Benz they were traveling in hit a pillar in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris. They were being pursued at the time by the paparazzi after leaving the Ritz Hotel. Driver Henri Paul, who was also killed, was drunk and driving at high speed. Bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was the sole survivor. Next week, the jury is scheduled to travel to Paris to see the crash site, along the River Seine. They are also expected to hear testimony from the paparazzi who were present after the accident. In its evidence section, the Web site for the inquest has posted previously unpublished pictures taken by paparazzi of the limo before and immediately after the accident. One is a closeup -- looking into the front of the vehicle -- that shows Diana, Fayed, Paul and Rees-Jones minutes before the crash.

Gen. Ricardo Sanchez. Lawmakers lashed back at retired Gen. Ricardo Sanchez on Sunday after he criticized the war effort. On Friday, Sanchez, who was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004, called the Iraq war \"a nightmare with no end in sight.\" He said the Bush administration, the State Department and Congress all share blame. Speaking with military reporters in Virginia, Sanchez also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial, but the politicians have not been held accountable. \"I'm astounded, really,\" South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham on CNN's \"Late Edition\" with Wolf Blitzer on Sunday. Graham, who recently returned from Baghdad, said he and GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain had visited Sanchez several times in 2003 and 2004. \"Every time we talked to Gen. Sanchez, we got pushback -- we have enough troops; Guard and reserves aren't being strained,\" Graham said. He added that Sanchez's own record in Iraq is blemished: Abu Ghraib \"got out of control under his watch. The war in general got out of control under his watch.\" But Graham said that \"finally,\" with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional U.S. troops since January, \"We are getting it right.\" Sanchez told reporters that American political leaders have cost American lives on the battlefield with their \"lust for power.\" Sanchez said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty, but that he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired. \"While the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power, our soldiers die,\" he said. That brought a tart response from McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"I wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time,\" McCain told CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" He said Sanchez should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but \"unfortunately, that doesn't happen very often.\" One of the reasons few speak out, he said, is evidenced by what happened to former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki, McCain said. Shinseki was sidelined after telling Congress that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy Iraq. Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, told ABC's \"This Week\" that Sanchez is simply wrong. \"My definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on terror,\" he said. \"I think we're making significant progress toward that end.\" But, he added, \"I think the central government in Iraq has been an embarrassment. They've not been able to produce any of the kind of political compromises that we had hoped for.\" Graham said he hopes the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki will \"step up to the plate and do something meaningful by the end of the year.\" If that does not happen, he said, \"it will be incumbent upon us, as a nation, to devise a new political strategy to find a way forward or create a stable Iraq.\" That brought a blistering response from Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser under President Carter. \"What is this? This is a colony,\" he said. \"That's the heart and essence of the difficulties we encounter.\" Even those Iraqis who were happy to see Saddam Hussein toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing U.S. presence, Brzezinski said. Though some countries are willing to go along with the United States, \"No one in the world really supports our policy in Iraq,\" he said. In his Friday speech, Sanchez added that the \"surge\" of U.S. troops into Iraq represents \"a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war.\" National Security Council spokeswoman Kate Starr did not address the comment. Instead, she said, \"We appreciate his service to the country. As Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker said, there's more work to be done but progress is being made in Iraq. And that's what we're focused on now.\" Gen. David Petraeus is the U.S. top commander in Iraq. Ryan Crocker is the U.S. ambassador to Iraq.

PETERSBURG, Florida (CNN) -- The acrimony from the Republican campaign trail carried over quickly into the CNN/YouTube GOP presidential debate Wednesday. The debate marked the first time the candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month. With five weeks to go until the first contest of the 2008 nominating season, the Republican candidates engaged in a free-for-all, trying to differentiate their views on immigration, the Iraq war, abortion, gun control and even whether they believed every word in the Bible was true. Unlike previous debates in which the candidates focused most of their attacks on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, Wednesday night's attacks were launched at each other. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney traded jabs over illegal immigration, something they have been arguing about on the trail for the past month. Romney attacked Giuliani's record, saying that as mayor, he promoted illegal immigration. And Giuliani shot back, accusing Romney of having a \"sanctuary mansion\" at his own home.  Watch the debate format produce raw moments \u00bb . \"In his case, there were six sanctuary cities. He did nothing about them. There was a sanctuary mansion -- at his own home, illegal immigrants were being employed,\" Giuliani said. Romney denied Giuliani's allegation, and the two raised their voices as they tried to talk over each other. In his quest to appeal to the hard-line immigration wing of the party, Romney also turned some of his fire on the same topic toward former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who has been rising in the polls. Rep. Tom Tancredo, who has anchored his candidacy on securing the borders and cracking down on illegal immigration, seemed delighted with the give and take, saying the other candidates were trying to \"out-Tancredo\" him. Huckabee drew one of the night's largest cheers when he said that one of the agencies he would abolish to control federal spending was the Internal Revenue Service. \"Most people in this country are more afraid of an audit than they are of a mugging, and there's a reason why,\" he said. Sen. John McCain, freshly back from a visit to Iraq over Thanksgiving and the most hawkish of the candidates, and Rep. Ron Paul, the most anti-war of the candidates, tangled on two occasions over the Iraq war.  Did  YouTubers get their questions answered? \u00bb . Asked which government programs they would cut, Paul said bringing the troops home from Iraq would save \"a trillion dollars.\" McCain said: \"It's that kind of isolationism that caused World War II,\" which drew some hoots from the crowd.  Watch McCain, Paul spar on Iraq \u00bb . Paul replied: \"The real question you have to ask is why do I get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel?\" A retired brigadier general, Keith Kerr, who is gay, asked candidates if they thought U.S. military personnel were professional enough to work with gay and lesbian troops. CNN later learned that a June media release from the campaign of Democratic  front-runner Clinton listed Kerr as a member of its steering committee for gay and lesbian supporters.  Watch Kerr deny that the Clinton campaign influenced his question \u00bb . David Bohrman, CNN senior vice president and executive producer of the debate, said, \"We regret this incident. CNN would not have used the general's question had we known that he was connected to any presidential candidate.\" Political Ticker . Kerr told CNN after the debate that he has not worked for the Clinton campaign and was representing no one other than himself. Kerr also said he is a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, a national gay and lesbian Republican grass-roots organization. Prior to the debate, CNN had verified Kerr's military background and that he had not contributed money to any presidential candidate. In a section of the debate about gun ownership rights, three of the GOP presidential hopefuls said they do not own guns: McCain, Giuliani and Romney. Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson quipped, \"I own a couple of guns -- but I'm not going to tell you what they are or where they are.\"  Watch the candidates address gun control \u00bb . The debate turned personal when a viewer, holding the Bible, asked: \"Do you believe every word of this book? And I mean specifically, this book that I am holding in my hand.\" Huckabee, a Baptist minister, said, \"Sure, I believe the Bible is exactly what it is.\" Giuliani said he believes the Bible, but not \"literally true in every respect.\" After that, Romney stammered a bit when moderator Anderson Cooper asked him if he believed every word.  Watch the candidates get personal about the Bible \u00bb . \"Yeah, the Bible is the word of God. ... I might interpret the word differently than you interpret the word, but I read the Bible and I believe the Bible is the word of God,\" Romney said. When asked about abortion, Romney said he was wrong in favoring a woman's right to choose -- his position when he was elected governor of Massachusetts. \"If people in this country are looking for someone who's never made a mistake on a policy issue and is not willing to admit they're ever wrong, they're going to have to find somebody else. On abortion, I was wrong,\" he said. His remarks came in response to the 30-second video produced for the debate by Thompson's campaign, which included a clip of Romney expressing support for Roe vs. Wade during a 1994 debate against Sen. Ted Kennedy. When asked what women and doctors should be charged with if abortion was to become illegal,  Paul said it was not an issue for the president or the federal government. \"We don't need a federal abortion police, that's the last thing we need,\" Paul said. He added that the issue should be left to the states and courts and not federal authorities. On the issues of taxes, Thompson said he'd \"never met a tax he liked.\" \"I've got a tax-cut bill on the table. But I don't do pledges to anybody but the American people,\" he said. His response was met by a \"Go, Fred, go!\" from a member of the audience. On the issue of trade with China, Rep. Duncan Hunter said China is \"cheating on trade ... and it's in the interest of the United States to stop China's cheating. Buy American this Christmas season -- that might keep your neighbor from losing his job.\" The candidates fielded video questions submitted by the public via the YouTube Web site, just as Democratic White House candidates did in July. The debate was the first time the GOP candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month. CNN's political team viewed nearly 5,000 videos for the GOP debate -- about 2,000 more than they saw for the Democrats' debate.

A U.S. military panel reviews a detainee's case at Camp Cropper near Baghdad. Speaking in Arabic, Maj. Gen. Doug Stone on Wednesday reassured Iraqis about how the 25,000 detainees -- mostly Sunnis -- are treated after being taken into custody on suspicion of involvement in the insurgency. Stone described the detention system as \"open and transparent,\" saying it makes the detainees better citizens and helps break the cycle of violence and poverty in the country. Stone said detainees get free medical care equal to what he gets as a general, food and water made to Islamic standards, educational opportunities, jobs skills and contact with families. The U.S. detention centers -- at Camp Bucca near the southern port city of Basra and in Camp Cropper near Baghdad -- are political sore points for Sunnis, who make up 83 percent of the detainees held. The main Sunni political coalition -- the Iraqi Accord Front -- cited the centers as one reason for quitting the government during the summer. Last month, the U.S.-led coalition launched Operation Lion's Paw in which between 50 and 70 detainees would be released daily during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan after taking a pledge not to rejoin the insurgency against the Shiite-led government. \"This pledge is an Iraqi pledge, a pledge before an Iraqi judge, frequently with a family member present,\" Stone said. \"I am pleased to tell you that in the more 1,000 that have gone through this program and taken the pledge, not one has returned to threaten Iraqi or coalition forces.\" Stone said the releases would continue at the same pace beyond Ramadan. Stone's description seems a far cry from the Abu Ghraib prison operated by the U.S. military in the first years after the invasion. That prison was closed down and razed in the wake of an international scandal over prisoner abuse. \"There are no secrets that go on in detention,\" Stone said. \"Our facilities are open to inspection by any agency that we in the federal government believe is credible. These agencies are welcomed because they are windows for the world.\"  See what life's like inside Camp Cropper's walls \u00bb . By the time of their release, \"detainees grow in terms of working in an inter-sectarian environment,\" he said. Each detainee has a chance to take classes up to a sixth-grade level, and high school classes are being planned, Stone said. About one-third -- or 8,000 -- are in school, with 7,000 having passed the fifth-grade level, he said. The 860 detainees who are 17 or younger are all in school, Stone said. The average stay for a detainee is 300 days, but some have been detained for two years or longer, he said. A review board interviews detainees to decide if they are a threat to security, he said. If they are deemed not to be, they are offered freedom in exchange for taking the pledge. Only 280 detainees are foreigners, mostly from Syria, Egypt, Iran, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, he said.

Holding baby Brianna, Mary Winkler stands next to Matthew. In the foreground are Mary Alice and Patricia. Charles and Diane Winkler, parents of slain minister Matthew Winkler, had asked the court to intervene and either revoke Mary Winkler's visitation rights or allow them to proceed only under supervision of a counselor. The children -- Patricia, Mary Alice and Brianna -- have been living with their grandparents since their mother was arrested last year. Winkler has not seen the children in 15 months, said Kay Farese Turner, her attorney. She said her client was \"absolutely elated about the news and believes this will be her best Christmas ever.\" Turner said she believes the visit may come before Christmas. A jury convicted Winkler earlier this year of voluntary manslaughter in the shotgun death of Matthew Winkler -- not the first-degree murder conviction prosecutors had wanted. She said the slaying came after years of abuse, including physical violence and being forced to dress \"slutty\" for undesirable sex acts. Winkler received a three-year sentence, but a judge required her to serve only 210 days, gave her credit for the five months she had already served and allowed her to serve the remaining 60 days in a mental health facility. She was released in August. At the time of their father's death in March 2006, Patricia was 8, Mary Alice was 6 and Brianna was 1. Charles and Diane Winkler have moved to terminate Mary Winkler's rights and have filed a $2 million wrongful death suit against her for their son's slaying. The termination issue has not been decided in court. Turner said the court may want to determine what, if any, bond Winkler has with her children before making a decision. Attempts by CNN to contact attorneys for the Winklers were not immediately successful Wednesday. In September, a lower court granted Winkler visitation with her daughters pending the outcome of the custody battle. The court specified the visits be supervised by a guardian ad litem appointed to represent the children's interests and supervised by members of the couple Winkler is living with or by her sister. A subsequent appeal by the grandparents was denied, leading to their Supreme Court appeal. The Winklers said if their former daughter-in-law got visitation with the children at all, it should be under the supervision of a professional counselor. At a September hearing, according to court documents, they said the children \"exhibit fear and confusion\" toward their mother \"and her role in their father's death.\" One expert, in testimony, quoted Patricia as saying her mother had killed her father and, \"I don't know if she will kill me. I want to ask her if she would do that to me. It scares me, kind of; if she did, well, I guess I would see my father.\" The Winklers also said that after telephone calls with their mother, the children experienced \"urination accidents, sleeping problems, graphic nightmares and sleepwalking.\" They said the lower court erred by failing to appoint the guardian ad litem until after the September hearing. Turner, however, said she believes terminating Winkler's parental rights would not be in the children's best interest. \"She has a faith rarely seen, and she loves those children,\" Turner said. After Matthew Winkler's death, Winkler fled with the girls to the Alabama coast, where she was arrested. She said during a September appearance on the \"Oprah Winfrey Show\" that she never expected to get away with killing her husband, but that she fled to be with her daughters and \"have some good times.\" E-mail to a friend .

GEO-TV and ARY Digital offer a variety of programming, including news, entertainment, sports and music.

We were ready for it to a certain extent.\" \"Eventually they decided to put their feet on the pipe, as it were.\" The government has made numerous demands of the network, although none of them official, Aslan said. \"It's done through intermediaries,\" he said. \"[Dulling] down the content, not having certain anchors, some of the hosts of our programs and talk shows.\" Musharraf's emergency order put several restrictions on the media, preventing journalists from expressing opinions prejudicial to \"the ideology ... or integrity of Pakistan.\" Journalists are also restricted from covering suicide bombings and militant activity and could face three-year jail terms if they \"ridicule\" members of the government or armed forces. Almost a dozen journalists have been arrested. Musharraf has denied that his restrictions bar criticism, saying they only ask for responsibility in reporting. But last week, Pakistan expelled three print journalists for using language in an editorial that a Pakistani official called offensive to Musharraf. The editorial criticized Musharraf and the United States and Britain for continuing to support him. While many Pakistani journalists have protested the restrictions, some smaller television channels have complied with the government's restrictions. GEO and ARY have refused. \"It seems most of the other channels have kowtowed in order to survive,\" Aslan said. Musharraf has said the emergency order improves stability and will foster peaceful parliamentary elections, which he has said he would like to see take place before January 9. The exact date will be set by Pakistan's Election Commission.

He joins us on MME to talk about the vision for Qatar, how Qatari Diar fits into it and its investments outside Gulf in Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Egypt and Europe. With oil prices hitting $88 this week, John Defterios begins by asking Nasser al Ansari about the differences he sees now compared to the 1970s when oil prices were also high. Any lessons learned? Nasser al Ansari: I believe so. In the 1970s, local government here did not deal in a very sophisticated way with this wealth. But now we are fortunate with a high level of education and the reformations in government policies in this region. We now understand how to utilize this wealth and economical growth. JD: I don't think most people know that you sit on one of the largest natural gas fields in the world and will likely be the largest exporter by 2010. This must give you great cushion to expand the Qatari Diar model. NA: Although we have this and we are fortunate with this, Qatar has adopted a policy to diversify its portfolio from its natural resources to other investment opportunities and one of them is Qatari Diar. We are investing a lot in real estate, not just in Qatar but worldwide. JD: In fact very close in the neighborhood as well. It's almost foreign policy strategy to invest in the poorer countries in the region. Is this to help the neighborhood develop alongside Qatar? NA: I think with the knowledge and know-how that we have gained in this area of expertise, we would like to export it to other countries to help their economical reformations; to try to create business opportunities for their local businessmen and to create job opportunities for the people in that particular country. JD: It's quite a radical departure say from the International Monetary Fund or World Bank giving loans or grants for development. This is turning the world upside down in your region, it is not? NA: Yes, I would like to assure you at Qatari Diar we are not in the business of lending. JD: You want a hard return. NA: We want return but we always think of the people when we are investing in these countries. I mean we want to make sure that the investment we are making is there for the long-term. Qatari Diar has a policy: it's a long-term policy not short-term. JD: Give me some insight on why Qatari Diar feels as comfortable in London with Chelsea Barracks as in Cuba, for example, with some of the projects you're undertaking. What makes you think you can pull that off? NA: I think with the expertise that we have and with the strength that we have, we would like to showcase the strength of the people of Qatar and we want to pull the flag of the state of Qatar even across the Atlantic and we are determined to do so. We are a small country but with big ideas.

The Supreme Court will hold oral arguments January 7 about the constitutionality of lethal injection protocols. Forty-two people have been put to death this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), a Washington-based group that opposes the practice. That figure is down 57 percent from what it was in 1999, when 98 inmates were executed. Next year's figures are expected to drop further. The Supreme Court is to hold oral arguments January 7 about whether lethal injection protocols in 36 of the 37 states with the death penalty are constitutional.  See how the rates have dropped \u00bb . The justices placed a moratorium on executions in late September, when they decided to review a Kentucky case about whether the three-drug lethal \"cocktail\" of chemicals represents \"cruel and unusual punishment,\" since it may cause excruciating pain to inmates unable to express discomfort. Stays of executions have been issued in several states until the larger constitutional issues are addressed. If the high court finds the procedures unconstitutional, it could take years before death-penalty states would meet legal standards necessary to resume lethal injection. And even if the method is declared acceptable, it would be months before new execution dates could be set. Ten states carried out executions this year. Outside the South, Arizona, South Dakota, Indiana, and Ohio together subjected six men to lethal injection.  Learn about states' death penalty policies and statistics \u00bb . Texas continues to lead the nation, with 62 percent of executions nationwide this year. Overall, 86 percent this year were in the South. No more executions are scheduled this year. \"The death penalty has been in a period of decline for many years,\" said Richard Dieter, executive director of DPIC. \"Two thousand seven will be known as the year executions came to a temporary halt and as the year of concrete legislation reconsidering the death penalty.\" Death penalty supporters acknowledge that states outside the South have been reluctant to impose the punishment, even in the face of rising big-city crime rates. \"I think the main problem is that the death penalty is not being imposed often enough in those urban jurisdictions,\" said Kent Scheidegger of the Sacramento-based Criminal Justice Legal Foundation. \"I think people of the cities are not getting the quality of justice that people elsewhere receive. I think we need to build support for the death penalty and need to impose it more regularly where it is warranted.\" New Jersey's legislature voted last week to outlaw the death penalty -- the first state to do so in 42 years -- and Gov. Jon Corzine signed the measure into law Monday. At the same time, he commuted the sentences of the eight men on the state's death row. The move was largely symbolic, since no executions have occurred there since 1963. Similar bills in Nebraska, New Mexico and Montana failed this year in the legislature. State lawmakers in Maryland, Colorado, North Carolina, Tennessee and California are also considering abolishing the death penalty, but no bills have been introduced. The Supreme Court on January 4 will decide whether to review an appeal from Louisiana inmate Patrick Kennedy, sentenced to death in 2003 for raping his 8-year-old stepdaughter. The state's high court upheld the punishment as appropriate. The justices in 1976 banned capital punishment for rape, but 19 years later, Louisiana passed a law allowing execution for the sexual violation of a child under 12. State lawmakers distinguished the earlier high court case as pertaining only to \"adult women.\" E-mail to a friend .", "d0404188997ef57e0355b18fb867599b89c80407": "MOSCOW, Russia -- Zenit Saint Petersburg have clinched their first Russian title in the post-Soviet Union era with a hard-fought 1-0 victory at Ramenskoye on Sunday. Zenit captain Anatoly Timoshuk kisses the Russian Premier League trophy after their victory at Ramenskoye. The win means Zenit finish top of the table with 61 points, two points ahead of second-placed Spartak Moscow, who beat city rivals Dynamo 2-1. CKSA Moscow finished third on 53 points. Zenit went ahead in the 15th minute when Radek Sirl's shot from the edge of the box deflected off a Ramenskoye defender and beat goalkeeper Antonin Kinski. After the interval, the hosts poured forward seeking an equalizer and created several chances -- but Zenit held firm to secure their first championship since 1984 and make a hero out of Dutch coach Dick Advocaat. Nine-times champions Spartak took the lead midway through the first-half. Russian international striker Roman Pavyuchenko netted the opening goal in the 24th minute with a powerful shot from the edge of the six-yard box after a mix- up in the Dynamo defence. Brazilian striker Soares Welliton made it 2-0 seven minutes after halftime, heading home Pavlyuchenko's precise cross.

David Murphy's goals have earned Hibernian four points against the Auld Firm this season. Gordon Strachan's team head the table by three points from Glasgow rivals Rangers, who have three games in hand ahead of Sunday's trip to Aberdeen. Visiting Hibernian, whose manager John Collins surprisingly resigned on Thursday citing a lack of financial backing from the Edinburgh side's board, took the lead in the 20th minute through left-back David Murphy. The Englishman played a one-two with Abdessalam Benjelloun before crashing a shot from the edge of the box past goalkeeper Mark Brown and in off the crossbar. Murphy's only other goal this season came in Hibs' 1-0 win at Rangers on October 6. Brown did well to keep out Merouane Zemmama's audacious shot from just inside the Celtic half soon after, and also tipped over Brian Kerr's looping header three minutes after half-time. Substitute Jiri Jarosik rescued Celtic from a first home SPL defeat this season in the 78th minute after being teed up by Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, who then headed against the post with two minutes to play. Hibernian held on despite having to play the final few minutes with 10 men, after Benjelloun was stretchered off with their three substitutes already used. The victory lifted the visitors up into fifth place, while Celtic have taken just six points from the last five games. Strachan, who confirmed he is hoping to sign Brazilian defender Coelho next month, said: \"We need to cut out the silly mistakes because if you look at some of the goals we have let in away from home this season, they are silly mistakes. \"We could have definitely done something with every one of them. I'm happy with the number of chance we've made in the last few weeks, but unhappy with individual mistakes. \"It's not been great to look at, and we need to cut it out. We have honest lads walking in to the dressing room and saying, 'That was my fault.' \"I said to them, 'It's very commendable lads but we can't keep doing this.' There has been a lot going right for us, but one or two things going wrong. We have to deal with that, and then I will look forward to the rest of the season.\" Third-placed Motherwell missed the chance to move above Rangers after being beaten 3-0 at home by Falkirk, who climbed to ninth with two goals in the second half to Michael Higdon and then another from Patrick Clegg on 65 minutes. Fourth-placed Dundee United failed to take advantage, losing 2-1 at home to bottom club Gretna -- whose only two wins this season have come against the Tangerines. Kenny Deuchar put the visitors ahead in the 12th minute before striker Noel Hunt leveled on 29, and Nicky Deverdics scored the eventual winner for the Borders outfit three minutes before half-time. Inverness Caledonian Thistle followed up last weekend's shock 3-2 victory against Celtic by also winning at Hearts by the same scoreline. The visitors led through Russell Duncan after 22 minutes and John Rankin made it 2-0 with a 53rd-minute penalty before Christophe Berra pulled one back on 62 and Lithuanian striker Andrius Velicka leveled from the spot (90). However, Graham Bayne scored a dramatic injury-time winner to lift Caley into the top six. In Saturday's other game, second-bottom St Mirren drew 0-0 at home to fellow strugglers Kilmarnock to be left seven points ahead of Gretna.

Now, is it possible that this \"highway\" mentioned in Chapter 35 is actually Interstate 35 that runs through six U.S. states, from southern Texas to northern Minnesota? Some Christians have faith that is indeed the case. It was with that interesting belief in mind that we decided to head to Texas, the southernmost state in the I-35 corridor, to do a story about a prayer campaign called \"Light the Highway.\" Churchgoers in all six states recently finished 35 days of praying alongside Interstate 35, but the prayers are still continuing. Some of the faithful believe that in order to fulfill the prophecy of I-35 being the \"holy\" highway, it needs some intensive prayer first. So we watched as about 25 fervent and enthusiastic Christians prayed on the the interstate's shoulder in Dallas. They chanted loudly and vibrantly, making many people in the neighborhood wonder what was going on. They prayed that adult businesses along the corridor would \"see the light\" and perhaps close down. They prayed for safety and freedom from crime for people who lived along the interstate. They prayed that all Americans would accept Jesus into their lives.  Watch believers offer prayers \u00bb . The woman who came up with the concept of \"Light the Highway\" is a Texas minister named Cindy Jacobs. She says she can't be sure Interstate 35 really is what is mentioned in the Bible but says she received a revelation to start this campaign after \"once again reading Isaiah, Chapter 35.\" Jacobs also points out that perhaps there is a link between the area near this highway and tragedies that have happened in history, such as the bridge collapse on I-35 in Minneapolis last August and the assassination of JFK 44 years ago near I-35 in Dallas. That's why prayer certainly can't hurt, she adds. Now, it's only fair to say most people, the religious and the non-religious alike, don't buy any of this, but none more than the owners of some of the adult businesses along I-35. At an adult go-go club, the owner tells us he resents people trying to impose their will on others. And he says his club holds fundraisers, food drives and toy drives to help the community. But on the side of the road, the prayerful aren't going to change their minds. Holy highways and nude clubs, they believe, are not a combination God has in mind.

On Monday evening, she was still changing the prices in her store as her customers looked on and complained, she told a reporter. Alcohol is now 10 percent more expensive; cigarettes are 20 percent pricier. \"Really, it's difficult to buy at these prices,\" she said, then joked, \"They say they're going to stop eating so that they can continue drinking.\" The Venezuelan government is placing a higher tax on alcohol and cigarettes in an effort to cut consumption and prevent what it views as the social, economic and moral consequences of drinking and smoking, said Jose Vielma Mora, superintendent of Seniat, the government body that oversees the collection of taxes. Taxes on whiskey, brandy, cognac and other drinks that don't come from cane sugar have been raised $1.79 (3,838 bolivares) per liter, the government-run Bolivarian News Agency said. \"It's unfair because, in the end, the consumer is the one who pays,\" said Fernando Fernandez, a liquor exporter. Chavez has described whiskey as a drink for rich people, not for revolutionaries. \"We cannot be spending the international reserves of this country on whiskey,\" he said. The moves represent the first steps toward transforming each Venezuelan into what Chavez calls \"the new man.\" Chavez has cited the life of revolutionary socialist icon Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara as an example of how to lead a more pure life. In April, Chavez told a graduating class of medical students in Caracas, Venezuela, that the level of consumption of alcohol in the country represents a threat to public health and ought to make residents feel ashamed, according to an ABN report. \"The vice causes much harm, not only to individuals, but to the collective health of the nation,\" said Chavez, who said the dangers result in an increase in car wrecks and domestic violence. For his part, he has said he drinks too much coffee. Also effective Monday, stores near schools, churches and cultural centers will not be granted licenses to sell alcohol. Taxes on cigarette imports have also increased, from 50 percent to 70 percent of the total price. On the street, some people said they don't understand the motivations for the increase, but predicted their consumption would not change. \"The Venezuelan is not going to stop drinking or smoking,\" said one person. Chavez also plans to increase taxes on luxury items such as Hummers, which are imported privately and at great expense. There is no Hummer dealership in the country. Higher oil prices in recent years have translated into higher consumption in petroleum-rich Venezuela. Last year, car sales increased by about 70 percent, according to the CIA World Factbook. But Chavez, who was in Cuba on Monday visiting communist leader Fidel Castro, said he wants to focus less on material goals for Venezuela's 27 million people, 38 percent of whom live in poverty.

CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta and former President Clinton lead the discussion at the first Fit Nation Summit. \"We need to do something about it for our children, and for our country, because something like this could easily collapse our nation if we don't act now,\" Clinton said. Clinton and CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, gathered with experts from across the country Wednesday to explore solutions to America's obesity crisis. Two-thirds of adult Americans are overweight or obese; the same is true for one-third of U.S. children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Obesity carries increased risk of myriad health problems, including hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and arthritis. Gupta, Clinton and a panel of experts addressed such proposed solutions as healthy school lunches, elimination of trans fats, the need for healthier food in urban communities and the importance of supporting community-based efforts to fight obesity.  Watch Gupta explain the solutions proposed at the Fit Nation Summit \u00bb . Clinton, who's been tackling the obesity issue over the past few years with his Alliance for a Healthier Generation, stressed the need to help educate people about the importance of a healthy diet and exercising together. Motivating Americans, especially kids, won't be easy, Clinton said. \"They need to be handled with care. Kids need to know it's important, but [fitness] can't be boring,\" he said. \"There's no shame, there's no embarrassment. We have to let them know it's all good, but you have to do it.\" Michael Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a strong advocate against trans fats in foods, stressed that the Food and Drug Administration should ban trans fats altogether and stop leaving it up to local and state governments. Trans fats, at one time, thought to be good fat substitutes, over the years have been shown to raise LDL or bad cholesterol in people and lower their HDL, or good cholesterol. \"They're just not good for our health, Jacobson said. However, Dr. Robert Eckel, former president of the American Heart Association, warned, \"Although we support the removal of trans fats, our biggest concern is what they'll be replaced with. We need to think about that, because there will be a substitute.\" The panel took questions from an audience of 150 people -- mostly obesity experts or those who work in industries that deal with obesity. Gupta was inspired to launch Fit Nation, an ongoing, multiplatform, grass-roots initiative against obesity. Over the past three years, Gupta and the CNN Medical Unit have crisscrossed the country, asking Americans to take charge of their weight by exercising more and eating healthier. This year, Gupta traveled from Michigan to California asking the public to pledge to add 1 million hours to their collective lives by getting off the couch and exercising. Since he began the tour in April, the campaign has surpassed its goal, with exercise pledges close to four times that amount. Gupta said he hopes that legislators and administrators who can make a difference in policy and perhaps change attitudes about obesity will hear the solutions discussed at the summit. \"I''ve covered a lot of stories on obesity,\" Gupta said. \"There's a battle going on, and we need to win the battle. I've talked to people out there and many are just blas\u00e9. \"This is our opportunity to make them care.\" E-mail to a friend .", "45027afbe54056c567ca8a48906dd06200f6d8c1": "DURBAN, South Africa -- India's Yuvraj Singh smashed six sixes in one over as England crashed out of cricket's World Twenty20 tournament in South Africa on Wednesday. Yuvraj Singh smashes his sixth successive six off England fast bowler Stuart Broad . Paul Collingwood's side were eliminated at the Super Eights stage after South Africa earlier beat New Zealand by six wickets in Durban. England then lost by 18 runs to the Singh-inspired Indians, who kept their semifinal hopes alive ahead of Thursday's must-win clash with the hosts. Singh reached the fastest 50 in Twenty20 history, needing just 12 deliveries, as India made 218-4. The left-hander's six consecutive sixes in the 19th over bowled by Stuart Broad made him the first player to do so in Twenty20 matches and just the fourth in all senior cricket. South Africa's Herschelle Gibbs performed the feat at the 50-over World Cup in the West Indies earlier this year, while Sir Garfield Sobers and Ravi Shastri achieved it in first-class matches. Singh's innings ended on 58 -- from 16 balls -- when he hit a full-toss from Andrew Flintoff to captain Collingwood at long-on from the penultimate delivery of the final over, in which he also cleared the boundary ropes once. Virender Sehwag top-scored with 68 off 52 balls, putting on 136 for the first wicket with Gautam Gambhir, who hit 58 off 41 deliveries. Broad ended with the embarrassing figures of 0-60 off his four overs, while fellow seamer Chris Tremlett took 2-45. In reply, England battled gamely but could only post 200-6 in their 20 overs. Opener Vikram Solanki top-scored with 43 off 31 balls, and Kevin Pietersen hit 39 off 23 deliveries, but no-one could match the fireworks provided by Singh. Left-arm seamer Irfan Pathan claimed figures of 3-37 off four overs, while Rudra Pratap Singh took 2-28. If India can beat South Africa, it would create a three-way tie and require net run-rates to decide the two teams going through. The Proteas have two wins from two Group E outings after beating New Zealand, who have completed their Super Eights fixtures with two victories and a defeat. South Africa restricted the Black Caps to 153-8 from their 20 overs on Wednesday, then reached the target with five deliveries to spare as Justin Kemp made an unbeaten 89. Kemp was named man of the match after smashing a six off the otherwise economical Mark Gillespie for the winning runs. He belted six sixes and six fours in his 56-ball innings, having come to the crease in the fourth over with South Africa reeling at 17-2. Kemp added 28 in four overs with Gibbs (19) before putting on another 65 in eight overs with Mark Boucher. Boucher departed for 23, caught by wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum off Gillespie, who ended with figures of 2-11 off 3.1 overs. The experienced Shaun Pollock then joined Kemp, and struck one six in his unbeaten 16 off 11 deliveries to help guide the Proteas to their second victory. The in-form Craig McMillan top-scored for the Kiwis, hitting an unbeaten 48 off only 25 balls to follow up his blistering 57 in Tuesday's five-run win against England. McCullum had put on 68 for the first wicket with Lou Vincent, scoring 38 before becoming the first of Morne Morkel's four victims. Morkel, who ended with figures of 4-17 off four overs, then removed Ross Taylor (1) two runs later and later bowled the dangerous Jacob Oram for a quickfire 15. He had Shane Bond caught by Boucher, and then almost became the first Twenty20 bowler to claim five wickets when his penultimate delivery -- which clean bowled Gillespie -- was declared a no-ball by umpire Billy Doctrove.

Authorities have not yet decided if Chester Arthur Stiles will appear in person or via video link. The judge will set a date for the arraignment at that hearing. Stiles, 37, was taken into custody Monday night after a Henderson, Nevada, police officer pulled over the white Buick Century he was driving. A former girlfriend of Stiles' said that, before the arrest, she lived in fear after going to police to identify the suspect after seeing enhanced photos from the videotape on the local news. \"I've had my share of nightmares,\" Elaine Thomas told CNN's Nancy Grace. Thomas said she screamed when she recognized the photos on television and had no choice but to contact police about the man she had thought was a \"weapons enthusiast\" with only a minor criminal record.  Watch Thomas say how she felt when she saw the photos \u00bb . \"How could I not tell them who that man was? That little girl suffered unimaginable things, and I knew for a fact it was him,\" Thomas said. The judge in the case will hold an administrative hearing Wednesday, but Stiles will not be present, Clark County court spokesman Michael Sommermeyer said. Stiles was already being sought on an unrelated 2004 charge of felony lewdness with a child under 14, Sommermeyer said, adding that authorities amended that earlier filing on October 4 to include 20 counts related to the videotaped rape, including sexual assault and attempted sexual assault. Jerry T. Donohue, the attorney for the girl's mother, told CNN that the child on the videotape was younger than 3 when the abuse occurred. Henderson Police Officer Mike Dye said he pulled over Stiles' car Monday night because it did not have a license plate and became suspicious when the driver gave him an expired California driver's license with a photo that did not look like him. Dye said he and another officer, Mike Gower, questioned Stiles until he admitted his identity. \"He finally told us, 'Hey, I'm Chester Stiles. I'm the guy you're looking for,'\" Dye said. \"At that time, he said, 'I'm sick of running.'\" Dye said Stiles was calm and cooperative. Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was turned over to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police and booked into the jail in Clark County, where he had been sought in connection with the videotape, which shows a girl being sexually assaulted. The girl, who is now 7, was found last month after a nationwide search. The tape was given to authorities by Darren Tuck, who told police he had found it in the desert five months before handing it over. Because of the delay, during which Tuck allegedly showed the tape to others, he faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography. He turned himself in to authorities in Nye County, Nevada, earlier this month. Professionals have evaluated the girl in the videotape since she was found, and she appears to be \"healthy and fine and happy,\" her mother's attorney said this month. The mother had not known her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until late last month, Donohue said. \"A family friend called her and said, 'My God, you need to turn on the TV. I believe that is your daughter,' \" Donohue said. Donohue said the mother recognized Stiles, a former animal trainer. The alleged abuse most likely occurred while the mother -- a single woman working six days a week -- was at work, Donohue said. Another former girlfriend of Stiles', Tina Allen, said this month she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is \"mortified\" by the allegations against him. \"He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,\" Allen said. Allen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, the alleged assault victim. Todd Allen, Tina Allen's son, said he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video.  E-mail to a friend .

Making his deployment even tougher is the fact his wife may not be around when he comes back. Mildred and Eduardo Gonzalez worry about what would happen to their family if she is deported. His wife faces deportation to Guatemala -- her home country that she hasn't seen since 1989. He also doesn't know what would happen to his young son, Eduardo Jr., if that happens. \"I like being in uniform and serving my country, but if she goes back I'm going to have to give it all up and just get out and take care of my son and get a job,\" he said. \"Defending the country that's trying to kick my family out is a thought that always runs through my mind.\" Gonzalez, who works on helicopters that bring cargo, supplies and military personnel in and out of Iraq, testified before a House Judiciary Committee panel last month, detailing his situation and urging officials to consider some sort of policy to deal with cases like his, where military members' families could be deported while they're defending their country overseas.  Watch \"they're tearing families apart\" \u00bb . \"I want to serve my country 100 percent. But with this issue in the back of my mind, I feel I can't do that,\" he testified on September 6. The U.S. military does not have a policy to deal with such cases. Each is handled case-by-case, not by the military, but by immigration authorities. The government doesn't have numbers on how many military members are in predicaments similar  to Gonzalez's. Immigration officials also said marrying a U.S. citizen does not mean the spouse is automatically entitled to U.S. citizenship or permanent legal status. Lt. Col. Margaret Stock, a member of the U.S. Army Reserves who teaches immigration law at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, said she believes there should be an overall policy dealing with the potential deportation of family members of active duty military members. \"You got to understand. When you're in a combat zone, you need to be focusing all of your energies on fighting the enemy. You can't be worried that your loved ones back home could be shipped off to a foreign country where you're never going to see them again,\" she said. Stock also said the government is conflicted about how to treat such cases. On the one hand, the government is supposed to be providing military families with assistance, housing and other forms of benefits while their spouses are overseas. On the other hand, the same government is trying to deport the very same people. \"What's happening right now is, because of the dysfunction and complexity of our immigration laws, we've got people fighting overseas who are facing the impossible situation of having family members facing deportation back home,\" she said. In Gonzalez's case, his wife, Mildred, came to the United States with her mother in 1989 when she was 5 years old. They were granted political asylum because of their status as war refugees from Guatemala. In September 2000, Mildred's mother applied for legalization and included her daughter in that application. Her mother was granted legal status in July 2004, according to Gonzalez. However, six weeks earlier, Gonzalez and Mildred got married, canceling Mildred's ability to apply for legal status through her mother because she was no longer an unmarried daughter under the age of 21. As a result, her legal status still remains in jeopardy. A judge in June granted her a one-year extension to remain in the United States. If her legal status does not change by June 8, 2008, she will have 60 days to voluntarily leave the country or face deportation. That's just fine, according to Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which lobbies for tougher laws on illegal immigration. \"What you're talking about is amnesty for illegal immigrants who have a relative in the armed forces, and that's just outrageous,\" he said. \"What we're talking about here is letting lawbreakers get away with their actions just because they have a relative in the military. ...

Officials say about 300,000 people are still trapped by the worst flooding in the region for 50 years. The Grijalva River pushed over its banks through the state capital of Villahermosa on Thursday, forcing government workers to evacuate and leaving up to 80 percent of the city flooded, Gov. Andres Granier's office told CNN. About 700,000 people have seen their homes flooded, with about 300,000 of those still trapped there, Granier's office reported. One death had been blamed on the floods, which followed weeks of heavy rain in the largely swampy state. Tabasco borders Guatemala to the south and the Gulf of Mexico to the north. The Associated Press reported that thousands of people clung to rooftops, huddled inside waterlogged homes or hunkered down in shelters in an attempt to survive the worst flooding the region has seen in 50 years. Weather forecasters predicted more rain in the coming days. The flooding was not related to Tropical Storm Noel, which was pounding the Caribbean. The Grijalva River, one of two large waterways ringing Villahermosa, has risen 6.5 feet (2 meters) above its \"critical\" level and gushed into the city's center, according to AP. Authorities said some of the rivers were continuing to rise. President Felipe Calderon visited the area on Wednesday and promised the federal government's full support.

Afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in Taliban-controlled Helmand province in April 2007. The report from the U.N.'s Office on Drugs and Crime shows the export value of this year's poppy harvest stood at around $4 billion, a 29 per cent increase over 2006. Despite Afghan security forces' efforts to curb the trade, 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007, the report said. Opium is derived from poppies, and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground. The report said opium has accounted for more than half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product in 2007. InvestorWords.com defines GDP as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a calendar year. According to the U.N. survey, about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers. The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop, to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade. Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001. \"Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys,\" Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. \"Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban's main funding source.\" James Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade. \"We share the U.N.'s concerns,\" Appathurai told CNN. \"Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation.\" He said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly. \"The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO, but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government,\" Appathurai said. Farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country, Appathurai said. However, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand, poppy production was going on largely unchecked. According to the report, U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes. Costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region. He called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Afghanistan and its neighbors. \"Drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations,\" the U.N. drug chief said. Appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on. He also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor Afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production. \"You cannot have eradication in isolation. If we don't give them the support to produce alternative crops, then by wiping out their opium fields, you are only creating enemies for the future,\" he said.

Defending champion Federer, playing in his first tournament since winning the U.S. Open six weeks ago, made 38 unforced errors.

Juan Roman Riquelme celebrates after scoring his first goal in Argentina's win against Bolivia. The midfielder followed up his brace of spectacular free-kicks in the opening 2-0 victory against Chile to help put his country five points clear of second-placed Brazil, who play Peru in Lima on Sunday. Riquelme again shrugged off his lack of club action with Villarreal, where he has fallen out with the Spanish side's management, to net twice in the second spell after Sergio Aguero gave the home side a first-half lead. The 19-year-old scored his first goal at international level five minutes before the interval after starting in a three-man attack with Carlos Tevez and Lionel Messi. He headed home after Martin Demichelis nodded a cross from Manchester United striker Tevez back across goal. Riquelme added the second 11 minutes after the break with a dipping free-kick which beat Carlos Arias from 25 yards, having been superbly denied by the keeper's one-handed effort shortly beforehand.

Hillary Clinton labeling it \"too little, too late.\" Sen. Hillary Clinton listens as Gen. David Petraeus testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee. In an open letter to Bush, Clinton said the troop withdrawal \"is simply too little, too late, and unacceptable to this Congress, and to the American people who have made clear their strong desire to bring our troops home, and end this war.\" Bush on Thursday is expected to endorse the recommendations of Gen. David Petraeus that the troop levels in Iraq be lowered to 130,000 by July, down from the \"surge\" level of 160,000. \"As commander in chief, you have the authority and ability to greatly accelerate the redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq, and to bring so many more troops home so much faster,\" the New York Democrat said. \"I strongly urge you to choose this course of action.\" In an interview Wednesday with CNN, one of Clinton's chief rivals for the 2008 nomination, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, said the president is returning to an earlier, failed policy. \"We now are still in the same position as we essentially were in June 2006,\" he said. \"We are in the same levels of violence; we are at the same levels of dysfunctional when it comes to the government in Iraq, and the American people at some point have a right to ask from their leadership in Washington and from the president: When is enough enough?\" Watch '08 Dems weigh in on war in Iraq \u00bb . Obama presented a new plan for Iraq on Wednesday afternoon in Clinton, Iowa. It calls for an immediate drawdown of combat operations at a pace of one or two brigades every month, to be completed by the end of next year, according to excerpts released before his speech. A brigade comprises between 3,000 and 5,000 soldiers. Obama recommended a new constitutional convention for Iraq, a new regional diplomatic effort and steps to confront the country's humanitarian crisis. \"Let me be clear: There is no military solution in Iraq, and there never was. The best way to protect our security and to pressure Iraq's leaders to resolve their civil war is to immediately begin to remove our combat troops,\" Obama said in his speech. Presidential candidate John Edwards, who has been pressing congressional Democrats to take a more confrontational stance against President Bush, called for an immediate withdrawal of 40,000 to 50,000 troops. In a prepared statement, Edwards, a Democrat from North Carolina, said Obama, Clinton and Republican Sen. John Warner of Virginia, who recently called for a withdrawal to begin by Christmas, have \"a moral responsibility to use every tool available to them, including a filibuster, to force the president to change course.\" Edwards also called Obama's plan for troop withdrawal a copy of the president's plan . \"Sen. Obama would withdraw only one to two combat brigades a month between now and the end of next year,\" said Edwards, \"which for the next several months could essentially mimic the president's own plans to withdraw 30,000 troops by next summer.\" In a statement, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Connecticut, said Wednesday that it was useless to debate tactics when \"the underlying policy is a complete failure.\" \"I call on my colleagues to do what needs to be done to end our involvement in this civil war and help restore our national security by clearly and directly declaring that they will not support any Iraq measure without a firm, enforceable deadline tied to funding for the completion of redeployment of troops from Iraq,\" Dodd said. Democrats lack the votes in Congress to force the president to bring the troops home and are seeking a compromise position. Congressional Democratic leaders are meeting with Republican lawmakers, who want a change in war policy but are unwilling to cut funding or set a timeline for withdrawal. Privately, congressional Democrats concede that the next president probably will inherit at least a deployment of 100,000 troops in Iraq. The Democratic presidential candidates, particularly the five in Congress, face pressure from liberal groups such as MoveOn.org demanding that they directly confront the president. Obama said it was unlikely he would vote for any legislation that does not include a definite withdrawal deadline. \"You know, we are going to have to evaluate what's available, but it appears clear to me that the president is not willing to compromise, short of Congress forcing him to accept a shorter timetable, and, absent that, we are essentially engaging in a bunch of symbolic action there,\" Obama told CNN. \"What we need is a clear message from the Congress that it is time for us to change course, and it's time for us to do that,\" he said.

In a treatment of a Bridgeman Art Library photo, the High shows visitors Jules Arnout's \"View of the Grand Gallery.\" This is the case this week, as Atlanta's High Museum of Art couples its public opening of a second year of Louvre-fueled shows from Paris, France, with an exhibition about influences on the Impressionists. \"Inspiring Impressionism\" is organized by the Denver Art Museum. It opened Tuesday at the High, to run there through January  2008. With the backing of Northern Trust, the show will then travel to Denver February 23 to May 25, 2008, and then on to the Seattle Art Museum from June 19 to September 21, 2008. Why not start in Denver? That museum this fall is host to pieces seen in the first year of the three-year Louvre Atlanta series of exhibitions. Like priceless dominos falling, these shows roll around the country and the world, globalization dictating galas, super-sensitive custom shipping companies probably among the biggest winners.  See a gallery of images from 'Inspiring Impressionism' at the High Museum of Art \u00bb . Another unintended effect may be shadowing of one important outing by another. It should be interesting to learn whether showing \"Inspiring Impressionism\" at the High on the same time frame as the second year of Louvre Atlanta pays off. Do all the boats in Monet's \"Autumn on the Seine, Argenteuil\" float? Smart museum-goers will see it all. \"The Louvre and the Ancient World\" and the companion show \"The Eye of Josephine,\" after all, look at some of the oldest treasures in the Louvre's vast holdings.   See a gallery of some of the highlights of the Louvre Atlanta shows \u00bb . The fit is comfortable, in a way, the Impressionist movement of the turn of the last century finding its main proponents in French artists. The emphasis here, however, is on what older works may have moved and motivated such artists as Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul C\u00e9zanne. One very distinctive connection from the Louvre Atlanta opener of last year is a section of this new show that looks at the tradition of modern-era artists learning by studying the work of masters at the Louvre, Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo's \"The Beggar Boy\" of around 1650 being one of the most-copied canvases in Western art's modern history. From the outset, visitors to \"Inspiring Impressionism\" are reminded of the Louvre treasures all around them at the High: The Impressionism show's entry gallery is flanked by a handsome photographic treatment of Louis Jules Arnout's \"View of the Grand Gallery at the Louvre\" from between 1850 and 1870. In that original painting and color lithograph that followed, Arnout captured the bustle of artists working and visitors promenading in the Louvre's chief exhibition space that runs along the Seine in Paris. In fact, even older-era echoes of this same concept are encountered on looking at Louvre Atlanta's \"The Tiber\" marble from the first century A.D., you're reminded that Michelangelo himself was aware of that piece, influenced by it, presumably inspired by it. So a surprise symmetry takes shape at the High this fall, as visitors contemplate dialogues between museums (the Louvre, the High, Denver, Seattle), the viewers of art in Europe and the United States, and the artists themselves in France, in the U.S. and elsewhere. High director Michael Shapiro calls these synchronicities \"visual evidence of connections.\" His colleagues Timothy Standring of Denver and Ann Dumas of London, England, have held up their end of this conversational eyeful with timely contributions, glimpses of Old World craft from Titian and Velasquez to Fragonard and Rubens -- and the \"moderns\" who saw beyond them to a new age of aesthetic debate. Don't miss some of the comments and writings of various artists, used as part of the display of the show at the High. Degas may have said it most honestly: \"No art is less spontaneous than mine. What I do is the result of refection and the study of the Old Masters.\" Joining Northern trust Corporation in funding the exhibition are the National Endowment for the Humanities, and support is also provided by an indemnity from the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities.

A KC-135 tanker lands at Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey in 2003. Turkey, a longtime U.S. ally and NATO partner, was incensed by the resolution calling the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks genocide and threatened to block access to Incirlik Air Base after the resolution passed a House committee vote. The base, in southern Turkey near Syria, is a major resupply center for U.S. operations in Iraq and elsewhere in the Mideast and Asia. The Pentagon is preparing to set up new supply routes for troops in Iraq if Turkey cuts off U.S. access to the strategically important Incirlik, military officials said Tuesday. Ankara acknowledges the killings of Armenians during World War I but vehemently objects to the \"genocide\" label. The House Foreign Affairs Committee last week adopted the nonbinding resolution. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would bring the measure to a vote of the full House sometime next month. But the Bush administration urged Congress to drop the issue, and some leading Democrats urged Pelosi not to bring it to the floor. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer signaled Tuesday that the vote might be put off. \"I said I thought we would bring this up prior to us leaving here,\" said Hoyer of Maryland. \"I have not changed on that, although I would be less than candid to say that there are a number of people who are revisiting their own positions. We will have to determine where everybody is.\" Democratic Rep. Ike Skelton, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, announced his opposition to the resolution last week. And Democratic Reps. Alcee Hastings of Florida and John Tanner of Tennessee, both members of the U.S. House delegation to NATO, urged Pelosi to reconsider in a letter released Tuesday. \"More than half of the cargo flown into Iraq and Afghanistan comes through Incirlik Air Base, and this base would be a key component of any plans for redeployment of our troops in the future,\" they wrote. Lt. Gen. Carter Ham, the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Pentagon planners are looking at \"a broad range of options\" to keep food, fuel and ammunition flowing to U.S. troops in Iraq if Turkey blocks Incirlik. \"We're confident that we'll find ways to do that,\" Ham told reporters at the Pentagon. \"There's likely to be some increased cost and some other implications for that, and obviously we'd prefer to maintain the access that we have.\" Defense Secretary Robert Gates echoed lawmakers' concerns last week. \"About 70 percent of all air cargo going into Iraq goes through Turkey. ... About a third of the fuel that they consume goes through Turkey or comes from Turkey,\" Gates said. He also said that 95 percent of the Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protective vehicles, or MRAPs, being deployed in Iraq are flown through Turkey. The vehicles are built to withstand roadside bombs.  See Incirlik's key location \u00bb . The U.S. military issued a \"warning order\" a few days ago to ensure that alternative air crews, planes, fuel and routes are lined up if Turkey stops or restricts U.S. access to Incirlik, a source said. Jordan and Kuwait are among the alternatives the United States is considering. Some fear pursuit of the resolution would also embolden the Turks to attack Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq which could further complicate Iraqi stability, U.S. officials said. Incirlik offers 10,000- and 9,000-foot runways and 57 hardened aircraft shelters, according Globalsecurity.org, a source of background information about military issues. Globalsecurity said Incirlik has become a hub for cargo shipments to Iraq, taking over for Rhein-Main Air Base in Germany because it is closer to Iraq, reducing the strain on troops and aircraft.

Brazilian Dida was also fined 60,000 Swiss francs by European football's ruling body following an incident involving a supporter during the Champions clash against Celtic in Scotland on October 3.

Dube, 43, was killed in Johannesburg around 8 p.m. local time Thursday after someone tried to steal his car, Gallo Record Company said in a statement. Police said he was shot. The statement said Dube attempted to escape but died almost instantly from his wounds. Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans, and his death cast a shadow over festivities ahead of South Africa's highly-anticipated appearance in the rugby World Cup final with England this weekend. News of his death was the headline in many Friday newspapers, knocking the World Cup off the front pages for the first time in days.

(He was) one of their most successful artists and certainly one of their leading reggae artists.\" Sutherland said Dube was an extremely respected musician who toured extensively around the world. Dube had just returned from a tour of the United States that stretched from California to New York. His record company said Dube leaves \"a great void\" in the music industry after a 25-year career. Dube recorded 22 albums in Zulu, English and Afrikaans. Born outside Johannesburg in 1964, Dube was named \"Lucky\" by his mother because he was the first child to be born after several failed pregnancies. Dube started singing in 1982, joining a band playing Mbaqanga, or traditional Zulu music. It was only later that he began recording reggae tracks as a solo singer, but the genre was to dominate and define the remainder of his career. Ivor Haarburger, the chief exectutive of Gallo Music Group, said he was deeply saddened by the loss. \"Lucky was not just an extraordinary artist, he was a personal friend,\" Haarburger said. \"It's so sad to lose such a great friend and so tragically.\" Dube is survived by his wife, Zanele, and his seven children: Bongi, Nonkululeko, Thokozani, Laura, Siyanda, Philani and three-month old Melokuhle.

FEMA Director David Paulison promised on Tuesday \"a different type of response than the federal government put together for Katrina.\" Paulison said Katrina \"was a wake-up call\" and that \"this is a new FEMA.\" President Bush signed a federal disaster declaration Wednesday, freeing up federal funds for families affected by the wildfires in seven counties in Southern California. \"I will continue to make sure that our efforts are coordinated, that we are responding to the needs of people, but most importantly I want the people in Southern California to know that Americans all across this land care deeply about them,\" he said. The action follows an emergency declaration by Bush on Tuesday morning for the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. He said he's \"looking forward\" to his visit to the region on Thursday. According to a statement from the White House, the federal disaster declaration will allow for federal aid that \"can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.\" FEMA and other relief and rescue services face significantly different challenges in the fire zone than they did on the Gulf Coast in 2005. For example, the fires aren't covering every square foot of the region, as Katrina did. The devastation in California is intense but not universal. During and immediately after Katrina, the destruction was so complete that relief personnel and supplies -- even the U.S. Army -- could not get within miles of the disaster's epicenter, New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward, for several days. By contrast, roads in Southern California have remained open for residents to get out and help to get in without delay. Residents there are generally more affluent and are able to use their own vehicles to escape, whereas many of Katrina's victims were poor and had no means of transportation. Victims in California are not stranded on rooftops without food or drinkable water, but are able travel the relatively short distances to safe places. One of those safe places is San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium, which is not endangered by the fires. FEMA and other relief agencies are able to stage supplies and meet victims' needs in an organized way. New Orleans' Superdome, on the other hand, sitting in the center of the disaster zone, was severely damaged by hurricane winds and threatened by rising water. What had been a shelter devolved into a trap. Katrina also wiped out the Gulf Coast's communications infrastructure, crippling the coordination of relief efforts -- even for the military. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff acknowledged Tuesday that the government's response machinery had benefited from the Katrina experience. \"I think there's no question that [there were] a couple of the lessons from Katrina which we have put into effect here,\" Chertoff said. \"First of all, planning and preparation in advance for these kinds of challenges, so that we have worked together and planned together with the Defense Department and with state authorities well in advance of the crisis. That's been a big help here,\" Chertoff said . \"Second, we have really flooded the zone as quickly as possible by staging assets to deal both with the firefighting issue and with the response issue,\" Chertoff said. Chertoff said federal officials began discussing over the weekend the need to have FEMA ready, \"and as we saw the evacuation issue becoming more prominent, and the number of people seeking shelter becoming more prominent, we sprang into action yesterday. \"So we've been monitoring the situation continuously. The president's been on top of it. We've been on top of it. And we're going to continue to stay ahead of this as far as we can.\" Chertoff said Tuesday that he hadn't waited for the paperwork to be signed before staging assistance. \"We have been moving cots, blankets, other supplies into the area of San Diego so that we can handle any necessity for additional sheltering capacity,\" he said. \"We've also moved air assets to be poised to take flight when we do have the opportunity to deal with the fire, once the winds begin to die down.\" People left homeless by the fires can already go online to apply for federal help at www.fema.gov, Paulison said.  Watch Paulison discuss the \"new FEMA\" \u00bb . He denied suggestions similar to those made in the aftermath of Katrina that the federal response was hampered because National Guard equipment was in short supply because of the Iraq War. \"I just haven't seen that,\" he said. The U.S. military has sent aircraft to help fight the fires, including 11 Defense Department helicopters equipped with water buckets and six C-130 aircraft able to drop water and flame retardant. More than 17,000 National Guardsmen have been made available; 550 Marines were ready for deployment from Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego; and 12 Defense Department firefighting teams, were engaged.

Chris Benoit strangled his wife and suffocated his son before hanging himself in June. The Dynamite Kid and his partner, Davey Boy Smith, were known as the British Bulldogs. They were quick, agile and muscular, and in 1986 they won the World Wrestling Federation tag team championship. Young Benoit dreamed of wrestling like the Dynamite Kid, whose real name is Tom Billington. At the beginning of his career, Benoit adopted the Dynamite nickname and copied his idol's signature moves. In June, Benoit murdered his wife and young son before hanging himself. Investigators found testosterone, painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in Chris Benoit's body, Georgia's chief medical examiner said a month later. When asked about Benoit's double murder-suicide, Billington told CNN, \"It can make you aggressive, the steroids. But personally I wouldn't, you know, kill no bleeding kid, or wife either.\" Billington now lives in a public housing apartment outside Manchester, England. He has lost the use of his legs. A pin sticks out from one of his toes. Billington blames his wrestling life for doing this to him -- wrestling and the fact that he ignored doctors who told him to stop the punishment to his body. And from the steroids, he said. Billington told CNN that the steroids came from doctors, from friends, even from steroids meant for horses. He took them all, took a terrible pounding in the ring, and like his partner (who died at age 39 in 2002), began taking extensive amounts of painkillers. Benoit's death has refocused a media spotlight on the organization for which he wrestled, now known as World Wrestling Entertainment, and the man who has ruled wrestling for years, Chairman of the Board Vince McMahon. McMahon, appearing with Linda McMahon, his wife and WWE CEO, told CNN: \"Nothing from the WWE, under any set of circumstances had anything to do with Chris Benoit murdering his family. How did we know Chris Benoit would turn into a monster.\" Read a full transcript of the McMahons interview . Vince McMahon defended the organization, saying its drug-testing policy was not just for show. \"Our policy stacks up just as well as anyone else's in sport, although again emphasizing we are entertainment, and no one in entertainment, no one has this kind of wellness policy,\" McMahon said. Critics say McMahon pushes his stars and non-stars, works them too many nights per year and has encouraged the large physiques prevalent in modern wrestling. They say McMahon only looks at his employees as commodities, pawns in a huge business. His businesses are quite successful. About 16 million people a week tune into WWE TV shows. Two of their cable programs -- \"Raw\" and \"Friday Night Smackdown\" -- are weekly ratings giants. Pay-per-view specials generate an average of $100 million per year. When asked about the high number of former wrestlers who had died before they turned 50 years old, Vince McMahon said each person in the WWE bore responsibility for their own lives -- especially outside the arena. \"If someone passes through our organization, it is not our responsibility for someone's personal activities,\" he said. He also said there isn't \"any organization in the world, be it entertainment or be it sport, that can tell you that they are totally drug-free.\"  Watch as a WWE wrestler says the perception of steroid use is wrong \u00bb . The McMahons said the WWE is taking steps toward improving its oversight of its athletes. Since the newest WWE drug screening program began in February 2006, more than 30 of the organization's wrestlers have been suspended, including two since CNN's interview with the McMahons. David Black -- who helped the NFL develop its drug program and now runs tests for the WWE -- says twice that number have tested positive and been given a warning. But Dr. Gary Wadler, a world-renowned expert in the study of drugs and athletes, says the WWE is not doing enough. \"It certainly falls far, far short of where it needs to be,\" he said. \"And there is a gold standard, and I measure all these sporting and entertainment activities against this gold standard. And [the WWE is] miles apart.\" Wadler, a longtime critic of McMahon, was referring to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency in Colorado Springs, Colorado. U.S. athletes training for the Olympics are randomly tested and, if caught just once, face a two-year suspension from competition. If caught a second time, they can be banned for life. Black's programs test wrestlers four times a year. The first is a \"baseline\" test, according to the WWE. Black then tests for \"nonmedical\" uses, meaning that if an athlete has a prescription, he is cleared. \"It's just a loophole that in my mind guts the entire program,\" said Travis Tygart, who heads the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. McMahon denies that his wrestlers are pushed to use steroids. He says the average wrestler is lighter than in recent years.  Watch one of the new WWE stars talk about being \"straight edge\" \u00bb . \"There's an expression in our business, that here is where you make your money. It's your face, it's what you do with it,\" he said. \"It's your personality, it's what you do with it. It's your delivery, your elocution. It's storyline, it's things, all those things that are theatrical as well as athletic in the ring.\" E-mail to a friend .

And, if you're lucky, you'll be able to look back on those years and laugh. If you're less lucky, you spent those years on a reality show, so for the rest of time, millions of strangers can look back on them and laugh instead. In modern times, cats frolic among the ruins of ancient Rome. But, hey, it could be worse. You could be responsible for the fall of Western Civilization, just like Justa Grata Honoria, the Roman princess whose wild ways and (literally) naked ambition set off a chain reaction that culminated in the destruction of the Roman Empire. Barely regal . Smart, conniving, and ruthless, Honoria possessed all the attributes befitting a Roman emperor, except for that pesky Y chromosome. As a young girl, she watched as her dimwitted six-year-old brother, Valentinian III, was crowned emperor of the Western Roman Empire, while she was set aside to await a suitable marriage. Hardly content to lead a quiet and chaste life, Honoria rebelled with aplomb, sleeping her way through the royal court while still in her teens. Although her after-hours habits caused quite the scandal, they failed to satiate her need for attention and power, so Honoria set her eyes on the throne. Employing her ample charms, she seduced her brother's royal chamberlain, Eugenius, and together, they plotted to murder Valentinian and seize power. But, alas, their scheme was soon exposed. Eugenius was executed, and Honoria was sent to a convent in Constantinople. Life as a nun was a fate worse than death for Honoria, but even that couldn't quell her ambition. She spent her years at the nunnery plotting one escape attempt after another. Finally, out of sheer desperation, she turned to sources outside the empire. Her savior would have to be powerful enough to defy Valentinian and risk open war with Rome. Only one man fit that description: Attila, king of the Huns. Attila the hubby . Honoria got the barbarian's attention with a mutually beneficial proposal: If Attila would rescue her, she would marry him, and he would get half of the Western Empire as her dowry. Of course, Honoria was in no position to rightfully offer any portion of the Roman Empire. But she was betting that after marrying her, Attila would conquer the whole Empire, and she'd become queen to boot. Attila had secretly been planning a move against Rome for years, and Honoria's letter gave him the perfect opportunity to strike. Wasting no time, he told Valentinian that he planned to marry Honoria, and demanded the dowry he'd been promised. Naturally, Valentinian refused, and Attila used his status as a \"wronged husband\" to invade Roman territory in 451 C.E. The Hun armies quickly swept through the Empire, destroying everything in their path, and eventually they arrived in Rome. Like all the other cities before it, Rome would also have been annihilated were it not for the famine and disease that devastated the Huns during the invasion. Rome survived Attila's assault with the unlikely help of another nomadic enemy tribe, the Visigoths, but the Western Empire never recovered. Within a generation, the armies of the Goths, Franks, and Huns had overrun the area. The Princess bride . Ultimately, Honoria became neither Roman empress nor a Hun queen. Attila never rescued her, and she was eventually sent back to Rome and left to her brother's justice. Not wanting to cause a scandal by having her executed, and unwilling to send her back into exile where she could scheme again, Valentinian settled on a suitable third option. After years of struggle, Honoria finally suffered the fate she had been dreading all along: She was married off to an elderly Roman senator, and the rest of her life went unrecorded by history.

FIFA chief Blatter was among those in Sheffield to kick off the 150th birthday celebrations of football's oldest club. Guests of honor at a service at Sheffield Cathedral included Sepp Blatter, president of football world governing body FIFA, and Massimo Moratti, president of Italian giants Inter Milan who are scheduled to play a friendly against Sheffield FC next month. Other guests attending a dinner in the club's honor included Real Madrid President Ramon Calderon and England and Manchester United legend Bobby Charlton. Pele -- widely recognized as the greatest footballer ever to play the game -- is also due in town next month to attend Sheffield FC's clash with Inter. Blatter was unveiling a bust of the club's co-founder William Prest -- one of two cricket fans who founded Sheffield FC, then known simply as Sheffield Club, on October 24, 1857 after deciding they needed a new sport to keep them active during the winter. Many more football clubs soon sprung up and by 1862 there were said to be 15 in and around the Sheffield area. The Football Association -- which codified the basic rules of the modern game -- was established in London the following year. Sheffield FC was instrumental in developing set rules for the game. The club studied existing rules and laid down a code of laws, which formed the foundation of the first commonly-accepted set of rules for the sport, according to the Sheffield FC Web site. The team was also responsible for several innovations in the game -- including heading, which was unheard of until 1875, when Sheffield traveled to London for a game. According to the team's Web site, the sight of the Sheffield players using their foreheads in addition to their feet reduced the London crowd to hysterics. Other innovations attributed to the team include the solid crossbar on the goal, corner kicks, free kicks for fouls, and playing a match under floodlights. Despite its celebrated place in the history of the world's most popular sport, Sheffield FC has never played at a professional level. The club currently competes in the Unibond League's First Division South, seven divisions beneath the English Premier League. The city of Sheffield has two professional clubs -- United and Wednesday -- who both currently play in English football's second tier, the Coca-Cola Championship. Sheffield FC's proudest achievement on the pitch came in 1904 when the team beat Ealing 3-1 to win the FA Amateur Cup in front of 6,000 people. But 100 years later in 2004, Blatter presented Sheffield FC with FIFA's \"Order of Merit\" -- an honor previously awarded only to the nine-time European champions Real Madrid.

So, how did the trend for pointed-toe shoes start? Manolo who? Long before they ever made an appearance on the TV show \"Sex and the City,\" pointed shoes were favored by Polish nobles, who introduced the fashion to England on a diplomatic visit in the 1300s. The shoes, dubbed \"crackowes\" or \"poulaines\" -- after Krak\u00f3w, Poland -- were so long that a chain running from the toe to the knee was often required to keep them from dragging. In 1363 the English attempted to rein in the look by law, assigning shoe spans to social classes. Commoners could sport footwear with toes of up to six inches, while those in the royal ranks were allowed a full two feet in length. Who invented the sports bra? In 1977 University of Vermont student Lisa Lindahl was running 30 miles a week -- and her bra wasn't holding up. With the help of two classmates, Lindahl sewed together two jock straps and -- presto! -- the sports bra was born. The coeds founded the company Jogbra a year later, garnering eternal gratitude from exercise-loving women everywhere. Almost 40,000 sports bras are now sold annually. Real Simple: Best bras for every figure . Is there a real Mary Jane behind Mary Jane shoes? Not quite: The most widely held theory is that the single-strapped footwear was named for a character in \"Buster Brown,\" a children's comic strip that was popular in the early 1900s. Mary Jane was either Buster Brown's sweetheart or sister, depending on which source you consult. What's the connection between Shakespeare and raincoats? Gabardine, a water-repellent fabric invented by Burberry, got its first mention from Shakespeare. The Bard used the word in The Merchant of Venice to refer to a coarse cloak worn as protection from storms. During World War I, British officers on the front lines kept warm and dry in a uniform coat made of the material -- the original Burberry trench. Who was the first person known to have pierced ears? No one knows who originated the style, but there's evidence that as early as 2500 B.C. Sumerian women wore pierced earrings -- gold half-moon hoops. And guys tired of defending their diamond studs can rest easy: Men have been wearing earrings since ancient Egypt, where the jewelry was introduced in 1500 B.C. Real Simple: Best way to clean jewelry . What was the inspiration for Lilly Pulitzer's colorful printed dresses? Bored Palm Beach socialite Lilly Pulitzer opened a juice stand in 1959 to pass the time, but she found one drawback: The citrus concoctions discolored her clothes. She instructed her dressmaker to create a uniform that would camouflage the bright stains, and the \"Lilly\" design -- sleeveless cotton shifts in vibrant prints -- was born. The style was an instant hit with customers, who soon began placing more orders for dresses than juice. How did pumps, stilettos, and sneakers get their names? The term pump first popped up in 1550 in England, where male servants sported the style. It is said that the noise they made while wearing the loose-fitting shoes resembled the sound of a water pump. The word sneaker entered the language in the 1870s; the rubber soles made the shoes quiet and therefore \"sneaky.\" The modern usage of stiletto, a Renaissance-era Italian word for an assassin's narrow-bladed knife, made its debut in 1953. The word turned out to be especially appropriate, because the shoes' pointy heels were murder on wooden floors. When did folks start toting around umbrellas? For thousands of years, in such places as Egypt, China, Japan, Mesopotamia, and India, umbrellas were used exclusively to shade the heads of dignitaries from the broiling sun. (When it rained, the well-to-do stayed dry in covered carriages and sedan chairs.) Umbrellas weren't employed in inclement weather until the late 17th and early 18th centuries. And another hundred years passed before advances in manufacturing made them lightweight, portable, and available to average Joes. Have bikinis always been so popular? Hardly! Named for the nuclear-testing site Bikini Atoll, the suits first appeared in 1946, but American women thought them immodest. Not until the 1960s were they accepted, possibly helped by the hit song \"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini.\" Were French cuffs really created for the battlefield? It is said that the cuffs were designed to be used as handkerchiefs in combat. But, in fact, French royalty invented the style in the 1500s, when flowing sleeves were the rage; nobles would tie their sleeves back with fasteners. Amusingly, the competitive English tried to take credit for the fashion, which to this day they refer to only as \"double cuffs.\" Have women always carried purses? Once upon a time, ladies stored their essentials in a little waist sack tied under their clothing (sort of an early ancestor of the fanny pack) and accessible through slits in their skirts. Around 1800, thinner, silkier fabrics and slimmer cuts came into vogue, and women could no longer hide the bulging sacks around their midsections. The solution? They began carrying their belongings in small pocketbooks instead. Why is underwear nicknamed \"drawers\"? In the 16th century, drawers became a common term for both men's and women's underpants. Made of linen, the items were no-frills and looked more or less interchangeable (this being well before Victoria ever had a secret; decorative lace trim started appearing on the garments only in the middle of the 19th century). Most likely, underwear earned this distinctly unsexy epithet because it describes the way that people put on their unmentionables -- drawing them up and over the lower part of the body.

The rallies, which draw mostly teens, are one part concert, one part Christian revival. \"I had to stop listening to them for a while,\" said Hutchins, who lives in Cumming, Georgia, and plays the piano, guitar and harmonica. He said the group's world view \"had a negative effect on me,\" and made him irritable and angry. \"God owns my life, not the Beatles,\" he said simply. Although Hutchins said he enjoys a wide range of music -- from Pink Floyd and Arcade Fire to Christian bands such as Hillsong United -- he said he has to be careful of what music he listens to, for the same reason he temporarily turned off the Beatles. Hutchins, a 16-year-old graced with poise and thoughtfulness, is one of many teenagers who say that some part of popular culture, with its ubiquitous references to sex, drugs and violence, has harmed him. Last year, Hutchins and his Christian youth group attended an Acquire the Fire rally in Atlanta, Georgia, he said. Acquire the Fire -- regional rallies held across the country -- and BattleCry -- the larger rallies held this year in only three cities -- are the products of the evangelical Christian organization Teen Mania.  Go behind-the-scenes with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at a BattleCry event \u00bb . One part concert, one part Christian revival, the rallies seek to \"stage a reverse revolution\" against secular popular culture. They have the pull of headlining rock concerts, drawing thousands of people regardless of the region of the country, the month of year or the day of the week. The audiences are nearly always predominantly teenagers and young adults. From 2006 to 2007, a total of 127,830 people attended the 34 Acquire the Fire rallies, and 71,414 people attended the three BattleCry events held in San Francisco, California; Detroit, Michigan; and Bristow, Virginia, according to Teen Mania. Watch flags, fireworks and teens at rally . For Hutchins, who said he struggled in his early adolescence to fit in and be cool before having a personal experience with God about four years ago, the organization's message is exactly right. \"We don't have to be branded by the culture, we are branded by God,\" he said. \"Be who God created you to be.\" But the glossy, glamorous appeal of popular culture too often obscures that path to God, Teen Mania followers say. And so, Ron Luce, the 46-year-old founder of the organization, has waged a modern-day crusade against \"purveyors of popular culture,\" whom he has condemned as \"the enemy.\" More than two decades old, Teen Mania estimates it has reached more than 2 million teens with its message \"of living completely for Christ.\" The organization is sprawling. In addition to its live stadium rallies, there are BattleCry shirts and hats, mobile screen savers, books and a television program. There are international mission trips -- Hutchins attended one in Tijuana, Mexico, this summer. There is even a Teen Mania internship, a one-year program called the Honor Academy, based in Lindale, Texas. In the live events, Luce couples the earnest appeal of a young father with a preacher's ability to mobilize a crowd. He weaves disturbing statistics about teenagers amid his gospel. Today's teenagers are in crisis, he says. \"We're fighting for those who don't know they have a voice, that are being manipulated by our pop culture indulging in things that, really, they're not mature enough to be thinking about yet,\" Luce told CNN. \"Kids are hurting,\" he said. And of those who he feels inflict these moral wounds, Luce said, \"We call them terrorists, virtue terrorists, that are destroying our kids.\" \"They're raping virgin teenage America on the sidewalk, and everybody's walking by and acting like everything's OK. And it's just not OK.\" To some, Luce's rhetoric is off-putting, hateful and divisive. Opponents point to his views on homosexuality -- not \"in God's plan\" -- and abortion -- the \"ending of a precious life\" -- and say Luce is imposing conservative values on vulnerable teenagers. Explore Americans' views on religion . It is this criticism that Luce and his followers confronted head-on in March at BattleCry San Francisco. There, in arguably the most liberal city in the United States, protesters, armed with megaphones and poster board signs, rallied against BattleCry on the steps of City Hall as the Christian teenagers circled and prayed in a demonstration of their own. \"Ron Luce is a liar!\" one protester shouted. \"Let me hear you say Christian fascist,\" another yelled. Luce and the youths, some as young as 11, also raised their voices. \"God, I ask that as we do this BattleCry, Lord, that you would reveal yourself to the teenagers, God, here, God,\" Mindy Peterson, shouted. Peterson is a member of Teen Mania's Honor Academy. Afterward, Peterson railed against what she said was the protesters' mischaracterization of BattleCry. \"These people think that our war is against other people. They think that our war is against man. And our war isn't. Our war's against ... the pain in teenagers' hearts, like depression, alcoholism. Those things that -- that are, like, tearing our teenagers apart,\" she said. While much milder in his terms, Hutchins agrees. \"We're a generation that is kind of troubled,\" he said. Luce wants to \"rescue the hearts of our generation,\" he added. And of the critics' contention that the rallies, the organization, the message is neo-conservatism wrapped in Biblical verse? Hutchins smiles, nods patiently. \"I don't go because I have a political agenda,\" he said, adding that his friends don't, either. \"Mostly, what we're concerned with is Jesus.\" E-mail to a friend .

Lebanon's civil war was in full flood. One afternoon the shells began raining down on our neighborhood in Beirut. A Lebanese woman and her son run through west Beirut in 1989 during fighting between rival forces. We ran from school screaming. Forget the book bags, classmates, homework. Just run. Out of breath, my knees giving way, it seemed to take forever to reach our local shelter -- a dark humid room at the back of our apartment block. The memory of that terrifying afternoon receded -- until recently. After more than a decade of relative peace and reconstruction, the bombings and assassinations have returned to Beirut. Every time I hear of a new explosion, I think of a frightened child sitting in darkness. In 1988, I watched the last throes of Lebanon's civil war firsthand -- and like millions of Lebanese, sad, frustrated and often fearful.  See a timeline of Lebanon's recent history \u00bb . Now I watch from another continent, but I find those same emotions resurfacing. The conspiracies, the car bombs, the threatening rhetoric and political deadlock are eerily familiar. The actors are like shadows from a long gone past. They are grayer perhaps --  those who have avoided assassination. But the cast in Lebanon's tragedy has changed little in two decades. Then, as now, a presidential election is the setting, and the struggle where religion and clan play the main roles threatens to set Lebanon back 20 years.  See bios of Lebanon's major players \u00bb . In 1988, the president's term was coming to an end and the warring factions were unable to agree on a new candidate. Militias prevented parliament members from reaching the assembly building. Compromise was nowhere in sight. The West had abandoned Lebanon to the manipulation of its neighbors. Syria had its choice for president; Israel had its own allies -- a foil for growing Muslim radicalism. The country was awash with weapons. In his last act as president, Amin Gemayel named fellow Christian and Army Chief Michel Aoun as prime minister. At a stroke, he shattered the convention that a Muslim hold that position. Muslims refused to serve in the Cabinet and the country ended up with two governments. Aoun famously declared: \"I am prime minister and six ministers in one.\" Aoun's \"War of Liberation\" against Syria turned into defeat. Then, he turned on fellow Christians of the Lebanese Forces in the \"War of Elimination.\" When that failed, the Syrians drove Aoun to take refuge at the French Embassy. In August 1990, I came to CNN as a World Report panelist. I tried to explain Lebanon's chaos, the bewildering array of factions and the horrors of civil war for ordinary civilians. I had seen people killed in front of me; children orphaned in seconds, parents burying their infants in oversize white coffins. So when I was offered the opportunity to stay at CNN, I gratefully accepted the chance to escape the anarchy. But almost as I left, the civil war was being laid to rest. The various factions had fought each other to a standstill; Arab governments, supported by the West, helped negotiate a new constitutional framework overseen by Syrian influence. Peace came to Lebanon, but it would be five years before I returned. In 1995, I went back and was stunned. I kept looking around for checkpoints manned by militants. I couldn't believe that I could go anywhere without being harassed or kidnapped by one faction or another. No longer did identity -- Christian, Muslim or Druze -- define where Lebanese could go. People mixed freely in chic coffee shops and smoked the hubble-bubble, laughing at the same jokes. It was as if Lebanon's divisions had been wiped away by some magic eraser. Downtown Beirut, once rocked by explosions and pitted with bullet holes, was rocking to Lebanese pop music. The dusty sandbags had given way to boutiques carrying the latest European fashions and deluxe hotels. Lovers had returned to Beirut's Corniche, overlooking the Mediterranean, for romantic strolls at sunset. But the agreement that ended the civil war was more a truce than a real settlement -- and was overseen by a \"pax Syriana.\" As anti-Syrian sentiment grew, so did political tensions. On Valentine's Day 2005, the Corniche was once again rocked by an explosion.  Former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed. The symbolism left me speechless. On the day of love, Lebanon was thrown back into its most hateful history. It had been widely expected that Hariri would run for office again and demand the withdrawal of Syrian troops. Suspicion fell on Damascus, which vehemently denied involvement. On March 14, Martyrs' Square became a human sea of demonstrators: Muslims, Druze and Christians alike, demanding the \"truth.\" But Hariri's death also exposed the fault lines that had broken Lebanon a generation previously. Even after it withdrew its troops, Syria still had allies in Lebanon. One was Hezbollah, accused of the suicide attacks that had killed scores of U.S. Marines in Beirut more than 20 years previously. Another was Gen. Michel Aoun; now back from exile, the same Michel Aoun who had defied Syria in 1989, but who now made common cause with Hezbollah against his fellow Christians. Earlier this year I visited Martyrs' Square. The spirit of the Cedar Revolution had evaporated. The place looked like a morgue. Anti-government Hezbollah squatters had brought life there to a standstill. As I passed through, business owners stood silent in the sun and shook their heads at me in despair. I wondered if they sensed my disappointment, my pain at watching Beirut bleed again. Lebanon's political actors now find themselves re-enacting scenes from the final act of the civil war 19 years ago. Once again, the term of the president is approaching its end; there is no agreement on his successor. Suspicion and fear are the political currency of the day. And the questions haunts me: Will the country's brief renaissance that so amazed me in 1995 be snuffed out by the old curse of sectarian rivalries? E-mail to a friend .

Firefighters battle the Witch fire Tuesday in the Del Dios area of Escondido, California. The blazes have killed one person and injured at least 70 more. Firefighters were aided by resources from Mexico, the state and federal governments and even inmates from California's prisons. San Diego Fire Department Battalion Chief Bruce Cartelli described scenes of \"utter devastation\" with hundreds of homes lost and \"many hundreds\" of others damaged. \"It's probably the worst significant event in my career of 36 years,\" he said. \"It will not end ... until it reaches the ocean or the winds turn around,\" Cartelli said. Meteorologists suggested that Santa Ana winds, which have fueled the wildfires with some gusts approaching 100 mph, could die down Wednesday afternoon. \"We are still facing some very serious fires,\" Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said after an aerial tour of the affected area. \"The weather has made it very difficult for the air assets to get up and fight the fires. ... If the weather cooperates, maybe we can turn the tide tomorrow.\" Officials have evacuated nearly 350,000 homes in San Diego County alone, where the worst of the fires are blazing. Using U.S. Census Bureau numbers from the 2000 census, that could mean as many as 950,000 were affected by the fires.  Watch evacuees shaken, firefighters battling \u00bb . In San Diego County, at least half a million residents had been ordered to find refuge in shelters, schools and stadiums as fires pushed into new areas. Among the evacuees as more than 4,000 military personnel from several bases in the area. With the winds pushing them across the area, the fires spread quickly, forcing some residents to flee in the middle of the night. \"My wife woke me up like 12 o'clock, screaming and yelling that the flames were coming down,\" said Johnny Villanueva of Spring Valley, who fled with his wife and daughter to San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium, which is serving as a shelter to more than 12,000 evacuees. \"We just loaded up the car really quick and came down here ... slept in our vehicles.\" His wife, Elizabeth, added, \"I saw on the mountain on fire, and said, 'Oh my God, my family. ... Let's go.\" With Qualcomm Stadium being used by the evacuees, the San Diego Chargers planned to practice at the Arizona Cardinals' stadium in Glendale for next weekend's game. Lake Arrowhead resident Michelle Dresser, who owns a business and was chased from her home by a wildfire last year, said she was waiting until the last minute to leave. She spent the night in her store, partly to help customers and neighbors. \"It is crazy. We are surrounded by fire on both sides,\" she said. Asked by CNN where she would go, she replied, \"I have to find someplace to accept two dogs, two cats and a turtle.\"  Watch people staying with pets at refuge \u00bb . Animals are allowed in Qualcomm Stadium, a nearby field and Del Mar Fairgrounds and Racetrack. President Bush is scheduled to visit the area on Thursday, the White House said. Chertoff arrived in San Diego Tuesday afternoon for a \"first-hand look\" at the devastation. \"I wanted to see for myself, first of all, how the shelter situation is in San Diego, what the fires look like up close,\" Chertoff told CNN. The secretary said that the federal response to the wildfires is \"phenomenally better\" than the response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, \"because we have been preparing and planning and training together for the last 2 \u00bd years.\" \"Unlike in Katrina ... we have now built the process ... and we've rehearsed it, so when we take the field, the team already knows what we need to do,\" he said.  See photos of the fires \u00bb . And the scene at Qualcomm Stadium on Tuesday did seem to live up to Chertoff's expectations as volunteers cheerily handed out chairs, food and water. Thirty-four firefighters have been injured, authorities said. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he was \"heartbroken\" after touring the Lake Arrowhead area, where the Grass Valley and Slide fires have burned 5,000 acres and destroyed more than 200 homes. \"This is a tragedy, what is happening in California,\" he told reporters. The combination of dry terrain, searing heat and hammering winds had created \"the perfect storm for fire,\" the governor said. Schwarzenegger said about 7,000 firefighters were battling the blazes, including 2,300 inmates from California's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders said the mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, had sent four fire engines and their crews to help out, and the governor of Baja California had offered help. Chertoff said cots, blankets, water and other supplies have been moved where they are needed, and more are coming. The Federal Emergency Management Agency delivered 25,000 cots to Qualcomm early Tuesday. At least 150 National Guard members are assigned to provide security at the stadium.  See where the fires are burning \u00bb . Of San Diego County's 10 major fires, the Witch fire in the north, which has grown to 200,000 acres, is the priority because of its significant threat to structures, said Ron Lane, the county's director of emergency services. The Harris fire had burned more than 70,000 acres by mid-morning. In northern Los Angeles County, the Ranch, Buckweed, and Magic fires have charred more than 93,000 acres and fire officials fear they could merge. \"We want to keep these fires as small as we can,\" said Capt. Barry Parker of the Ventura County Fire Department. The 54,500-acre Ranch fire was only two miles away from the 1,200-acre Magic fire. The blazes are straddling the L.A.-Ventura County line. Asked if he had enough resources, Parker said, \"We truly don't.\" \"We're using a limited amount of resources to go in and fight these fires,\" he said. \"We've got about 600 people on the Ranch fire; we normally would have about 1,500. \"So we have to be absolutely surgical in how we plan and how we tactically use our fire equipment because we just simply don't have enough fire engines in the state of California to battle these blazes.\" In San Diego County, a utility spokesman said a 500,000-volt transmission line was damaged when the Harris fire expanded, and it will be out of service until at least Wednesday. Other transmission lines have been destroyed. Sanders said Mexico's Federal Electrical Commission was providing power to the area's grid to help make up for the losses. California also received extensive offers of manpower and equipment from the military. A total of 550 Marines were ready for deployment from Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego, and 67 Defense Department employees -- 12 firefighting teams -- already were engaged. Eleven Defense Department helicopters equipped with water buckets and more than 17,000 National Guardsmen were available, along with six C-130 aircraft able to drop water and flame retardant on the flames. But aerial attacks on the fires have been limited by the fierce Santa Ana winds. The Red Cross and other groups also were in the wings. They and some other groups were waiting for the flames to die down before bringing in their volunteers. The Red Cross has set up 11 shelters in the area and housed 3,000 people Monday night. More were expected Tuesday. A firefighter at Rancho Bernardo in San Diego County showed distress. \"Every one of us out here feels like these homes are our own. We know what it's like to see people's faces when they've lost everything. It's devastating to see so much of this all at once.\" E-mail to a friend .

Sallie Krawcheck has made Fortune's list of the World's Most Powerful Women every year since 2002 . That's what Sallie Krawcheck does as Chairman and Chief Executive of Citi Global Wealth Management. She joined the banking industry as a research analyst, but quickly rose through the ranks, gaining a reputation for honesty and integrity along the way. Dubbed the \"Mrs Clean\" of Wall Street, Ms Krawcheck was credited with restoring investors' faith in analyst reports while head of retail brokerage firm Smith Barney. She joined Citigroup in 2002, and spent some time as Chief Financial Officer before taking up her current role in March 2007. Sallie Krawcheck has been a regular entrant on Fortune's list of the World's Most Powerful Women in Business -- in 2007, she made number 12. John Defterios caught up with Ms Krawcheck in Dubai. He asked her for her views on the movement of capital outside the G8 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States). Sallie Krawcheck (SK): I think what's happening right now, it's fascinating because in the United States and in developed Europe we're having a liquidity crunch -- someone might argue a liquidity crisis. And in fact, we are awash with liquidity in the Middle East and in Asia as well, so there's really a bifurcation that's occurring in the world. And if you think about, oil doesn't even have to stay at the 90-plus dollar level it is; even at levels in the 70's, 60's, 50's, 40's, a tremendous amount of liquidity is being generated in these markets which is really being put back into the market. Yes, the investments are going up globally, but the governments here really are investing back in the infrastructure and the economies of this region. And so over time, you're really going to see... I think continue to see... a shift in economic activity on a relative basis from the more developed economies here to the Middle East as well as to Asia. John Defterios (JD): It's coming almost as a perfect storm; we have a sub prime crisis, a 20 percent fall in the dollar in the last two years. In this window of time, is there a danger that the financial capitals build outside of Wall Street and it undermines its role? (SK): I think there is no doubt that New York is losing its status as a financial capital of the world. If you think about some years ago, if you think about the internet bubble for example, where it was New York and California wasn't it? And you look at a whole range of reasons for it, and the sub prime crisis perhaps, the decline of the dollar perhaps. But you have overlapping regulators in the United States, you have very high taxes in the United States, you have a very litigious environment in the United States, and you have the emerging markets coming up, so capital is being raised outside of the United States. These things, some of which are negative for the United States, some of which are positive for the other regions, is accelerating a shift that was underway from New York, to London, to Hong Kong, to Singapore, and potentially to Dubai as well. (JD): Some of the wealth funds are now on the radar of both Wall Street and Capitol Hill in Washington. You can't have your cake and eat it too. You can't say I want some of that liquidity but I only want part of that liquidity. What is the result of that do you think? Can you over-regulate the sovereign funds? (SK): Oh, I think you can over-regulate the sovereign funds. I think the same question can be asked of the private equity funds and the hedge funds as well; where in a lot of countries the regulators have been struggling with the issue of 'here are very important drivers of global markets and global liquidity'. And the concern is if, gee these are going to be important going forward, we want to have these involved in our economy and our markets, but if we regulate this alone that money will skitter away to another market -- to a market outside the United States or Europe for example. (JD): It's fascinating because if you look at Qatar or Egypt or Shanghai, the stock markets have almost had like a one way path; there's been some correction here in the Middle East. But what are we likely to see here, stair steps up the ladder with some corrections along the way, or an implosion because of the rapid gains? (SK): I think you've got to separate the idea of what's going on in the real economies and what's going on in the market places. They move together, but sometimes they separate, they diverge, and they can diverge for a long period of time. If you look at economic growth potential of the Middle East, of Asia, of Latin America, we feel very bullish about this. And I was making the point earlier today, China has been growing at 11 or 12 percent, not for one year or two years, but literally for 30 years. For 30 years it's been growing at that kind of rate and really can continue as far as the eye can see. So, say the same thing for the Middle East, the growth even at a lower oil price can be significant, but can be high single digit or double digit for some foreseeable period going forward. (JD): Is Wall Street, or for that matter, London or any other financial center ready for a woman -- for example in your case, 1.4 trillion dollars of assets... (SK): 1.8 Thank you... (JD): ...to run one of the major money center banks of the world? I'm sure you're feeling this pressure even though you're young by international standards. Are we ready for a woman to take over a money center bank? (SK): Well it looks like the United States may be ready for a woman to take over as President. So I think if we're ready to potentially have a woman run the country, I think we are getting ready as a country, to potentially have a woman run a money center bank. Now, you know, the board wouldn't ask and I wouldn't accept, but if you look across Wall Street, there are a few women who are putting themselves in positions to be successors the next time there are CEO's who move along, and I think it's a very exciting development for the industry and for the country.

Firefighter Luke Perisin sets a backfire Wednesday against the Santiago Fire in Live Oak Canyon, California. The Santiago Fire in Orange County was started in two places along a little-traveled road, according to Chief Chip Prather of the county's fire authority. The fire, which has burned more than 25,000 acres, was started in brush just off Santiago Canyon Road, not close to homes. It spread rapidly, indicating the arsonist had some knowledge of winds and other factors. \"It is a confirmed arson. There was evidence found at the scene. That is the purpose of our early declaration of it being an arson-caused fire,\" Prather said. He would not describe the evidence.  Watch how the evidence points to arson \u00bb . Prather said officials originally thought the fire had three points of origin instead of two. The Santiago Fire's points of origin are considered crime scenes, said Jim Amornino, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. The reward for information leading to an arrest has increased to $250,000 -- $50,000 each from the governor's office, the U.S. agency of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the FBI, Prather said. KFI radio has chipped in another $100,000, the sheriff's department said. The state established a toll-free arson tip line at 800-540-7085. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said anyone convicted of arson would be dealt with harshly. If a suspect is to be found, \"it's going to be by a clue from the public,\" said county Sheriff Mike Corona. About 1,100 firefighters were working on controlling the Santiago Fire, which has destroyed at least 22 structures, according to Orange County Fire Battalion Chief Kris Concepcion. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the fire was only 30 percent contained Thursday morning after being 50 percent contained the day before.  Watch the Santiago flames rage \u00bb . The motive of the Santiago Fire's arsonist was a mystery to Concepcion. \"That's the part that I really can't figure out, to tell you the truth,\" he told CNN. \"That individual knew on Sunday when this fire started that we had, really, the perfect storm, if you will. We had the heavy Santa Ana winds, we had the low relative humidities, we had the high temperatures. \"And then for someone to even think about doing something as reprehensible as starting a fire where they knew the fire would grow as rapidly as it would -- traveling about three, 3\u00bd miles in about an hour -- is just really absolutely unconscionable,\" he said. The smaller Rosa Fire in Riverside County, 100 percent contained at 411 acres Thursday morning, was also probably arson, state officials said. Meanwhile, Los Angeles Fire Department investigators are looking into whether a man who was arrested on suspicion of arson in the San Fernando Valley may have had a role in any of the ongoing blazes, an L.A. police spokeswoman said. Catalino Pineda, 41, was arrested Wednesday, Officer Kate Lopez told CNN. Witnesses told police they saw him lighting a fire on a hillside in the West Hills area of San Fernando -- northwest of Los Angeles -- then walking away, Lopez said. Pineda was already on probation for \"making excessive false emergency reports\" to police at the time of the arrest, Lopez said. His bail has been set at $75,000, she said. The fire he allegedly set was brought under control, but now authorities want to find out if he had any role in the other wildfires. In San Bernardino County, John Alfred Rund, 48, was arrested Tuesday evening and charged with setting a small fire along a rural roadside near Victorville. Rund was to be arraigned Thursday morning in Victorville. He was being held in lieu of $750,000 bail. The county's district attorney's office on Thursday also filed arson charges against Anthony Riperti, 47, of Redlands. A statement from the office did not say when or where Riperti is accused of setting a fire. He is being held on $250,000 bail and will be arraigned later Thursday. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department also arrested an adult and a juvenile accused by an anonymous tipster of starting a fire in Vista in the northern part of the county. In a written statement, the sheriff's department identified the adult as Gorgonio Nava. The Vista Fire Department extinguished the blaze before it grew out of control, the statement said. Investigators have determined that the Grass Valley Fire in San Bernardino County was not caused by arson, and a preliminary investigation into the cause of the 10,152-acre Slide Fire seems to indicate arson was not a factor, sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Beaver said.

Arnold Schwarzenegger dubbed \"the perfect storm for fire\" eased Wednesday, helping firefighters gain ground against devastating Southern California wildfires. A plane drops fire retardant on the fourth day of a wildfire pushed by winds through Pauma Valley, California. Winds that gusted as much as 101 mph on Sunday dropped to about 30 mph Wednesday evening. Meanwhile, the dry Santa Ana winds that have fanned the flames, changed direction and began blowing inland from the Pacific Ocean, increasing the humidity and easing the burden on almost 8,900 firefighters in the area. But the destruction was taking its toll on the men and women on the front lines of the fires. \"It hurts us to have those homes lost. It hurts us to have those injuries. And it is frustrating for us to watch our community be devastated by this,\" said firefighter Andy Menshek. As conditions improved, officials allowed people to return to communities that had been off-limits because of intense flames and dense smoke. \"It was home,\" said Mark Davis, whose two-story Rancho Bernardo house burned to the ground. \"It was us. We had been there 28 years, and it had a lot of our flavor.\" The change in the weather also meant that firefighting aircraft -- grounded for most of the week by the winds -- could finally fly. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Capt. Scott McLean called the droning sound of aircraft the \"sound of joy.\" \"Their drops are hitting their mark because the wind is not there,\" he said. The rate of burning had slowed significantly by Wednesday. Still, the fire damage increased to 434,543 acres, said Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Watch Schwarzenegger give a progress report \u00bb . That amounted to 679 square miles, or about 10 times the size of Washington, D.C. By Wednesday evening, the largest fire -- the Witch in northern San Diego County -- was 10 percent contained. It burned about 196,000 acres before combining with the smaller Poomacha blaze. Seven fires among the 22 counted Wednesday were contained.  See where the fires are burning \u00bb . Others, such as the Buckweed Fire in Los Angeles County, were as much as 94 percent contained. One large fire was a suspected arson. The FBI and the Orange County Fire Authority are investigating the Santiago fire that has burned more than 19,000 acres. All three of its points of origin have been declared crime scenes, said Jim Amornino, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. A $70,000 reward is being offered for any information leading to the arrest of those responsible for setting the fire. The blaze was about 50 percent contained after destroying 17 structures.  Watch the raging flames of the Santiago fire \u00bb . The smaller Rosa fire in Riverside County, 70 percent contained at just over 400 acres, was also a probably arson, state officials said. As the fire danger eased, residents were allowed to return to several neighborhoods surrounding San Diego: Del Mar Highlands, Encinitas, Solana Beach, Carmel Valley, Chula Vista and Otay Mesa. Helicopters were back in the air over the Lake Arrowhead, California, area after all air activity had been suspended because of extremely smoky skies. In nearby Running Springs, CNN's Ted Rowlands stood in the midst of charred, smoldering rubble strewn with potentially deadly power lines. \"It will be a while before these people will come back. When they do come back, unfortunately they'll have this pretty much to look at,\" he said Wednesday.  Watch Rowlands describe a major battle with the flames \u00bb .

Now you can see the flames just basically burning themselves out,\" said Rowlands. The fires have already destroyed 1,664 structures -- including 1,436 homes -- and they still threaten 25,000 more, Schwarzenegger said Wednesday. The blazes have killed three people and left 40 hurt, he said. The governor will fly over the area Thursday with President Bush, who signed a major disaster declaration Wednesday.

An undated amateur photo of Gillian Gibbons, who has been found guilty of insulting religion. Gillian Gibbons also faces deportation from Sudan after her prison term, her lawyer told CNN. He said that he was \"very disappointed\" with the verdict and that Gibbons planned to appeal. Gibbons was not convicted of two other charges brought against her -- inciting hatred and showing contempt for religious beliefs, her lawyer said. Gibbons, 54, was arrested Sunday after she asked her class of 7-year-olds in Khartoum to name the stuffed animal as part of a school project, the British Foreign Office said. She had faced charges under Article 125 of Sudan's constitution, the law relating to insulting religion and inciting hatred. Although there is no ban in the Quran on images of Allah or the Prophet Mohammed, Islam's founder, likenesses are considered highly offensive by Muslims.  Watch latest developments in the case. \u00bb . Appearing somber and dazed, Gibbons arrived at the central courthouse in Khartoum for her closed hearing early Thursday. A staff member from the British Embassy in Khartoum and defense lawyers attended the hearing with her. The courthouse was heavily guarded by police, who kept journalists -- and, for a while, even one of her attorneys -- away. Gibbons could have faced a sentence of 40 lashes, a fine, or a jail term of up to a year, according to the Foreign Office, which expressed Britain's dissatisfaction with the verdict. \"We are extremely disappointed that the charges against Gillian Gibbons were not dismissed,\" Foreign Secretary David Miliband said in a statement issued shortly after the verdict was announced. \"As I said this morning, our clear view is that this is an innocent misunderstanding by a dedicated teacher. Our priority now is to ensure Ms. Gibbons' welfare, and we will continue to provide consular assistance to her. I have called in the Sudanese ambassador, Omer Siddig, this evening to explain the decision and discuss next steps.\"  Watch a report on reactions to the verdict \u00bb . The Foreign Office said Gibbons would be given credit for the four days since her arrest, meaning that the she has 11 days remaining on her sentence. Earlier, Miliband had met with Siddig, who was summoned to the Foreign Office in London. \"I explained to him that we were very concerned by the case. We believe that this was an innocent misunderstanding,\" Miliband said in a statement released Thursday after the meeting. \"The Sudanese ambassador undertook to ensure our concerns were relayed to Khartoum at the highest level. He also said he would reflect back to Khartoum the real respect for the Islamic religion in this country,\" the statement added. On the first floor of the courthouse, around 25 police linked arms and forced journalists and British officials away from the court entrance. Police detained some journalists, and confiscated a camera belonging to a freelance CNN cameraman. Four vans filled with riot police were waiting outside the courthouse, but there were no signs of street disturbances or protests. Staff from Gibbons' school, including Robert Boulos, the head of Unity High School, were present. The staff members refused to comment on their colleague's predicament. On Wednesday, Boulos said he was \"horrified\" when he found out that the complaint about the naming of the bear came from a member of his own staff -- not from a parent, as originally thought. Defense counsel later confirmed that the complaint came from Sarah Khawad, a secretary at the school. Gibbons has been working at the school -- popular with wealthy Sudanese and expatriates -- since August, after leaving her position as deputy head teacher at a primary school in Liverpool, England, this summer, Boulos said. He said Gibbons asked the children to pick their favorite name for the new class mascot, which she was using to aid lessons about animals and their habitats. E-mail to a friend .

Chip Auman said his 18-year-old daughter survived the fire but was hospitalized and in stable condition because of complications from smoke inhalation. \"The thought of losing a child is unimaginable to me, and as a father my heart goes out to the families that lost a loved one in this situation,\" he said. Auman said the situation was \"hard to fathom.\" \"There's just no words to describe what we've been going through,\" he said, asking for prayers for survivors and the families of those who died. \"We're numb, we're confused, we're heartbroken.\" Two college campuses mourned Monday. Six University of South Carolina students and a Clemson University student died in the fire early Sunday morning in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina. Six other South Carolina students were able to get out of the house in time. The six were treated and released from nearby Brunswick Community Hospital, but Auman's daughter was hospitalized again in Hartsville, South Carolina. Authorities from the state Bureau of Investigation and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are leading the investigation into the cause of the fire. Ocean Isle Beach Mayor Debbie Smith said the house was \"engulfed\" in flames when the fire department arrived on the scene, about five minutes after being notified.

The university did not cancel classes on Monday, but Pruitt said arrangements had been made for those who need to go home or stay out of class at the 28,000-student campus. Pruitt said meetings had been held Sunday with members of Delta Delta Delta sorority and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. The South Carolina students were affiliated with those houses, he said, although he stressed that the weekend was not an official Greek function. He also said counselors and ministers were available to help students deal with the loss of their classmates.

This is her story of life with diabetes. Ann Curley uses a pump attached to a catheter in her body to monitor glucose levels and administer insulin. (CNN) -- When I was 7 years old, my mom took me to the doctor because I had lost a lot of weight, despite a voracious appetite. My family had just moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to Pasadena, California, and this visit to the doctor's office was my introduction to a man who would come to have a huge impact on my life. His name was Dr. Robert Deputy, and he was the pediatrician who diagnosed me with diabetes. He spoke to me directly, rather than to my mother, and he asked me questions: Did I feel thirsty? Did I need to urinate during the night? The answer to both questions was yes. He asked for a urine sample and the result was immediate. Dr. Deputy told me and my mother that my body wasn't processing sugar properly. I had diabetes. That is how my 40-year journey with diabetes began. I was checked into a hospital to learn how to test my urine for sugar, give myself injections of insulin, follow a diabetic diet and control my diabetes. I spent several days in the hospital learning how to manage my disease, and then they sent me home. Dr. Deputy would call our house each afternoon to check on me and see how I was doing. Much to my parents' chagrin -- and to my delight -- he wanted me to be self sufficient and responsible for monitoring myself. I refused to let my parents give me injections or test my urine. This demand for self sufficiency turned out to be one of my best life lessons, and not just for managing my diabetes. While some diabetics may feel their disease is a burden, I feel that being diagnosed with diabetes was a blessing in disguise. It forced our family to eat healthily, and it taught me about good nutrition -- something I practice every day. I know carbohydrate counts in most foods, and I understand dietary concepts that most people don't even care about. Being active is also a way to burn off high blood sugar, so when my urine tested positive for glucose, my older sister Robin was in charge of exercising me. We had countless jump-rope contests, bike rides and roller-skating excursions, keeping me and my three sisters active and fit. And I felt like a little mad scientist, using a test tube with drops of water, urine and fizzy tablets to see if there was sugar in my urine. Fortunately, over time, technology improved. First, test strips were developed that could be dipped in urine to reveal whether sugar was present in it. But the truth is, testing urine for sugar was a primitive method. By the time sugar gets into the urine, it's a signal that the body doesn't have enough insulin to process sugar. And the urine test didn't give an actual number for the amount of sugar in the urine. It simply gave a color reading that corresponded with a range of how much sugar was present in the urine. Inaccurate was really an understatement when you talk about urine testing. Home blood glucose testing kits became available in the early 1980s, and they were a huge move toward precise control and management of diabetes. With the kit, the diabetic uses a device to poke a finger and produce a drop of blood. The blood is placed on a test strip that fits into a device that produces a reading of the blood glucose within seconds. While I initially balked at the idea of pricking my finger several times a day, now I can't imagine not doing it in order to monitor what my blood sugar is doing. The 1980s also saw the advent of the insulin pump. This device is the size of a pager and contains a reservoir filled with insulin. The reservoir connects to a tube that infuses the insulin into the body with a tiny plastic shunt. So rather than taking multiple injections to mimic the body's insulin patterns, the pump drips insulin into the body to keep blood sugars constant, then gives extra amounts with meals. Another life-altering development in diabetes, which I have discovered in the last year, is the continuous glucose monitor, or CGM. This is a small device inserted into the tissue -- usually the abdomen, hip or leg -- and it has a tiny sensor that reads the glucose level of the body's fluids. The data is transmitted to a receiver, and patients can see a constant reading of their blood sugar levels. I have participated in clinical trials for three different CGM devices, and I found them all to be quite accurate. Some sensors transmit data directly to an insulin pump, so you can use the reading to adjust and fine-tune the amount of insulin being pumped into the body. The patient still has to test his or her blood sugar to confirm the sensor is properly calibrated, but it's amazing to be able to see constant readings and graphs of what your blood sugar is doing and better manage blood sugars. CGM technology is a step toward the ultimate goal of controlling type I diabetes using what's called a \"closed loop system.\" This means diabetics someday will be able to wear a pump that gathers data from a sensor so precise that the pump can be programmed to act on its own and make adjustments all by itself. The current systems are \"open looped,\" meaning the diabetic controls when the doses are given. The goal is to eventually create a pump that is more like a robotic delivery system, and all the patient has to do is wear it. Once that technology is perfected, this type of device would be implanted, which would be the next best thing to not having diabetes. I mentioned to my sister Robin that I had tracked down Dr. Deputy for this article. She told me something I didn't know when I was 7. Forty years ago, before the advent of all of the cool diabetes technology such as insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitors and blood sugar testing, parents were given a fairly grim prediction for how their child would fare. Dr. Deputy told my parents that I would probably only live to the age of 20 or 30, which apparently -- but not surprisingly -- had the whole family freaked out. I spoke with Dr. Deputy, who recently retired from his pediatric practice, and he seemed to remember me. When I asked him about his dismal prognosis for my survival, he said sadly, \"At that time, that was what we told parents back then. ... Everything changes with time -- diabetes, leukemia -- technology has changed with the pump and the equipment.\" I think he was relieved that his prognosis was wrong. I know that I certainly am. In fact, I am hoping to live another 40 years!

Gravell won 23 caps for Wales and played on the Lions tour of South Africa in 1980. Gravell had been on holiday with his family in the Spanish Mediterranean island of Mallorca at the time. A WRU statement praised Gravell as being \"a man who epitomized the passion, flair and dignity of his beloved Welsh nation.\" Gravell made his debut for Wales against France in 1975, three years after helping his club side Llanelli to their famous win over the touring All Blacks. In all he made 23 appearances for what was then a dominant Wales side, winning Grand Slams in 1976 and 1978, and played all four Tests on the Lions' tour of South Africa in 1980. After retiring as a player in 1985, Gravell became president of Llanelli RFC and the Llanelli Scarlets. He also pursued a career as an actor and a respected rugby broadcaster. Earlier this year, Gravell had his right leg amputated below the knee following complications linked with his diabetes but he had been recovering well.

Barack Obama kicked off a series of local outreach gospel concerts Friday in Charleston, South Carolina, that unexpectedly came back to bite his campaign. Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama is competing for the black vote with Hillary Clinton. The concerts were meant to boost black voters' support for his presidential nominee bid -- the kind of events that would normally fly under the national radar. The ensuing controversy highlighted that Obama's desire to unite disparate voting blocs -- especially religious voters -- under his umbrella of \"change\" is not without some serious pitfalls. When the campaign announced the lineups for the three-city \"Embrace the Change!\" gospel tour last week, one name stood out to gay bloggers: Donnie McClurkin. The Grammy-award winning singer is on record as saying homosexuality is a choice, and that he was \"once involved with those desires and those thoughts\" but was able to get past them through prayer. To say the least, neither of those arguments is very popular in the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community. John Aravosis, a prominent gay blogger and co-founder of the Web site AmericaBlog, led the charge against the Obama campaign, writing that the Illinois Democrat was \"sucking up to anti-gay bigots\" and \"giving them a stage.\" When the story bubbled up into the mainstream media, it took the Obama campaign by surprise. Obama's efforts in the Palmetto State have overwhelmingly targeted African-American churchgoers in a bid to win over black voters in South Carolina from rival Sen. Hillary Clinton. The campaign has vigorously promoted the candidate's faith, launching \"40 Days of Faith and Family\" in September, which used Bible study groups to tap into the black electorate. Campaigners have run three radio ads, one of which called Obama a \"Christian family man,\" that aired on gospel stations across the state. Earlier this month, Obama spoke at an evangelical church in the traditionally conservative city of Greenville, where he demonstrated a casual familiarity with Christian vocabulary, telling the crowd, to much applause, that \"I am confident that we can create a kingdom right here on Earth.\" After that appearance, the Obama campaign told CNN that Republicans no longer had a choke hold on issues of faith and values. \"I think that what you're seeing is a breaking down of the sharp divisions that existed maybe during the '90s,\" Obama said. \"At least in politics, the perception was that the Democrats were fearful of talking about faith, and on the other hand you had the Republicans who had a particular brand of faith that oftentimes seemed intolerant or pushed people away.\" But on Tuesday, Obama was forced to confront the uncomfortable truth that some Christians and gays are a little more than just strange bedfellows, especially among blacks. Obama issued a statement saying, \"I strongly disagree with Reverend [Donnie] McClurkin's views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of the United States,\" and argued that it is important to confront homophobia among religious African Americans. A September poll of African Americans in South Carolina by Winthrop University and ETV showed that 62 percent of those surveyed said that \"sex between two adults of the same sex\" is \"strongly unacceptable.\" Obama held a conference call Wednesday with Joe Solomonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, and announced that the Rev. Andy Sidden, an openly gay South Carolina pastor, will appear at the same event as McClurkin on Sunday in Columbia. Solomonese was not completely assuaged. \"I spoke with Senator Barack Obama today and expressed to him our community's disappointment for his decision to continue to remain associated with Reverend McClurkin, an anti-gay preacher who states the need to 'break the curse of homosexuality,'\" he said in a statement. \"There is no gospel in Donnie McClurkin's message for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people and their allies. That's a message that certainly doesn't belong on any presidential candidate's stage.\" The State newspaper in Columbia reported Friday that Obama organized a conference call Thursday night with gay and lesbian leaders. After the call, the South Carolina Gay and Lesbian Pride Movement announced it will hold a protest vigil outside Sunday's concert in Columbia. Privately, Obama aides say they believe Obama is a candidate of real, transformational change, and that uproars like the McClurkin controversy are necessary speed bumps on the road to bringing people with opposing viewpoints together to air their differences. Will Obama's refusal to kick McClurkin off the concert bill hurt him? Like many political squabbles, despite the national story, it depends how much the controversy resonates with voters in those crucial early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. And in South Carolina, where African Americans make up about half of Democratic primary-goers, voters might not have a problem with McClurkin at all.

U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says that \"people need to serve where they are needed.\" Rice was responding to foreign service officers' objections to the possibility of \"directed assignments\" in Iraq. The issue has caused an uproar in the State Department, resulting in a contentious town hall-style meeting Wednesday. The new directives would be needed if enough qualified foreign service officers don't step forward to fill open positions at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. If the State Department enforces directed assignments, it will be the first time since the Vietnam War era. One official called the order to serve in Iraq \"a potential death sentence\" during the town meeting. The State Department already has begun notifying about 200 people considered prime candidates. Those chosen will be given 10 days to respond, according to last week's announcement. Unless they have a valid medical reason to refuse, those who decline could face dismissal, it said. Wednesday's heated meeting was replayed on an internal State Department television channel in Washington several times and talked about widely. Some at the hourlong meeting questioned why they were not told of the policy change directly, learning about it instead from news organizations last week.  Watch the diplomats exchange angry words \u00bb . \"I just have no respect for the whole process because you've demonstrated a lack of respect for your own colleagues,\" said foreign service officer Jack Croddy. \"Thank you for that comment. It's full of inaccuracies, but that's OK,\" Harry Thomas Jr., director general of the foreign service, shot back. Others pointed out the risks of such assignments, considering the dangers of a war zone, lack of security and regular rocket attacks on U.S. personnel. Rice, who did not attend the meeting, tried to calm things down Friday by underscoring the State Department's attempts to do \"everything that we can to try and protect our diplomats.\" However, she said, \"This is one of the highest priority tasks of the United States, and we're going to meet our obligations.\" Speaking to reporters en route to Turkey and the Mideast, she said, \"I don't know if we will have direct assignments or not, but we are one foreign service, and people need to serve where they are needed.\" The secretary sent out a cable to State Department employees worldwide encouraging them to serve in Iraq. \"This year [U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker] has identified the need for additional positions to more effectively accomplish our mission in Iraq,\" Rice said in the cable. Rice said she has decided to go forward with the identification of  officers to serve, \"should it prove necessary to direct assignments.\" \"Should others step forward, as some already have, we will fill these new jobs as we have before -- with volunteers. However, regardless of how the jobs may be filled, they must be filled,\" she said. Rice earlier said reports that the State Department was finding it hard to coax foreign service employees into Iraq \"couldn't be further from the truth.\" The assignments are new positions. Fifteen people have stepped forward to volunteer for Iraq service since the new policy was announced October 26, department spokesman Sean McCormack said. McCormack rejected comments by Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, that State Department employees are \"nervous Nellies\" and that wounded U.S. military veterans should be asked to fill the Iraq vacancies. McCormack said until now the State Department has been successful in filling jobs in Iraq with volunteers. Since 2003, more than 1,500 personnel have volunteered to go to Iraq, he said. But with the expansion of the staff in Iraq this year, 58 spots were left open. \"They are serving in dangerous and challenging places,\" he said. \"We have a lot of brave people who are stepping up to the plate in Anbar and Basra and Baghdad and Kabul and a lot of other places that are not necessarily in the headlines.\" State Department employees have been killed in Iraq, but McCormack could not say how many.

Prom, she says, was a nightmare. \"I had to go to three different stores to buy a dress,\" Pless said. \"I had to buy the biggest, also the ugliest, prom dress the store had because it was the only one that would fit.\" After high school, she lost 50 pounds. But because she hadn't done it in a healthy way, her weight crept back up to 220 pounds. At 28, she started having trouble breathing and doctors told her the weight was to blame. She reached her breaking point. \"I remember being heavy and feeling like being fit just wasn't something I could be,\" said Pless. \"I remember feeling like even if I tried, it wasn't something my body was capable of.\" Despite her doubts, Pless decided to do something. Fortunately she didn't have to look far for inspiration.  See before and after weight loss photos from CNN.com I-Reporters \u00bb . \"My manager at the Kennedy Space Center ran marathons, and he was the same age as my father,\" she said. Because her own father had diabetes and was in poor health, he seemed much older, she said. Over the next three to four months, she began walking, without any real goal or expectation. Pless believed that if she just focused on eating less and moving more, everything would fall into place. \"At first, it was hard to start exercising because I was worried people would make fun of me,\" Pless said. \"But then I just told myself, if that's the worst that could happen ... I just got out there and didn't care.\" Eventually, she started to run or \"shuffle\" as she jokingly recalls. She also adopted an \"eat to live\" philosophy and satisfied her cravings for sweets by eating lots of fruit. \"I changed how I felt about food and what it meant to me,\" said Pless, who occasionally indulges in a bite of birthday cake or a piece of chocolate. \"One of the first things I cut out was cakes and cookies. That was my weak spot. After a few months of cutting those things out, I focused more on portion control,\" said Pless. \"I pretty much eat when I'm hungry and don't eat when I'm not and really try to pay attention to when those times are. Make sure I'm not eating out of boredom or [at] social events, I try to make sure I'm not overeating, just because everyone else is.\"  Kelly Pless shares her weight loss secrets \u00bb . Pless pays close attention to societal pressure, which she believes is the reason many people overeat. Restaurant servings are about three times bigger than a normal portion size, she says. She makes sure she doesn't overeat when dining out simply because the food is there. \"What's hard is to change how you feel about foods that you love or that aren't necessarily good for you, or actually change how you look at food. That was the hardest part for me.\" Instead of giving in to the temptation or convenience of calorie-laden or fatty foods such as cheeseburgers from the drive-through, Pless asks herself, \"What do I really want to eat? Or, what does my body really want right now?\" All of the hard work and determination paid off. Pless has lost 95 pounds and kept it off for 1\u00bd years. As a result, she says, she's healthier and more confident. She's also set a new professional goal -- to pursue a doctorate in food and exercise psychology -- so she can help others who are battling obesity and eating disorders. \"[The] negative side to weight loss is that people treat people differently. Being fat was a good filter -- I'm automatically treated better by people because I'm thinner. Society is so hard on people who are overweight or obese,\" said Pless. \"Now, those people think I'm funnier or smarter.\" Pless runs about 40 miles a week while she trains for two marathons she plans to run this winter. The first is in November in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the second is in Miami, Florida, in January. Forty pounds ago, the first thing she wanted to do once she lost the weight was to have a tummy tuck to remove all of the loose skin. But now, she said she can't imagine taking the break from running that recovering from surgery would require. \"Running has become a constant for me and does so much more for me than maintain my weight, which is now about 125 pounds,\" said Pless.  If her past is any indication of her future success, Pless will certainly cross the finish line.  I-Report: Have you lost weight?

Making history: the first double bed on a commercial jet . On board were nearly 500 passengers who had bid thousands of dollars for the historical experience. This was a turning point in aviation history as Airbus' superjumbo became the world's largest aircraft. And the time had finally come for it to receive some admiration. Singapore Airlines' CEO, Chew Choon Seng named the jetliner the \"queen of the skies\". Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus said he would like to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary on one of its double beds. And CNN's Richard Quest, who was on board the maiden flight, said there was \"nothing quite like it\". The luxury on board, he said, sets a new standard for air travel. It's the quietest large passenger jet ever built (inside and out), it has a low fuel-burn to reduce fuel use and emissions, it can carry 40 percent more passengers than other large aircraft and in greater comfort. But the feature that has attracted greatest interest on the Singapore Airlines A380 is its ''beyond first class\" cabins. Behind the sliding doors of the Singapore Airlines Suites, the well-heeled can luxuriate in a private cabin designed by leading French yacht designer, Jean-Jacques Coste. There's a wide leather seat and alongside that, a standalone bed. This is two meters long with Givenchy duvets and cushions. And for couples traveling, the beds on the middle two suites can be converted into double beds. From bed or chair, travelers can catch a movie on a 23-inch widescreen LCD. Laptops can be plugged into an in-seat power supply and business travelers with just a thumb drive can plug this into a USB ports and access a suite of office tools on Singapore Airlines' in-flight entertainment system. Celebrity chefs including Britain's Gordon Ramsay and Georges Blanc were behind the first class menu that can be eaten off Givenchy tableware. Unlike other airlines, that have considered offering casinos, gyms and showers on their future A380s, Singapore Airlines has opted instead for a configuration that, whilst offering luxury, also makes money. As Chew Choon Seng, CEO of Singapore Airlines reminded reporters last week, the first Boeing 747s soon ditched the lounges and bars on the upper decks in favor of seats that could generate cash. Behind the 12 luxury suites there are 399 economy seats, ranked 10-abreast on the upper and lower decks, as well as 60 business class seats that are the biggest yet at 87 centimeters wide. Singapore Airlines has ordered 19 superjumbos for an estimated price tag of $5.7 billion. The second is due to arrive next February with further deliveries later in 2008. Tickets for the A380's first return commercial flight between Singapore and Sydney were sold at auction on eBay. One passenger paid $100,000 for the experience, with the majority paying between $1,500 and $5,000. The $1.4 million raised has gone to charities in Singapore, Sydney and a global humanitarian organization. From Sunday 28 October, Singapore Airlines will commence its scheduled service between Singapore and Sydney on one of the three daily flights in each direction. The jetliner to be delivered next spring will be used on one of the three daily flights between Singapore and London's Heathrow Airport. It's been a long road to this point for Airbus, but the journey is by no means over. The airline has a tough delivery schedule ahead to fulfil its 185 orders to 15 customers (see figures below). Next year it plans to deliver 13, a further 25 in 2009 and 45 in 2010. Tom Enders, Airbus' CEO doesn't underestimate the scale of challenge ahead. \"This is not a piece of cake,\" he told CNN, \"but we have learned our lessons and we are very confident today that we can deliver to our customers.\" It hasn't just been Airbus that has been frantically preparing for the A380 launch. Airports around the world have had to make changes to runways and gates, as well as buy in new vehicles that can tow the giant aircraft and lift high enough to its upper decks. Seventy airports are now ready, Airbus has said. Singapore's Changi Airport, home to the Singapore Airlines A380 fleet, was the first, and when its new Terminal 3 opens early next year, 19 gates across the three terminals will be A380-ready with aerobridge access to both decks. Heathrow's new Terminal 5 will be able to handle four A380s at one time. British Airways, the Terminal's sole occupant, recently confirmed an order for 12 superjumbos and it now wants BAA to upgrade a satellite building to be built next to Terminal 5 to accommodate them. As Willie Walsh, BA's CEO told CNN, \"we want to make sure that development is built with the A380 in mind.\" But whether the arrival of the A380 sets a standard for future air travel is still undecided. As CNN's Richard Quest points out, while these giant airplanes may be suitable for getting large numbers of people between key destinations quickly, demand could be even higher for the medium-size jets such as Boeing's up-coming 787 Dreamliner. As Richard Quest says, \"there's no doubt the A380 will sell, but it is going to take a long time to reach the 420 sales which is the amount Airbus needs to make money.\" But those worries, he adds, are for another day.

Iran is the only country still flying the F-14 Tomcat. The department said the United States will tighten monitoring of export licenses and increase export restrictions on technologies that could have both civilian and military applications and could pose a danger to U.S. national security in the hands of terrorists or potential enemies. \"China and Iran pose particular U.S. export control concerns,\" the Justice Department said in a statement issued Thursday. \"Recent prosecutions have highlighted illegal exports of stealth missile technology, military aircraft components, naval warship data, night vision equipment, and other restricted technology destined for China or Iran.\" Representatives of more than a half dozen federal agencies will jointly announce their plans at a Justice Department news conference Thursday. Officials plan to highlight two recent cases. In the past week a Pittsburgh company, SparesGlobal Inc., was sentenced for lying about an illegal export of products that can be used in nuclear reactions and in the nose cones of ballistic missiles. The products ended up in Pakistan after being routed from the United Arab Emirates. In Utah, two men were charged last week with attempting to illegally export restricted components for F-4 and F-14 fighter jets. F-14 components are widely sought by Iran, which is the only military in the world that still flies the jet. E-mail to a friend .

The UK political elite boycotted events. Demonstrators lined the Mall. The UK foreign secretary pulled out of a meeting with his Saudi counterpart to be with his new adopted son. And just days before he arrived, the Saudi King accused British officials of ignoring information that could have averted the terror attacks in London on July 2005. Whether the politics of the event were a success is open to debate. But this was just part of the story. The Saudis were also in town to cement a strong trading and business relationship that has developed between the two Kingdoms over the last 20 years. Saudi Arabia is the UK's largest trading partner in the Middle East. And behind the USA, the UK is the second largest foreign investor in the Kingdom. UK Trade & Investment has designated Saudi Arabia one of its 17 \"High Growth Markets\" along with UAE and Qatar in the region. As the nation diversifies its economy away from oil, commercial opportunities for UK thrive in a variety of sectors. Saudi Arabia is currently planning six privately-developed economic cities. The $26.6 billion King Abdullah Economic City -- the largest of these -- will create one million jobs and home to two million residents. The aim, says the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority, is to boost the economy by creating a pro-business environment, and attracting investors and fostering investment opportunities. The UK has, since the early 1990s, been one of the top five exporters to Saudi Arabia, behind USA, Germany, China and Japan. In 2007, Saudi Arabian bank SABB predicts that UK exports to the Kingdom will increase by more than 5.5 per cent to reach $2.8 billion. While the balance of trade continues to be favor of the British, Saudi Arabia's exports to Britain are also gaining ground and closing the trade gap. This year, exports to Britain are expected to reach a record high of $2.1 billion, says SABB. And this isn't all about oil. In the 1980s, three quarters of Saudi exports to the UK were from oil, but today the non-oil sector accounts for 59 percent of exports. Products being shipped to the UK include machinery, transport equipment, plastics, non-metallic minerals and, despite the UK's dominance in the sector, chemicals. According to SABB, there are also more than 150 Saudi-British joint ventures underway with a value of around $15 billion. As John Sfakianakis, chief economist from SABB says, state visits such as this are important for bolstering trade talks, past and future. \"The biggest deal that will mark their relationship in trade is the purchase of 72 Eurofighter Typhoon Jets that was sealed last week,\" says Sfakianakis. The contract between the Kingdom and the UK Ministry of Defence via BAE is worth over almost $10 billion for the aircraft alone and a further $19 billion for the deployment, maintenance and training. This comes less than a year after the UK government decided to call off a Serious Fraud Office investigation into defense contracts with Saudi Arabia. This probe related to the sale of weapons by BAE Systems to Saudi Arabia in the 1980s. BAE has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and making payments to Saudi royals to win business. But as Sfakianakis points out, any political sensitivity surrounding the visit is unlikely to harm future trading relationships between the nations. \"The relationship is far deeper than that,\" he says. \"Saudi Arabia's economy is booming and the opportunities businessmen see here are immense. Everything else takes a subsidiary part in that.\" E-mail to a friend .", "59a9e7cad1c4c873738dda62b7e7b39bc2553710": "(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of Congolese refugees fled camps Tuesday in the Democratic Republic of Congo as rebel troops attacked government forces in the area, the U.N. refugee agency said. Refugees move along a road Tuesday in Mugunga, near Goma, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A press release from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it didn't appear rebels had targeted the camps, but it reported some were looted after camp residents, classified as internally displaced persons, fled. Roads to Goma, about 10 miles from the camps, were crowded with refugees and local residents fleeing the fighting, the UNHCR reported. Torrential rain made the movement even more difficult. \"The main road toward Sake was crowded with people; we had difficulties getting through,\" UNHCR field safety adviser Pierre Nazroo was quoted as saying in the agency's release. \"Internally displaced people are moving from site to site, direction Goma.\" UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said, \"They have been living in extremely difficult conditions anyway. Now they have nothing but what they can carry.\" Redmond added, \"These are people in poor health; they are soaking wet because of the torrential downpours. They need shelter, they need water, they need a lot of assistance so we're going to have to move quickly to get that help to them because a lot of them are already in a weakened state.\" While the Congolese government accused troops under rebel general Laurent Nkunda of staging the attack, a Nkunda spokesman denied the allegation, according to a report from the Integrated Regional Information Networks, a U.N.-affiliated news service. The spokesman, Bwambale Kakolele, said Rwandan Hutu rebels who also operate in the area were behind the attack, that report said. A spokesman for the U.N. military mission in the Congo said it was uncertain which group attacked the Congo army outpost near the village of Kishangazi, according to the U.N.-affiliated news service. \"We think it could have been insurgents close to Nkunda who attacked, but we cannot rule out the [Rwandan rebels],\" spokesman Col. Pierre Cherayron was quoted as saying. The UNHCR identified the affected camps as Mugunga I, Mugunga II, Lac Vert and Bulengo, saying about 28,000 had abandoned the first three camps and about 2,000 had left Bulengo. The UNHCR said 375,000 Congolese in North Kivu province have been forced from their homes in the past year. In the past two months alone, 160,000 have fled their homes amid the fighting between renegade troops and government forces, the agency said. North Kivu is in eastern Congo near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda. Congolese President Joseph Kabila has tried to gain a cease-fire with the rebels in the area under Nkunda, but fighting continues as hard-liners among the rebels and in the government have blocked reconciliation efforts, according to the International Crisis Group, an nongovernmental organization looking for solutions to conflicts.

Genarlow Wilson tells CNN on Sunday that he will be more conservative and alert in the future. The 21-year-old, who served two years of a 10-year sentence for aggravated child molestation, said the prospect of being labeled a sex offender drove him to turn down the deal. He had to think about his 9-year-old sister and having a family of his own one day, he said Sunday. \"It might've been lesser time, but then again, I would have nowhere to go because I would have no home,\" Wilson said during a CNN interview scheduled to air Monday at 8 p.m. \"I wouldn't be able to stay with my mother because I have a little sister. You know, when you're a sex offender you can't be around kids. Basically, I can't even have kids myself, you know, so what is the point of life?\" he asked. In 2005, a jury found Wilson guilty of aggravated child molestation for having oral sex with a 15-year-old girl at a 2003 New Year's Eve party. Wilson was 17 at the time of the party.  Watch Wilson say why he rejected the plea deal \u00bb . The conviction carried a 10-year mandatory prison sentence and a sex offender designation. According to Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker, prosecutors in Douglas County, Georgia, offered Wilson a plea deal that would have reduced his sentence, possibly to time served, and would have eventually removed the conviction and sex offender status from his record. Defense attorney B.J. Bernstein said in June that Wilson rejected the deal because he didn't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15-year sentence. The state Legislature last year amended the law under which Wilson was convicted, making such sexual encounters misdemeanors. However, the Legislature did not make the law retroactive, so it had no effect on Wilson's sentence. Now 21, Wilson was released Friday after the state Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that the young man's sentence \"constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\" Wilson said Sunday he feels no \"negative energy\" toward District Attorney David McDade, who fought efforts to have Wilson's sentence reduced. Instead, Wilson said, he is focused on the future and hopes to soon immerse himself in his college studies. He wants to major in sociology, he said, \"because I feel like I've been living my major.\" The new Genarlow Wilson will be more conservative, more alert and more appreciative of the blessings bestowed upon him, he said. \"When it seems like you have everything, you know, you feel like you have no worries until it's all gone, and I know what it feels like to be without and I don't want to ever feel like that again,\" said the former honor student, football star and homecoming king. \"I don't ever want to see the inside of a prison or a prison, period.\" Though he called his sentence \"absurd,\" Wilson said he understands that prosecutors \"were doing their job and they felt they were carrying out the law.\" Wilson also said he knows what he did was foolish. \"I was young then. I did some idiotic things in my teen years, but you know, every average teen does,\" he said. \"I don't think any of us made very wise decisions, but I don't think that any of us can go back then and change what happened.\" E-mail to a friend .", "a74c3ff540cb154fc1294fd9d48b6a952329722b": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The confirmation of Michael Mukasey as attorney general was all but assured Friday when two key Democratic senators said they will vote in favor of the nominee despite questions about his views on \"waterboarding\" and the president's power to order electronic surveillance. Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Charles Schumer of New York announced they would support the retired federal judge from New York just hours after the chairman of the Judiciary Committee announced his opposition to the nominee. Feinstein and Schumer are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is scheduled to vote on the Mukasey nomination Tuesday. If all the Republican members of the committee also vote for Mukasey, which is expected, his nomination will go before the full Senate. A leading Democrat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday Mukasey is likely to be confirmed if his nomination passes the Judiciary Committee. Schumer had praised the nomination of Mukasey as a consensus candidate when the president announced Mukasey as his choice to replace former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Gonzales gave up the post in September. \"This is an extremely difficult decision,\" Schumer said. \"When an administration so political, so out of touch with the realities of governing and so contemptuous of the rule of law is in charge, we are never left with an ideal choice. Judge Mukasey is not my ideal choice. However, Judge Mukasey, whose integrity and independence is respected even by those who oppose him, is far better than anyone could expect from this administration.\" A number of Democratic senators, however, have said they will oppose Mukasey because of questions about his views on the interrogation technique called \"waterboarding\" and the president's power to order electronic surveillance. Waterboarding involves restraining a suspect and using water to produce the sensation of drowning. Mukasey told senators this week that he finds waterboarding \"repugnant,\" but he could not answer whether the technique amounts to torture. While saying \"serious questions have been raised about Judge Mukasey's views on torture and on separation of powers,\" Feinstein said she would support the nominee because the Justice Department needed fresh leadership. \"First and foremost, Michael Mukasey is not Alberto Gonzales. Rather, he has forged an independent life path as a practitioner of the law and a federal judge in the Southern District of New York. \"I believe that Judge Mukasey is the best we will get and voting him down would only perpetuate acting and recess appointments, allowing the administration to avoid the transparency that confirmation hearings provide and diminish effective oversight by Congress.\" Just hours before Feinstein and Schumer announced their decisions, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, announced he would vote against the Mukasey nomination.  Watch Sen. Leahy explain why he can't support the Mukasey nomination \u00bb . \"No American should need a classified briefing to determine whether waterboarding is torture,\" Leahy said. \"Waterboarding was used at least as long ago as the Spanish Inquisition. We prosecuted Japanese war criminals for waterboarding after World War II. \"I am eager to restore strong leadership and independence to the Department of Justice. I like Michael Mukasey. I wish that I could support his nomination. But I cannot. America needs to be certain and confident of the bedrock principle -- deeply embedded in our laws and our values -- that no one, not even the president, is above the law.\" President Bush demanded the Senate confirm Mukasey during a speech Thursday at the Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative think tank. \"In a time of war, it's vital for the president to have a full national security team in place,\" the president said. The president has equated asking Mukasey about his opinion of waterboarding with asking him about the CIA-run interrogation program, whose details are classified. Bush said the program does not violate U.S. bans on torture, but added that Mukasey \"does not want an uninformed opinion to be taken by our professional interrogators in the field as placing them in legal jeopardy.\" But Leahy said \"Judge Mukasey was not asked to evaluate any secret 'facts and circumstances.' \" \"He was asked whether waterboarding is illegal. Our law makes torture illegal, and waterboarding is torture, and it is illegal. It is frankly not dependent on any, quote, 'relevant facts and circumstances of the technique's past or proposed use,' \" he said, quoting from Mukasey's response to senators on the question. Sources with knowledge of the CIA-run interrogation program have said agents are no longer using waterboarding. But those sources have said waterboarding was used in the interrogation of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, now facing trial before a military tribunal for planning al Qaeda's 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. The practice was used by the Spanish Inquisition, Cambodia's Khmer Rouge and the World War II Japanese military, according to Human Rights Watch. It is specifically banned in U.S. law governing the treatment of prisoners by the U.S. military. E-mail to a friend .

Banksy's latest piece in East London where a passer-by claims to have taken a photo of the artist. The guerilla artist has been spray painting his stencils around Britain and further afield for over ten years. Last week ten of his original pieces were sold at Bonham's auction house in London for over $1 million, while on the other side of the city Tower Hamlets council authority pledged to remove his graffiti from its streets. From his beginnings as a graffiti artist in Bristol, England, Banksy has become the darling of the art world for his subversive and satirical public art. Depicting things such as riot police with smiley acid-house faces and camera-wielding rats, his work is now sold now by major art galleries. Lazarides Gallery in London is one of the main dealers of his work and describes him as \"a media star...but popular long before any of this high-profile activity -- simply because the people love his stuff.\" While he set out to lampoon the establishment, he has now been wholeheartedly embraced by it. Fans include Hollywood A-listers, including Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and Christina Aguilera who bought three of his prints in 2006, including one of Queen Victoria sitting on a woman's face. The recent sales of his work put him on a par with Jean-Michel Basquiat as the best-selling street artist. He is feted by art dealers and artists, including Damien Hirst, but he regularly mocks the art world that is so enthralled by him with ingenious stunts such as hanging his own work in the Tate gallery in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It took the British Museum eight days to discover the \"prehistoric\" rock painting of a man with a shopping trolley in the British Museum Banksy has hung on a wall. There is often a political message with this work, too. He left an inflatable doll dressed as a Guantanamo prisoner in Disneyland and painted a hole with blue sky on the Palestinian side of the West Bank wall. Despite the huge popularity and exposure of his work, Banksy's identity remains a mystery. As he operates on the fringes of the law with his guerilla art it makes sense, but also adds to his mystique. Some things are know: he's originally from Bristol, is around 30 years old and called Robert or Robin Banks, but it's been reported that even his parents are thought to believe that he makes his living as a painter and decorator. He continues to divide opinion as to whether his work is vandalism or public art. Veteran British art critic Brian Sewell called Banksy, \"a complete clown, and what he does has absolutely nothing to do with art.\" Bristol city council has recognized the popularity and artistic merit of his work by protecting a number of pieces around the city. Other local authorities don't feel the same way. Tower Hamlets and Hackney councils in London have pledged to remove his graffiti from their streets. His latest work painted on a wall in East London -- a man in overalls resting next to a giant flower drawn as a continuation from the double yellow lines on the road -- is thought to be the artist's response.

Naples has had problems in finding sites for municipal dumps -- now workers have stopped collecting trash. There is a popular saying here that roughly goes like this: everybody is competent enough (to find a solution) but nobody is responsible (for actually carrying it out). In many parts of the world waste disposal is a business -- and usually it is a good business. Garbage can be transformed into various sources of energy and then sold for a profit. In Naples, garbage is also good business, but in the sense that millions, if not billions, of euros have been wasted -- and nobody really knows how. The problem is as old and ugly as rotten trash. The region's dumps reached full capacity more than a decade ago, and since then a state of emergency has been declared every year. Eight different commissioners have been appointed, but they have all failed to solve the problem. State of emergency means government money: \u20ac1.8 billion (more than $2.5 billion) in emergency funds have been devolved to deal with the problem. It is still difficult to find out where or how that money has been spent. Incinerators that were supposed to be built were never finished, either because the companies in charge of constructing them could not finish the job, or else because magistrates stopped the work, pending ongoing criminal investigations into alleged mafia involvement. One Italian newspaper suggested that a good 20% of the money went to pay for the salaries of those in charge of coming up with a solution to the problem. More worrying perhaps, is another suggestion: that the local mafia, known as the Camorra, is taking advantage of the situation. As the crisis has worsened over the years, so the Camorra's profits, estimated now at around \u20ac1 billion (roughly $1.45 billion), are alleged to have increased. How does the local mafia make money? The Naples prosecutor in charge of environmental crimes says city government officials use the state of emergency to quickly award contracts which otherwise would have to be checked by complicated anti-racketeering legislation. Once they receive the money, companies linked to the underworld dispose of the waste either in the open or, ironically, at regular city dumps, even if they are overflowing. The mafia clans have now managed to burrow their way so deeply into the system that every attempt to fix the problem has proved futile. But why are citizens protesting now? Well, the government wants to re-open a previously shut dump to dispose of 3,700 tons of waste which is laying in the streets of Naples and surrounding areas. The problem is that when the site was closed years ago, locals were promised that a golf course would be built there. As a result, many residents invested savings to construct apartments and residences in the vicinity -- in some cases just a few yards away from the site. They are now waking up to a mountain of trash instead of 18 holes. A rotten deal indeed.

A Russian strategic bomber flies over an airfield outside Moscow during an air show. Putin said 14 strategic bombers had taken off simultaneously from airfields across Russia in the early hours of Friday on long-range missions. \"We have decided to restore flights by Russian strategic aviation on a permanent basis,\" Putin told reporters after inspecting joint military exercises with China and four Central Asian states in Russia's Ural mountains. \"Today, August 17 at 00:00 hours, 14 strategic bombers took to the air from seven airfields across the country, along with support and refueling aircraft ... From today such patrols will be carried out on a regular basis. \"We hope our partners will treat this with understanding.\" At U.S. President George W. Bush's Texas ranch, White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said he did not believe the flights posed a threat to the United States. \"Militaries around the world engage in a variety of activities, so this is not entirely surprising,\" he said. But the sorties are likely to add to Western concern about Russia's growing assertiveness. That trend has prompted some U.S. policymakers to draw parallels with the Cold War. Putin caused a stir this year by saying Russian missiles would once again be aimed at targets in Europe if Washington persisted with plans to build a missile defense shield in eastern Europe. Russian diplomats have clashed with the United States and European governments on issues such as Kosovo, energy, and Moscow's treatment of its ex-Soviet neighbors. Western military leaders have said this year that Russian flights near their airspace were becoming more frequent after a long quiet period. One Western defense official called the flights \"a little bit of chest-pounding, trying to let people know Russia is back in the game\". Putin said that when Russia had cut its flights in 1992, other military powers had not reciprocated. \"Flights by other countries' strategic aircraft continue and this creates certain problems for ensuring the security of the Russian Federation,\" Putin said. That appeared to be a swipe at the U.S. and NATO, whose strategic bombers have continued to fly long-range missions. As Putin spoke to reporters and television cameras, four Russian military helicopters appeared and hovered in the background while Russian tanks trundled behind him, even though the exercises had ended long before. During the Cold War, Russian long-range bombers, which can carry strategic nuclear weapons, played elaborate games of cat-and-mouse with Western air forces. Earlier this month Russian air force generals said bomber crews had flown near the Pacific island of Guam, where the U.S. military has a base, and \"exchanged smiles\" with U.S. pilots scrambled to track them. The Pentagon said the Russian aircraft had not come close enough to U.S. ships to prompt American aircraft to react. In July, two Russian Tu-95 \"Bear\" bombers made unusually long sorties over the North Sea, leading Norway and Britain to scramble fighter jets to follow them. Russia's air force said later it was a routine flight.  E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

The Hamburger -- Louis' Lunch, New Haven, Connecticut . This burger did not come from Louis' so ketchup is OK. There are competing claims for the coveted \"Inventor of the Hamburger\" title, but according to Louis' Lunch (and the Library of Congress, for that matter), this small New Haven restaurant takes the prize. The story goes something like this: One day in 1900, a rushed businessman asked owner Louis Lassen for something quick that he could eat on the run. Lassen cooked up a beef patty, put it between some bread, and sent the man on his way. Pretty modest beginnings for arguably the most popular sandwich of all-time, huh? If you visit Louis' today, you'll find that not much has changed. The Lassen family still owns and operates the restaurant, the burgers are still cooked in ancient gas stoves, and, just like then, there is absolutely no ketchup allowed. 2. The Fried Twinkie -- The ChipShop, Brooklyn, New York . Sometimes what counts isn't being the inventor, it's being the innovator. Take the fried Twinkie, for example. The Twinkie -- in all its indestructible glory-- has been around for ages, but when ChipShop owner Christopher Sell had the brilliant idea to freeze the snack, dip it in batter, and deep-fry it, the Twinkie took gluttony to new heights. Even The New York Times raved about how \"something magical\" happens when you taste the deep-fried Twinkie's \"luscious vanilla flavor.\" Sell, who was trained in classical French cuisine, didn't start with the Twinkie, though. In his native England, he fried up everything from M&M's to Mars bars. 3. Root Beer Float -- Myers Avenue Red Soda Co., Cripple Creek, Colorado . If you thought what happened up on Cripple Creek only happened in song, you're sorely mistaken. In August of 1893, a failed gold-miner-turned-soda-company-owner named Frank J. Wisner was drinking a bottle of his Myers Avenue Red root beer while looking up at Cow Mountain. Just then, a full moon illuminated the snowcap on the otherwise black mountain, and Wisner had a brilliant idea -- float a scoop of vanilla ice cream in a glass of his root beer. The new drink was christened the \"black cow\" and became an instant classic. Today, of course, most of us call it a root beer float. 4. Corn Dogs -- Cozy Dog Drive In, Springfield, Illinois . In 1946, Ed Waldmire, Jr., revolutionized the stick-meat world when he debuted the Cozy Dog -- the first corn dog on a stick. At first, he wanted to call his creation the \"Crusty Cur,\" but his wife convinced him to change the name to \"Cozy Dog.\" She felt people wouldn't want to eat something described as \"crusty.\" Good call, Mrs. Waldmire. Shortly after the Cozy Dog's inception, the Cozy Dog Drive In opened alongside old Route 66 and has been serving up corn dogs ever since. 5. The Pizzeria -- Lombardi's, New York City, New York . Pizza has existed in one form or another for a long time, but America got her first true pizzeria when Gennaro Lombardi opened up a small grocery store in New York City's Little Italy. An employee named Anthony \"Totonno\" Pero started selling pizzas out of the back, and in no time, Lombardi's was concentrating on its burgeoning pizza business instead of plain old groceries. In 1905, the establishment was licensed as a pizzeria, and it's stayed that way ever since. Well, almost. The original restaurant closed in 1984 but reopened down the street 10 years later. On its 100th anniversary in 2005, Lombardi's decided to offer its pizza for the same price it'd been sold for in 1905 -- 5 cents a pie. Needless to say, the line wrapped around the block. 6. Fat Darrell -- R.U. Hungry, New Brunswick, New Jersey . You may not know what the Fat Darrell is, but when you hear what it contains, you'll understand why it's truly a work of inspired genius. Since 1979, Rutgers University has played host to a collection of mobile food vans collectively known as the \"Grease Trucks.\" Originally, they served a sandwich called the Fat Cat, which contained two cheeseburger patties, French fries, lettuce, tomato, and onions. Then one night in 1997, a hungry (and broke) student named Darrell W. Butler convinced one of the vendors to put chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, French fries, and marinara sauce on a sandwich. Strangely, the concoction sounded so appetizing that the next 10 people in line ordered it, and the Fat Darrell became a mainstay at the Grease Trucks. Hey, not any old sandwich gets to be named Maxim magazine's top \"Meat Hog\" sandwich. 7. Philly Cheesesteak -- Pat's King Of Steaks, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . Philadelphia is known for many things (Ben Franklin, the Liberty Bell, and Rocky, for starters), but fine dining is not really its forte. That's OK, though, because Philly is the home of Pat's King of Steaks, and Pat's King of Steaks is where the Philly cheesesteak was born. One day back in 1932, hot dog stand owners Pasquale (Pat) and Harry Olivieri decided to change things up and make a steak sandwich with onions. A cab driver who ate at Pat's daily insisted on trying the new sandwich, and with the first bite declared, \"Hey, forget 'bout those hot dogs, you should sell these!\" Cab drivers know fast food about as well as anyone, so the brothers did just what the cabbie suggested. In no time, the modest stand turned into the Pat's that exists today. Controversy remains, however, over who's responsible for putting the cheese in cheesesteak. Pat's claims it was the first to do so (in 1951), but across-the-street rival Joe Vento of Geno's Steaks (opened 1966) insists he added the finishing touches. 8. Onion Rings -- Pig Stand, Dallas, Texas . According to most sources, the onion ring was invented when a careless cook at a Pig Stand location in Dallas accidentally dropped an onion slice in some batter, then pulled it out and tossed it in the fryer for lack of a better destination. Now, you'd think inventing the onion ring would be enough for one restaurant chain, but not Pig Stand. The company also lays claim to opening America's first drive-in, inventing Texas toast, and being one of the first restaurants to advertise using neon signs. Not bad for a little outfit from Texas. 9. Derby Pie -- Melrose Inn, Prospect, Kentucky . A Kentucky favorite, derby pie is a chocolate and pecan tart with a pastry-dough crust -- and that's about all we know about it. Why? Because the recipe is jealously guarded by the Kern family. Melrose Inn manager George Kern created derby pie in the mid-1950s with help from his parents, Walter and Leaudra, and the dessert was such a hit that the family was soon baking the treat full-time. In fact, Mrs. Kern, being the crafty monopolist she was, copyrighted the name, and to this day, you can only get real \"Derby-Pie\u00ae\" through Kern's Kitchen, Inc. Not only that, but a man from New England once handed Leaudra a blank check for the recipe so that his daughter could make the pie at home. She refused.I E-mail to a friend .

The Bibi Heybat Mosque, just outside the capital Baku. As a precaution, Britain also shut its embassy in Baku to the public on Monday \"following security concerns nearby,\" Britain's Foreign Office said. The terror plot was unraveled after a weekend raid outside Baku that netted several suspected members of the radical group, two U.S. officials who asked not to be identified and a spokesman for Azerbaijan's National Security Ministry told CNN. U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack stressed that the details \"are still unfolding,\" and the threat \"may or may not be\" linked to the Saturday raid. \"There were some specific and credible threat information concerning the embassy and plans by militants to in some way do harm to individuals in and around the U.S. Embassy there,\" McCormack said, noting that no specific individuals were targeted. Several days ago, an Azerbaijani army officer who had connections to a radical Islamic group seized four assault rifles, a machine gun and 20 hand grenades from his military unit and hid them in the outskirts of Baku, the ministry spokesman and U.S. officials said. Government security forces tracked down the group and arrested several members during a sweep on Saturday in the village of Mastaga, about 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Baku, the spokesman said. One suspected member of the militant group resisted arrest and was killed in the sweep, the spokesman said. Several others are still at large, he added. He said the terror plot also targeted Azerbaijani government buildings. The U.S. Embassy in Baku issued a warden message warning Americans in Azerbaijan to take precautions. \"While there is no information at this time that other American or Western interests in Azerbaijan are being targeted, the U.S. Embassy encourages Americans to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster their own personal security,\" it said. Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic that borders the Caspian Sea, and lies just north of Iran. McCormack said U.S. authorities are working closely with their counterparts in Baku and will determine when normal embassy operations will resume. He said he expects the embassy to limit its operations on Tuesday, as well. E-mail to a friend .

The USS James E. Williams ordered pirates to give up their weapons, the Navy says. When the battle aboard the Dai Hong Dan was over, two pirates were dead and five were captured, the Navy said. Three wounded crew members from the cargo ship were being treated aboard the guided-missile destroyer USS James E. Williams. The captured pirates were being held aboard the North Korean vessel, the Navy said. The bandits had seized the ship's bridge, while the crew kept control of the steering gear and engines, the Navy said. The Koreans moved against the attackers after the Williams -- responding to reports of the hijacking -- ordered the pirates to give up their weapons, according to the Navy. When the crew members stormed the bridge, the deadly battle began. After the crew regained control, Navy sailors boarded the Dai Hong Dan to help with the injured. North Korea and the United States have no diplomatic relations.  Watch why the U.S. helped the North Koreans \u00bb . The incident took place about 70 miles northeast of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, the Navy said. It is the second incident of piracy reported in recent days. A second U.S. Navy destroyer was searching waters off Somalia for pirates who hijacked a Japanese-owned ship, military officials said. Over the weekend, gunmen aboard two skiffs hijacked the Panamanian-flagged Golden Nori off the Socotra archipelago near the Horn of Africa, said Andrew Mwangura, a spokesman for the Kenyan-based Seafarers' Assistance Program. The guided-missile destroyer USS Arleigh Burke has been pursuing the pirates after entering Somali waters with the permission of the troubled transitional government in Mogadishu, U.S. officials said Monday. In recent years, warships have stayed outside the 12-mile limit when chasing pirates. Two military officials familiar with the details confirmed the ongoing operation. The Navy's pursuit of the pirates began Sunday night when the Golden Nori radioed for help. The Burke's sister ship, the USS Porter, opened fire and sank the pirate skiffs tied to the Golden Nori's stern before the Burke took over shadowing the hijacked vessel. When the shots were fired, it was not known the ship was filled with highly flammable benzene. U.S. military officials indicate there is a great deal of concern about the cargo because it is so sensitive. Benzene, which U.S. authorities have declared a known human carcinogen, is used as a solvent and to make plastics and synthetic fabrics. Four other ships in the region remain in pirate hands, the Navy said. U.S. and NATO warships have been patrolling off the Horn of Africa for years in an effort to crack down on piracy off Somalia, where a U.N.-backed transitional government is struggling to restore order after 15 years of near-anarchy.  See how piracy is worse than 2006 \u00bb . On Monday, the head of the transitional government resigned as his administration -- backed by Ethiopian troops -- battled insurgents from the Islamic movement that seized control of Mogadishu in 2006. Hospital officials reported 30 dead in three days of clashes on the city's south side. In June, the ship USS Carter Hall fired warning shots in an attempt to stop a hijacked Danish cargo ship off Somalia, but the American vessel turned away when the pirated ship entered Somali waters. In May, a U.S. Navy advisory warned merchant ships to stay at least 200 miles off the Somali coast. But the U.S. Maritime Administration said pirates sometimes issue false distress calls to lure ships closer to shore.  See the warning area \u00bb . The pirates often are armed with automatic rifles and shoulder-fired rockets, according to a recent warning from the agency. \"To date, vessels that increase speed and take evasive maneuvers avoid boarding, while those that slow down are boarded, taken to the Somali coastline and released after successful ransom payment, often after protracted negotiations of as much as 11 weeks,\" the warning advised. The agency issued a new warning to sailors in the Gulf of Aden, between Somalia and Yemen, after Sunday's hijacking. E-mail to a friend .

Debra Lafave was arrested after talking with a teenager. She is not allowed to have contact with anyone under 18. But the judge did not send Lafave to jail, saying the violation was \"not willful and substantial.\" \"Please don't come back,\" he scolded. Dressed in a tailored, black pantsuit, Lafave said she had \"innocent\" physical contact with a female co-worker she knew as under age 18.  Watch Lafave in the courtroom \u00bb . At the time, she and the 17-year-old hostess worked at Danny Boy's, a small restaurant in the Tampa, Florida, area. Lafave, 27, pleaded guilty in November 2005 to having sex with a 14-year-old boy and was sentenced to three years under house arrest and seven years of probation. Lafave was required to register as a sex offender and ordered not to have any contact with minors. A tracking device she carries as part of her probation went off in court, prompting the prosecutor to observe, \"I think she's accounted for.\" Lafave acknowledged she was aware that hugs and other forms of physical contact -- as well as conversations about sex -- with minors violated terms of her probation. She referred to the sexually explicit conversations at work as just \"girl talk.\" Lafave denied talking about her sex life with co-workers. \"I don't speak that way about my personal life,\" she said. But she added that her co-workers spoke freely about sex in a \"small group setting.\" While other co-workers socialized outside work, Lafave said, the 17-year-old was not included in those outings. Asked why she hugged the young co-worker, Lafave explained it was a small restaurant with a casual atmosphere where co-workers felt like family. The contact came, she said, \"out of my good nature, that's the way it worked.\" The contacts that led to Thursday's probation violation hearing first surfaced during two polygraph tests administered as part of Lafave's court-ordered supervision. She received a verbal reprimand a year ago, according to testimony. When the behavior continued, her probation officer asked a judge to find her in violation. She was ordered to quit the restaurant job and now works as a receptionist in her mother's beauty shop. In the past, Lafave has said she suffers from bipolar disorder and is receiving treatment.

It doesn't really matter all that much what hot, nubile French maverick has set the fashion world on fire. Or which Milanese visionary has a new fabric technique discovered during a life-changing trip to Angkor Wat that's sure to bring back sixties minimalism with a twist. Or that so-and-so has signed a deal to develop boutique spa hotels around the globe in former monasteries. Because, in the end, he's Ralph Lauren, and we're not. Ralph Lauren has his eye on China and Japan. For four decades no other designer has had a greater impact, not only on the way American men and women dress but also on the way they imagine, seek and indulge in the Good Life, than the former tie salesman from the Bronx. \"Those ties were handmade, by the way,\" recalls Lauren. \"Back then, ties, even designer ones, didn't sell for more than $5 apiece. Mine were $12 to $15. Such luxury in something so simple was revolutionary.\" And ironic. Because while no other designer logo exemplifies aspiration in the home of the free and the brave like the mallet-wielding guy on the pony, Lauren originally named his company Polo because \"it was the sport of kings. It was glamorous, sexy and international.\"  See his designs \u00bb . In the beginning a few people questioned if it was named after Marco Polo -- but today the fact that virtually none of Lauren's millions of devoted customers has ever even seen a polo match is immaterial. Lauren instinctively caught something that was in the air before any of his competitors had a chance to grab it -- the desire, not just to be a success but to look like one before you'd even achieved your goal. What's more, Lauren made it look as easy as Fred Astaire dancing down a staircase. \"What matters the most to me are clothes that are consistent and accessible,\" says the designer. \"When I look at the people I've admired over the years, the ultimate stars, like Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant and Astaire, the ones who last the longest are the ones whose style has a consistency, whose naturalness is part of their excitement. And when you think of the blur of all the brands that are out there, the ones you believe in and the ones you remember, like Chanel and Armani, are the ones that stand for something. Fashion is about establishing an image that consumers can adapt to their own individuality. And it's an image that can change, that can evolve. It doesn't reinvent itself every two years.\" However, with a media that is insatiable for the new, the now and the next, being steadfast doesn't always make for good copy. \"The spotlight is always going to search for the newcomer,\" Lauren admits. \"And that's fine. But the key to longevity is to keep doing what you do better than anyone else. We work real hard at that. It's about getting your message out to the consumer. It's about getting their trust, but also getting them excited, again and again. My clothes -- the clothes we make for the runway -- aren't concepts. They go into stores. Our stores. Thankfully, we have lots of them,\" says Lauren. \"What I rely on is people walking into my store saying, 'I want your clothes.'\" Well, if all of Lauren's customers shouted that together, he would go deaf faster than he could pull on one of his classic pullovers. Lauren's effortless luxury is all over the red carpet, on ski slopes and boats, at Wimbledon and elsewhere. It furnishes living rooms and graces dinner tables. It's on the bed, in the bed and under the bed -- and now sits on coffee tables, thanks to the tome Ralph Lauren (Rizzoli), celebrating his 40-years-and-growing career. But far from giving his customary over-the-head wave and riding off into his Colorado-ranch sunset, the designer is going even more global. \"Americans have a real inferiority about their own style. We've brought sportswear to the world, and yet we have a long way to go.\" Already in Milan, London, Paris and Moscow, Lauren has more stores planned for China, Japan ... oh, everywhere. \"There aren't enough Americans out there,\" he says. Who better to start with than Ralph? Just as long as he doesn't let on that most of us still can't play a lick of polo. E-mail to a friend . Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE!

Miami Police Chief John Timoney said he had been alerted by Philadelphia police that the suspect, John Lewis, had taken a Miami-bound bus from Philadelphia. Acting on information from Miami Rescue Mission, officers went to a homeless shelter where they found Lewis, \"who was pretty easy to spot as he's 6 feet, 270 pounds,\" Timoney said. He was apprehended \"unarmed and without incident,\" the Miami chief said. Timoney said it didn't appear that anyone in Miami was helping Lewis, according to CNN affiliate WPVI. Miami Police Officer Gil Gonzalez said Lewis \"had a Bible and was praying when we went to get him. He had a look of guilt, a look of shock.\" Philadelphia Mayor John F. Street said people at the shelter recognized Lewis from televised photos of the suspect. Lewis is suspected in the October 31 shooting of Philadelphia Police Officer Chuck Cassidy. Cassidy was shot in the head when he inadvertently walked into a robbery in progress at a Dunkin' Donuts. He died the next day. Investigators told WPVI that Lewis was spotted on security video boarding a bus to Miami on Saturday night. Cassidy was one of three Philadelphia police officers shot in a four-day period last week. Mariano Santiago was shot in the shoulder late last Tuesday as he approached a vehicle. He is in fair condition. Officer Sandra VanHinkle was shot early last Sunday and is out of the hospital and doing well, police say. Former co-workers of Lewis who spoke to WPVI said they were surprised by the allegations against him. \"He was so nice,\" Kiani Clark told the station. \"He was really nice. He didn't seem like the type that would hurt a fly.\" The Associated Press reported that Lewis had been arrested in 2005 on drug charges, which were withdrawn after he completed a treatment program.  He was arrested again in June on drug charges, and that case is still pending, the AP reported. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Aurore Ankarcrona contributed to this report. Copyright 2007 CNN.

A \"shark\" that races down roads. To break from the boring econobox, here are some of the more sculpted and stylish cars available for about $20,000 that will hold their looks for a long time and give a little bit of joy to a first-time owner. Hyundai Tiburon . If you didn't know already, Tiburon means \"shark\" in Spanish, and it's not hard to see how Hyundai's sporty coupe can stalk the unwary first-time buyer and snare them quickly. Like an instantly recognizable dorsal fin, the Tiburon in its third incarnation is perhaps the purest low-slung sportster that won't bust a first-time buyer's wallet, though it may chew a hole in the seat of their pants as they're pushed back into those tight-hugging bucket seats. The startling Hyundai-designed looks boast a touch of Italian styling uncommon for its bracket. Mazda MazdaSpeed3 . A bona-fide pocket rocket, any first-time buyer can put a fair distance between themselves and the pack in the MazdaSpeed3, part of the Asian carmaker's strategy to wrestle performance compact coupe sales from European carmakers. This one isn't overbearingly dripped in trim or wings, but don't let any youngster tell you it doesn't have what it takes to make their peers jealous. The MazdaSpeed3 will storm from standing to a mile a minute in under six seconds and is said to hit 155 mph. Its secret is torque negation in the low gears -- and perhaps its 263 horses under the hood. Another hidden gem is its seven-speaker Bose stereo. Pontiac G5 GT Coupe . Much like the fantastic Chevy Cobalt SS, its younger sister Pontiac G5 GT boasts highly sprung motoring at a price that appeals to the first-time buyer's wallet. The G5 GT has been tweaked just slightly from its sister SS -- like the difference between Ashlee and Jessica Simpson -- boasting a less horizontal grille and more sculpted valance. Both are reasonably stylish from the back and side and both leaving plenty room for aftermarket add-ons. A new grille entirely, like a Phantom, may just be what you need to set it off against the crowd. The GT's inline-four 2.4-liter 173-hp engine -- 25hp over the base -- drives the front wheels to hit 0-60 mph in 7.5 seconds. Gas mileage is good and customer satisfaction ratings are off the hook. Ford Mustang V6 . A revamped chassis is the key to why Ford's Mustang has become an outstanding product at a price that's hard to beat. A tweak to the iconic lines for last year included a smaller back window and a longer, craggier front end. Some might of course call us heretics for picking a V6 over the famous eight-cylinder included in the GT package but, to be honest, the V6 performs admirably, pushes out 210hp and emits a low-down growl that sounds wonderful. And it's still a Mustang. Civic Coupe . A Civic hatch was my second car (after a very short-lived VW Rabbit). The coupe tested earlier this year brought back fond memories of the Civic's surprisingly roomy front cabin, its enjoyable handling and maneuverability, first-class economy and its sporty elongated hood and swooping back end. Standard features include a 350-watt premium sound system, a touch-screen satellite-navigation system whose screen flips to reveal the CD player, and a slot for a computer memory card. It's also got a funky dash that spectrally lights at night -- what fun. Scion xB . On the heels of its 2004 release, Toyota's hipster Scion brand has remodeled its boxy wonder this year, this time boasting more than a design nod to its parent company's FJ Cruiser. Wide rear pillars, wraparound headlights and bumper define the second-generation variant, which comes dripping with gadgetry inside, as well as leaving plenty of room for after-market customization. This one turns heads while allowing you to pack five adults in relative comfort. Other notable features include a central console that fits in a DVD player alongside a backlit GPS sat-nav system that lights up in any one of 10 colors. Honda Fit . A co-worker bought one of these after crashing her old and very badly beaten up Saturn on a left turn into oncoming traffic. Ouch. So it technically wasn't her first car, but for many buyers, it will be. Energetic, filled with flair and boasting a vertical fold the length of its bonnet, the Fit looks the part as well as being colossally roomy inside for what you expect. You don't get a third row of seats in there but, with the back row folded flat, it almost lends you to believe it can become a camper. Other great touches include an mp3 input jack and reclining rear-seat headrests, while gas mileage is, as expected, very good indeed.

Democrats quickly fired back. Jim Manley, senior aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, said, \"Taking advice from President Bush about fiscal responsibility and getting things done for the American people is like taking hunting lessons from Dick Cheney. Neither is a very good idea.\" Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Illinois, issued a statement saying, \"President Bush's rally this morning reminds us that congressional Republicans remain ready and willing to rubber-stamp the Bush agenda: No to children's health care; no to a new direction in Iraq; and no to investing in America's future. The White House and congressional Republicans want to continue the status quo.\" Bush said the Senate was \"wasting valuable time\" by taking up the children's health insurance bill, which he had earlier vetoed.  Watch Bush describe what he thinks Congress is doing wrong \u00bb . House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, issued a statement calling Bush \"the biggest obstacle\" to extending health coverage to \"10 million low-income, working-class American children.\" Hoyer said GOP House leaders need to \"stop posing for pictures, and sit down with Democrats and Republicans in Congress who are working together to extend coverage to our children.\" The State Children's Health Insurance Program measure passed in the House last week would expand the program by nearly $35 billion over five years, the same as the measure Bush vetoed on October 3. Bush had proposed adding $5 billion to the program, and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded, state-run program. Democratic leaders said the new version addresses Republican objections by tightening restrictions on illegal immigrants receiving SCHIP benefits; capping the income levels of families that qualify for the program; and preventing adults from receiving benefits. The program currently covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor, but who can't afford private insurance. Democrats want to extend the program to another 4 million, paying for it with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes. Bush said Congress knows the current version of the children's health bill \"does not have a chance,\" to get enough votes to override another veto. Hoyer accused Bush of breaking a promise he made in 2004 to extend coverage under the SCHIP program. \"Now, Congress must do what the president said he would do,\" he said in his statement. The Senate could vote on the bill as early as Tuesday. Bush also threatened to veto a \"three-bill pileup.\" \"There are now reports that Congressional leaders may be considering combining the Veterans and Department of Defense appropriations bills, and then add a bloated labor, health and education spending bill to both of them,\" he said. \"Congress should pass each bill one at a time in a fiscally responsible manner,\" he said. Bush also urged Congress to send him a \"clean defense appropriations bill and a war supplemental bill.\" \"They ought to get me a bill that funds among other things bullets and body armor,\" he said. Bush also criticized Congress for trying to \"hold hostage\" funding for troops. \"It would be irresponsible to not give our troops the resources they need to get their job done because Congress was unable to get its job done,\" he said. Hoyer's release said Bush's comments on appropriations bills and fiscal responsibility \"ring hollow.\" \"The fact is, this administration has pursued the most fiscally irresponsible policies in American history, turning record surpluses into record deficits and adding more than $3 trillion to the national debt,\" he said. \"Democrats are the party of fiscal responsibility today because we believe our government must pay for the things it purchases and not force our children to pay our bills.

Malvo, 22, spends 23 hours a day inside his cell at Virginia's toughest prison, a maximum-security compound called Red Onion, not far from the Kentucky border. He's serving a life sentence. According to social worker Carmeta Albarus-Lindo, Malvo is a changed person since he and John Allen Muhammad terrorized the Washington area five years ago this month in attacks that left 10 dead over a 23-day period. \"The most I can do is to continue to be there, because that is his greatest fear -- that, you know, another parental figure would abandon him because that was what he'd been exposed to all his life,\" said Albarus-Lindo, who has spent hundreds of hours with Malvo since his arrest and conviction.  Read the letter \u00bb . She said one of those \"parental\" figures was Muhammad, who met Malvo in the Caribbean nearly two years before the deadly shooting spree began in 2002. Muhammad became the teenager's surrogate father, convincing him that violence was the only way to correct perceived injustices to African-Americans, Albarus-Lindo said. He ordered Malvo to go to bed each night and to memorize passages from \"The Art of War,\" an ancient Chinese text on battlefield strategy. According to Albarus-Lindo, Malvo was \"brainwashed\" into aiding Muhammad in the murders. However, prosecutors have said Malvo, even at 17, knew what he was doing. \"I thought he was coldblooded,\" said Paul Ebert, commonwealth attorney for Prince William County, Virginia, of the first time he met Malvo. \"He was a person who had chosen a life of crime.\" And when a Virginia jury spared Malvo's life, some investigators said they were horrified. \"That was the hardest day of my career,\" said April Carroll of the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco. \"I felt that day we had failed when Malvo was not sentenced to death.\" Some of the victims' families said they are content that Malvo did not receive the death penalty. Vicki Buchanan Snyder, whose brother James \"Sonny\" Buchanan was shot in the back while mowing a patch of lawn at a Maryland auto dealership, said she was \"satisfied\" with the jury's verdict. As for Malvo, Albarus-Lindo said he will \"never forgive himself for what has happened.\" When she first began seeing him, he still called Muhammad \"Dad.\" It took months, she said, before he stopped. In the interim, Albarus-Lindo said, he took college correspondence courses and began to draw. Muhammad is at a Virginia prison called Sussex One. In a DVD made last year inside prison and obtained exclusively by CNN, he said he is \"still fighting\" on death row.

Erik Prince, CEO and chairman of Blackwater USA, is sworn in Tuesday at a congressional hearing. The committee convened amid an FBI investigation into a September 16 shootout involving Blackwater personnel that resulted in the deaths of Iraqi civilians. Following is a transcript of Prince's opening statement: . Chairman [Henry] Waxman, [D-California], Congressman [Thomas] Davis, [R-Virginia], members of the committee, my name is Eric Prince, and I am the chairman and CEO of the Prince Group and Blackwater USA. Blackwater's a team of dedicated professionals who provide training to America's military and law enforcement communities and risk their lives to protect Americans in harm's way overseas. Under the direction and oversight of the United States government, Blackwater provides an opportunity for military and law enforcement veterans with a record of honorable service to continue their support to the United States. Words alone cannot express the respect I have for these brave men and women who defend -- who volunteer to defend U.S. personnel facilities and diplomatic missions. I am proud to be there to represent them today. After almost five years in active service as a U.S. Navy SEAL, I founded Blackwater in 1997. I wanted to offer the military and law enforcement communities assistance by providing expert instruction and world-class training venues. Ten years later, Blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the United States military and law enforcement agencies every day. After 9/11, when the U.S. began its stabilization efforts in Afghanistan and then Iraq, the United States government called upon Blackwater to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas. Blackwater responded immediately. We are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country. Blackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans, many of whom have recent military deployments. No individual ever protected by Blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured. There is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men. At the same time, 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for Blackwater and its affiliates. Numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed. The entire Blackwater family mourns the loss of these brave lives. Our thoughts and our prayers are with their families. The areas of Iraq in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging. Blackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within Iraq. We're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 American military personnel and thousands of innocent Iraqis. Any incident where Americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep American officials and dignitaries safe, including visiting members of Congress. In doing so, more American service members are available to fight the enemy. Blackwater shares the committee's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting U.S. operations. The company's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes, treaties and regulations of the United States. Blackwater looks forward to working with Congress and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented. The worldwide personnel protection services contract, which has been provided to this committee, was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance, including the hiring, vetting guidelines, background checks, screening, training standards, rules of force and conduct standards. In Iraq, Blackwater reports to the embassy's regional security officer, or RSO. All Blackwater movements and operations are directed by the RSO. In conjunction with internal company procedures and controls, the RSO ensures that Blackwater complies with all relevant contractual terms and conditions, as well as any applicable laws and regulations. We have approximately 1,000 professionals serving today in Iraq as part of our nation's total force. Blackwater does not engage in offensive or military missions but performs only defensive security functions. My understanding of the September 16 incident is that the Department of State and the FBI are conducting a full investigation, but those results are not yet available. We at Blackwater welcome the FBI review announced yesterday, and we will cooperate fully and look forward to receiving their conclusions. I just want to put some other things in perspective. A recent report from the Department of State stated that in 2007 Blackwater conducted 1,873 security details for diplomatic visits to the red zone, areas outside the Green Zone in Iraq, and there have been only 56 incidences in which weapons were discharged, or less than 3 percent of all movements. In 2006, Blackwater conducted over 6,500 diplomatic movements in the Red Zone. Weapons were discharged in less than 1 percent of those missions. To the extent there is any loss of innocent life, ever, let me be clear that I consider that tragic. Every life, whether American or Iraqi, is precious. I stress to the committee and to the American public, however, that I believe we acted appropriately at all times. I am prepared to answer your questions.

Augustin Binya, right, lunges towards Celtic midfielder Scott Brown during Benfica's 1-0 defeat in Glasgow. The Cameroon international was sent off for the challenge in his side's 1-0 defeat in the Champions League match in Glasgow last Wednesday. Scotland international Brown avoided injury, but claimed Binya had tried to break his leg with the tackle in the 85th minute -- and demanded that Europe's governing body take further action. Binya, 24, apologized for the challenge -- described by officiating referee Martin Hansson of Sweden as one of the worst he had ever seen -- on the day after the match. But UEFA's control and disciplinary body announced their sanction on Friday morning, having deliberated on the case on Thursday. In a statement on uefa.com, Binya's challenge was described as one which \"seriously endangered the physical health of the opposing player\". Benfica can appeal against the ban, which rules Binya out of the Portuguese club's remaining Group D matches against AC Milan and Shakhtar Donetsk. If unsuccessful, he will also miss any matches in the knockout stages of the Champions League or UEFA Cup. The suspension will also carry over to future seasons if, as seems likely, Benfica finish bottom of Group D and bow out of Europe for this campaign. Brown, who has been passed fit for Scotland's Euro 2008 qualifier against Italy, said straight after the Benfica match: \"He obviously tried to do me as hard as possible.\" It is the second time that UEFA has had to intervene following an incident involving Celtic this season. AC Milan keeper Dida was handed a two-match ban, subsequently reduced to one on appeal, after collapsing theatrically when a fan of the Scottish club invaded the pitch and lightly slapped the Brazilian in the face.

Hillary Clinton remains the person to beat, a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll released Monday suggests. As the countdown begins to November 4, 2008, the New York Democrat continues to dominate the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, and comes out ahead when voters are asked whether they prefer her or the GOP front-runner, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. But Clinton's path to the White House is in no way certain. Clinton was criticized for her performance during a debate last week, and her rivals for the Democratic nomination have stepped up attacks that she has equivocated on her position on Iraq, Iran and other major issues. The Republican presidential candidates have also stepped up their attacks on the Democratic front-runner, with each suggesting that he has the best chance of stopping Clinton. The attacks may be working. The CNN/Opinion Research polls suggests that Clinton's support has slipped from its height one month ago.  Watch CNN's Bill Schneider on the latest poll numbers \u00bb . \"Clinton's strength is about where it was throughout the summer, indicating that she has lost the support she gained last month but that Obama has not yet cut into her core constituency,\" CNN political director Keating Holland said. Clinton is the top choice of 44 percent of the likely Democratic voters interviewed for the poll. Her closest rival, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, was the top choice of 25 percent, and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina has 14 percent. All other Democratic candidates were in single digits. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson was backed by 4 percent, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware by 3 percent, Sen. Christopher Dodd by 2 percent, Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich by 2 percent and former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel was at 1 percent. The poll involved 467 interviews conducted on November 2-4 with Democrats or independents who lean Democratic. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.  View the poll results \u00bb . In an October CNN/Opinion Research poll, Clinton was supported by 51 percent of Democratic voters and had a 30 point lead over Obama. During last week's Democratic debate, Clinton received heavy criticism from her fellow Democratic presidential rivals, who are desperate to shake up the presidential race just months before the first voting occurs in the Iowa Caucus in early January. Edwards was particularly aggressive during the debate, criticizing Clinton for her stance on Iraq, Iran and Social Security. \"The American people ... deserve a president of the United States that they know will tell them the truth and won't say one thing one time and something different at a different time,\" Edwards said. Edwards has also accused Clinton of being a \"corporate Democrat\" too willing to defend a \"corrupt\" Washington establishement. \"We desperately need in the next president someone that recognizes we have a system in Washington that's become broken, corruption has crept into it, and we have to tell the truth about that,\" Edwards said Monday. \"If you defend that system, I don't believe you can bring about the change that America needs.\" In the Republican presidential race, Giuliani continues to be the leading candidate, with the backing of 28 percent of the Republican primary voters polled. Former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee was backed by 19 percent. Sen. John McCain of Arizona was the top pick of 16 percent, and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney had 11 percent. Of the remaining Republican candidates, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee received 10 percent, Texas Rep. Ron Paul 5 percent, California Rep. Duncan Hunter 4 percent and Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo 3 percent. The poll involved telephone interviews with 397 Republicans or independents who lean Republican. The poll's margin of error was 5 percentage points. In a head-to-head matchup of the two front-runners, Clinton leads Giuliani 51 percent to 45 percent. That lead has increased since October, when Clinton led Giuliani 49 percent to 47 percent. \"The overall political environment seems to favor the Democrats, partly because Democratic voters are more enthusiastic about the coming election and partly because the public is in a sour mood, which is usually not a good sign for the incumbent party,\" Holland said. Only 42 percent of Americans think things are going well, while 58 percent think things are going badly, the poll found. \"The public is not just pessimistic about the country -- Americans are angry,\" Holland said.  \"More than eight in 10 say they are angry about the way things are going in the country.\" Clinton's lead over Giuliani would be greater if a third-party candidate entered the race who believes abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, the poll found. In a three-way race, Clinton would get the support of 48 percent of voters, Giuliani 32 percent and the third-party candidate 18 percent. The poll's margin of error was plus-or-minus 3 percent. \"My analysis of it is that [a third-party candidate] is more of an attempt to keep the nomination from me,\" Giuliani said. \"You know it is a tactic, and a legitimate one. People have to think about that and consider it.'' The lack of enthusiasm for Giuliani, particularly by social conservatives, could spell trouble for the GOP next year if he becomes the nominee, Holland said. \"Only 27 percent of Republicans say they would feel enthusiastic if Giuliani won the GOP nod, and the remaining GOP candidates fare even worse,\" he said.

Russia is building Iran's first nuclear power plant and has resisted moves by the U.S. and its allies to impose stronger U.N. sanctions against Tehran. On Monday, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates reiterated the Bush administration's stance that \"all options\" must be kept \"on the table\" in confronting the threats posed by Iran -- a reference to the option of using military action against the long-time U.S. adversary. \"We should have no illusions about the nature of this regime or its leaders -- about their designs for their nuclear program, their willingness to live up to their rhetoric, their intentions for Iraq, or their ambitions in the Gulf region,\" Gates said in a speech to the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs. The leaders of Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan also met Tuesday to reach agreement on issues relating to the sharing and regulating of the Caspian Sea -- the world's largest inland body of water. Speaking afterwards, Putin said that no Caspian nation should offer its territory to third parties intent on military action against other countries in the region -- a reference to rumors that the U.S. planned to use Azerbaijan as a base for a possible attack against Iran, The Associated Press reported. \"We are saying that no Caspian nation should offer its territory to third powers for use of force or military aggression against any Caspian state,\" Putin said. \"The Caspian Sea is an inland sea and it only belongs to the Caspian states, therefore only they are entitled to have their ships and military forces here,\" added Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Putin, defying reports of an assassination plot against him, was greeted by Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki as he stepped off his plane at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport. During a news conference Monday after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Wiesbaden, Germany, Putin said rumors of an attempt on his life would not stop his plans. \"Of course I will travel to Iran,\" Putin said. \"If I reacted to these kinds of rumors every time, I could never leave the house.\" Iranian officials denied there was an assassination plot against Putin, with a Foreign Ministry spokesman describing rumors of a possible terrorist action during the Putin visit baseless. \"Spreading this kind of totally false news lacks any value and cannot damage the trend of the prepared programs,\" spokesman Mohammadali Hosseini told the Iranian FARS news agency. Hosseini blamed the rumor on Western media, particularly the U.S. media, saying the report was \"made up by the enemies of relations between Iran and Russia to create a psychological war.\" Putin's visit is the first by a leader in the Kremlin to Iran since Joseph Stalin's World War II conference meeting with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. \"Putin's trip to Tehran is a show of Russia's independence in global affairs.

But 14 other people remained in custody in the African nation, some facing serious charges that could send them to jail for up to 20 years. The journalists were among seven Europeans a Chadian judge released Sunday, including a Spanish flight crew, whom Sarkozy dropped off in a brief stop in Madrid on his way back from Chad. All were arrested last week after workers from Zoe's Ark -- a French-based charity group -- were accused of trying to fly 103 children out of Chad in a kidnapping and adoption operation.  Watch a report on how the events unfolded \u00bb . Some of the children may never return to their families because it is too difficult to determine their backgrounds, Red Cross spokeswoman Inah Kaloga told CNN on Friday. Those who remain under arrest in Chad are six members of the French charity, four Chadians and four remaining members of the flight crew. Some face kidnapping and fraud charges. Zoe's Ark leader Eric Breteau testified Saturday to a court in the Chadian capital that the three journalists and the flight crew of seven Spaniards and a Belgian were not involved in the alleged plot, court witnesses told CNN. At least some of the flight crew are scheduled to testify before a judge on Monday. The three journalists initially had been charged with complicity in the alleged kidnapping attempt. It's not clear if the charges against them have been dropped.  Watch the freed Europeans leave Chad \u00bb . In a joint news conference with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero on Sunday at Madrid's Torrejon Air Force Base, Sarkozy expressed satisfaction that some of those detained had been released. At the same time, however, he told reporters, \"We should respect the sovereignty of Chad.\" Zapatero thanked Sarkozy for dropping the four Spanish flight crew members off in their home country, and thanked Chadian President Idriss Deby for allowing them to return. After his emergency talks in Chad, Sarkozy stressed the scandal would not affect the strong relations between the two countries or affect the planned deployment of a European force to protect refugees from Sudan's Darfur region who have fled to Chad and the neighboring Central African Republic. Sarkozy also said he hoped the six remaining French nationals -- all from Zoe's Ark -- would face trial in France. The charity says that the children were orphans from the Darfur region -- where the United Nations estimates 200,000 people have been killed in four years of conflict -- and that the group was taking them to host families in France. But after preliminary interviews with the children, aid agencies said Thursday it appeared most of them probably are not orphans and not from Sudan, but instead come from villages on the Chadian side of the border with Sudan. The children are staying in an Abeche orphanage while aid agencies and government officials try to find out where they came from -- a challenge hindered by the number of children, their youth, and the volatile situation in the region. A father of three of the children allegedly kidnapped told a French newspaper he put his children into the charity's care after he was told they would be educated at a school under construction in a nearby town. The Chadian man, who gave his name as Arbab, told Le Parisien on Sunday that workers from Zoe's Ark had visited his village three times. \"They never said they would take away our children,\" he told the newspaper.

Memphis Police Department Director Larry Godwin said DeeShawn Tate, 21, Victor Trezevant, 21, and Courtney Washington, 22, had been charged with murder in perpetration of attempted aggravated robbery. Homicide investigators developed the case against the three men with the help of a citizen's tip and Crimestoppers, he said. Godwin said the investigation continues, and \"we do expect additional arrests in this case.\" \"It was an attempted robbery, aggravated robbery,\" he said. Bradford \"was targeted because of some information that was out there and the fact that they believed he had some cash, or he had something that they wanted.\" Godwin said none of the three arrested suspects were students at the university, but he would not rule out that other suspects could be students. Shelby County District Attorney General William L. Gibbons said the three suspects would make an initial court appearance as early as Tuesday. He said prosecutors were considering seeking the death penalty in the case, but no decision had been made. \"Whether or not it will be would be premature for me to say,\" Gibbons said. \"There are a lot of factors that go into it. We'll make a determination at the appropriate time.\" Officials at the 21,000-student school said Bradford, a marketing major who lived on campus, was popular with the football team and on the campus as a whole. He had transferred from Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama, and was 36 credit hours short of graduation.

Kevin Federline and Britney Spears, here during happier times, have two children. Spears' former husband, Kevin Federline, is to retain custody of their two sons \"until further order of the court,\" according to a ruling by Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon. It was not clear what led to Monday's decision awarding Federline full custody. A transcript of the court proceedings was ordered sealed. Last month, a judge ordered Spears, 25, to submit to random drug tests after finding she engaged in \"habitual, frequent, and continuous use of controlled substances and alcohol.\" That order, also by Gordon, provided no details and did not name any drugs. The former couple has been embroiled in a bitter custody fight over their sons, Sean Preston and Jayden. The parents had split custody 50-50, but Federline then asked for the arrangements to be shifted to 70-30 in his favor.  Watch how Spears became user of -- and prisoner to -- fame \u00bb . In addition to ordering the twice-weekly drug tests, Gordon ordered Spears to spend eight hours per week working with a \"parenting coach,\" who was to observe her interactions with her children. Gordon also told both parents to avoid alcohol or \"other non-prescription controlled substances\" 12 hours before taking custody of the children. He also barred the exes from making \"derogatory remarks about the other party and the other party's family or significant other\" during the case. And he ordered the parents to go through \"joint co-parenting counseling\" and barred them from using corporal punishment on the boys. Spears and Federline were married for two years before their divorce became final in July. Monday's order comes amid a career freefall for Spears, whose new album is due to be released November 13. After her September 9 \"comeback\" performance on the MTV Video Music Awards, critics derided her singing and dancing as lackluster and said she appeared overweight in her sequined two-piece costume. Her former divorce lawyer, Laura Wasser, resigned last month as her legal representative after telling reporters the singer \"just wants to be a mom.\" Spears' management company, the Firm, recently quit after representing the singer for little over a month.

Simpson leaves the Clark County Detention Center late Wednesday night. Eighth District Judge Jackie Glass hours earlier doubled Simpson's bail to ensure his appearance at an April 7 trial. Glass said Simpson had violated terms of his previous bail. Glass was adamant that Simpson remain in the Clark County Detention Center until 15 percent of the $250,000 is paid in full -- $37,500 -- after it was revealed in court that Simpson never paid any part of his previous $125,000 bail. \"There's no 'get-out-of-jail-free card' today,\" an angry Glass told Simpson's lawyers. \"I don't want him out of the jail until the 15 percent is paid in full.\"  Watch the scolding judge \u00bb . The judge scolded Simpson, saying he wasn't taking the matter seriously. \"I don't know if it's just arrogance. I don't know if it's ignorance,\" she chided. Simpson posted bail at about 6:15 p.m. local time (9:15 p.m. ET), according to Las Vegas authorities. Simpson returned to jail in Nevada from his home in Florida January 11 for Wednesday's hearing, after prosecutors alleged he violated the terms of his bail by attempting to contact a co-defendant. The original bail bondsman -- Miguel Pereira of Florida-based You Ring, We Spring -- testified Wednesday that the former football player didn't put any money toward the bail that allowed him to leave jail in September. \"Not one cent,\" he said. The bail bondsman himself paid the 15 percent premium and the $40 filing fee to allow Simpson to leave the detention center, although he said he had a power of attorney for Simpson's Florida home but never filed a lien on it. When questioned by Simpson attorney Yale Galanter, Pereira admitted he had never sent Simpson a bill for the premium. But, he said, he had an understanding with Simpson that he would be paid \"after it was all over.\" Glass described it as \"mind-boggling\" that Simpson never had to put up any collateral for his first bond and that the bail bondsman never asked for anything. Prosecutors also produced Wednesday a recording of a profanity-laced voice mail message left on Pereira's answering machine in November from Simpson, which he told Pereira to deliver to co-defendant Clarence Stewart. The prosecutor said the message contained \"an undercurrent of a threat,\" and he wanted the bail to be raised to at least $1 million. Galanter did not contest the authenticity of the recording. As part of his bail granted September 19, Simpson was to have no contact whatsoever with victims, witnesses or co-defendants in the case. Glass said the same goes this time.  Watch how Simpson wound up in jail \u00bb . \"When I tell you, Mr. Simpson, there are conditions and there are rules, let me make sure you understand if you violate those rules ... you'll be back, locked up in the Clark County Detention Center; do you understand me?\" the judge asked. \"I understand 100 percent,\" said Simpson, dressed in a navy blue jail jumpsuit. \"No contact [with others in case], no phone messages to third parties, no emails, no letters -- nothing,\" Glass added. Galanter said his client \"was truly contrite about what has occurred.\" \"He will abide scrupulously by whatever this court decides,\" the attorney said. Simpson faces trial April 7 on 12 criminal counts, including conspiracy, kidnapping, robbery, burglary, coercion and assault with a deadly weapon. The charges stem from a September 13 incident at a Las Vegas hotel in which he allegedly stole sports memorabilia he said belonged to him from dealers Alfred Beardsley and Bruce Fromong. According to earlier testimony, Beardsley and Fromong were offering more than 600 Simpson-related items for sale, including ties Simpson wore during his criminal trial for the 1994 murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. Simpson was acquitted in that trial.

The Air Force grounded models of its F-15 fleet after the crash of an older model F-15C this month. The F-15s were grounded after a crash earlier this month in Missouri of an older model that disintegrated in flight. Each F-15E must pass an inspection of critical parts on the airframe before returning to flying missions, Air Force officials said. All U.S. Air Force 224 E-model aircraft will undergo a one-time inspection of hydraulic system lines, the Air Force statement said. The longerons -- molded, metal strips of the aircraft fuselage that run from front to rear -- will also be inspected, according to the Air Force. The straps and skin panels in and around the environmental control system bay will also be examined, officials said. The Air Force would not say whether the parts being inspected were part of the problem on the aircraft that crashed. The investigation into why that plane fell apart in flight is still ongoing and Air Force officials will not say what happened until the investigation is complete, an Air Force spokesperson said. Air Force officials said the rest of the almost 500 F-15s -- older airframes than the F-15Es -- will remain grounded until the investigation offers a solution to what happened. The E-model aircraft, the youngest and most sophisticated in the F-15 inventory, is heavily used by Central Command for ground support in the U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is also used for the homeland security mission over the United States known as Operation Noble Eagle. On November 3, the Air Force grounded all of its F-15s in response to a November 1 crash of a Missouri Air National Guard F-15C in Boss, Missouri. The grounding forced Central Command to use other Air Force, Navy and French fighters to fill the gaps, though Strike Eagles did fly to support troops in battle in Afghanistan as an emergency measure while they were still under grounding orders, according to Central Command reports. The plane that crashed, built in 1980, was one of the older F-15s in the fleet. The F-15E Strike Eagle is an air-to-ground and air-to-air fighter, making it more versatile than other F-15 models, which are used for only air-to-air missions. The Strike Eagle is used in Afghanistan and Iraq in its air-to-ground role, using its advanced sensors to drop bombs on targets.

Raymond Soeoth, pictured here with his wife, says he was injected with drugs by ICE agents against his will. One of the drugs in question is the potent anti-psychotic drug Haldol, which is often used to treat schizophrenia or other mental illnesses. Doctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered. Two immigrants, Raymond Soeoth of Indonesia and Amadou Diouf of Senegal in West Africa, told CNN they were injected with the drugs against their will. Both are plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the government. They are seeking an end to the alleged practice and unspecified damages.  Watch why the former detainees claim abuse \u00bb . Dr. Paul Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry, law and ethics at Columbia University, reviewed both men's medical records for this report and was stunned by what he discovered. \"I'm really shocked to find out that the government has been using physicians and using potent medications in this way,\" said Appelbaum, who also serves as a member of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law. \"That is the sort of thing that would be subject to a malpractice claim in the civilian world.\" The allegations of ICE forcibly drugging deportees were raised last month by Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, during the re-nomination hearing of ICE chief Julie Myers. \"The information the committee has received from ICE regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling, particularly since it appears ICE may have violated its own detention standards,\" Lieberman spokeswoman Leslie Phillips told CNN in an e-mail. \"Senator Lieberman intends to follow up with ICE to ensure that detainees are not drugged unless there is a medical reason to do so.\" ACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham, who is representing Soeoth and Diouf, said, \"It would be torture to give a powerful anti-psychotic drug to somebody who isn't even mentally ill. ... But here, it's happening on U.S. soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport.\" Responding to Lieberman's written questions, Myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had \"medical escorts\" for deportation since 2003. From October last year to the end of April this year, she said 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process. Of those, 33 detainees received medication \"because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and/or self,\" she said. \"First, I am aware of, and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ICE detention standards,\" Myers said. She added no detainee should be \"involuntarily medicated without court order,\" except in emergency situations. But both Soeoth and Diouf say they had not exhibited any combative behavior. Soeoth, a Christian minister from Indonesia, spent 27 months in detention awaiting deportation after his bid for political asylum was rejected. Hours before he was to be sent back home on December 7, 2004, he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days. See the document that shows Soeoth was injected . \"They pushed me on the bench, they opened my pants, and they just give me injection,\" he said through broken English. He says he was taken to Los Angeles International Airport while in this drug-induced stupor, but two hours before takeoff, airline security refused to transport him, so ICE agents returned him to his cell at Terminal Island near Los Angeles. Terminal Island, once a federal prison, is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation. Soeoth's medical records indicate he was injected with Cogentin and Haldol, even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness. In the records, the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark Soeoth denies ever making. ICE said in a written statement it couldn't respond to specific allegations due to pending litigation. \"Department of Homeland Security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees,\" the ICE statement said. \"Only trained and qualified medical professionals, including officers of the U.S. Public Health Service, may prescribe or administer medication.\" But, Diouf says, he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported. He said he even had a federal stay of his deportation -- and the paperwork to prove it -- but his U.S. government escorts wouldn't let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country. See Diouf's stay of deportation document . That's when, he says, \"I was wrestled to the ground and injected through my clothes.\" A government report says he was medicated because he did not follow orders. In both cases, Diouf and Soeoth remain in the United States pending a decision in the case. If they lose, they may land back in the hands of ICE, once again facing deportation. Soeoth says he's traumatized by what happened. \"I know this country [is] very generous to immigrants,\" he says. \"What they did to me was very, very bad.\" E-mail to a friend .

Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, of Nevada is being sought as a suspect in the videotaped rape of a young girl. The mother did not know her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until last Friday, Jerry T. Donohue said. \"A family friend called her and said, 'My God, you need to turn on the TV. I believe that is your daughter,'\" he said. Donohue said the mother recognized the suspect, Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, a former animal trainer. The abuse most likely occurred while the mother - a single woman working six days a week - was at work, Donohue said. The attorney said he knows who the baby sitter is, but would not release that information because of the ongoing investigation. Earlier, officials had said the girl, who is now 7, was 3-years-old at the time the video was made. But Donohue said Tuesday, \"To my understanding, the abuse occurred before she was 3 years old.\" The mother of the girl asked that the news media leave the family alone. \"I want to ask you, the press, to respect my family's privacy and to not attempt to contact my daughter or myself,\" the mother said in a written statement read by her attorney.  Watch Donohue read the mother's statement \u00bb . The mother also said she is cooperating with investigators and that her daughter \"is safe and healthy.\" The girl's videotaped rape set off a nationwide search last week. She was found Friday with family in Las Vegas, Nevada, after thousands of tips poured in. Professionals have since evaluated her and she appears to be \"healthy and fine and happy,\" the lawyer said. The lawyer said neither he nor the mother has watched the videotape. Asked whether the mother is thankful to the news media for having published the girl's picture so that authorities were able to identify her, Donohue said, \"Not really ... there's some things maybe you don't want to know.\" Still, he said, he hopes the man in the tape is brought to justice. \"Speaking as a father myself, I wish the guy would dig a hole in the desert and put a gun in his mouth,\" he said, referring to such an outcome as \"Wild-West justice.\" Meanwhile, the intense manhunt for Stiles continued Tuesday. On Monday, Stiles' former girlfriend, Tina Allen, told CNN she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is \"mortified\" by the allegations against him. Allen said she and Stiles were in an on-again, off-again relationship for 10 years until recently, when she called it off. \"He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,\" Allen said. Allen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, who allegedly was victimized by Stiles. \"I'm disgusted. I'm ashamed, embarrassed, mortified,\" Allen said of the alleged rape. \"I regret every, every step I ever took, I feel bad for the baby.\" The FBI is also seeking Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, in a separate matter involving state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14. Pahrump is about 60 miles west of Las Vegas. A man who said he found the tape in the desert and held it for at least five months before handing it over to authorities turned himself in Sunday to Nye County officials.

Hillary Clinton as helping to give President Bush a \"blank check\" to take military action against Iran. Sen. Barack Obama says Sen. Hillary Clinton has shown \"flawed\" judgment. \"We know in the past that the president has used some of the flimsiest excuses to try to move his agenda regardless of what Congress says,\" Obama said in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Last month, Clinton voted to support a resolution declaring Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite part of the Iranian military, a foreign terrorist group. (The nonbinding amendment to the Defense Authorization Act passed by a 76-22 vote.) Obama said he would have voted against the measure but didn't because he was campaigning in New Hampshire at the time. He said it was impossible to know when votes will be scheduled in the Senate. \"This is a problem\" related to running for president, he said. Obama said Clinton also had shown \"flawed\" judgment during the vote to authorize the Iraq war five years ago. \"We know that there was embodied in this legislation, or this resolution sent to the Senate, language that would say our Iraqi troop structures should in part be determined by our desire to deal with Iran,\" Obama said. \"Now if you know that in the past the president has taken a blank check and cashed it, we don't want to repeat that mistake.\" Clinton on Thursday defended her vote on the resolution during an interview on New Hampshire Public Radio, saying \"what I voted on was a nonbinding resolution. It's not an amendment. It's not a law.\" While Clinton was campaigning Sunday in New Hampton, Iowa, an audience member at a town hall-style meeting pressed her on why she voted for the Iran measure and asked why she hadn't learned from past \"mistakes.\" Calling \"the premise of the question\" wrong, the senator from New York argued the resolution calls for the terrorist label so that sanctions can be imposed. The sanctions, Clinton said, will in turn \"send a clear message to the leadership\" and lead to stronger diplomatic efforts. Earlier this month, Clinton also co-sponsored legislation with Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, that would prohibit military operations against Iran without congressional approval. Obama's comments came on the fifth anniversary of the 77-23 Senate vote that authorized the president to use force against Iraq. Obama, then an Illinois state senator, spoke out against the resolution authorizing force at the time. Clinton's 2002 vote shows a clear difference in judgment between the two of them, Obama said.  Watch as Obama questions Clinton's judgment \u00bb . \"I don't think it disqualified her, but I think it speaks to her judgment and it speaks to my judgment,\" Obama said. \"It speaks to how we will make decisions going forward. \"I think her judgment was flawed on this issue.\" Obama said he also will step up efforts to clarify his differences with Clinton, whom many political observers view as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. \"There's no doubt we are moving into a different phase of the campaign,\" Obama said. \"The first part of a campaign is to offer some biography and give people a sense of where I've been and what I am about. \"In this next phase, we want to make sure that voters understand that on big issues, like the decision to go into the war in Iraq, I had real differences with the other candidates, and that reflects on my judgment.\" Another leading Democratic candidate, John Edwards, also voted in 2002 to authorize force in Iraq while he was then a senator from North Carolina. He later called his vote a mistake. In a veiled swipe at Clinton, Obama also suggested he could better unite the country and offer \"something new,  as opposed to looking backward and simply duplicating some of the politics that we've become so accustomed to, that frankly the American people are sick of.\" Obama would not say whether he would consider Clinton as his running mate should he become the Democratic Party's nominee. \"I think Sen. Clinton is a very capable person,\" he said. \"Right now, my goal is to make sure I am the nominee, and she is still the senator from New York.\" E-mail to a friend .

Charges have now been reduced against at least five of the students in the racially charged \"Jena 6\" case. Charges against Jesse Ray Beard, who was 14 at the time of the alleged crime, are unavailable because he's a juvenile. Civil rights leaders Martin Luther King III and Al Sharpton led more than 15,000 marchers to Jena -- a town of about 3,000 -- in September to protest how authorities handled the cases against Purvis and five other teens accused of the December 2006 beating of fellow student Justin Barker.

T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested without incident in midtown Atlanta. The entertainer, whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested Saturday just hours before he was scheduled to perform at the BET Hip Hop Awards. The small court room of Magistrate Judge Alan Baverman was packed with family, supporters and media, but even more people, including the rapper's mother, were turned away because of the overcrowding. Harris, 27, was arrested in a federal sting after his bodyguard-turned-informant delivered three machine guns and two silencers to the hip-hop star, according to a Justice Department statement.  Watch a search of the rapper's home \u00bb . He was held in federal custody over the weekend. Authorities said that Harris provided the bodyguard $12,000 to buy the weapons, which Harris is not allowed to own because he is a convicted felon. Court documents said Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in 1998, and a federal affidavit said he has been arrested on gun charges in the past. However, one of his attorneys, Dwight Thomas, said he was not aware Harris was a convicted felon and that \"a number of people\" live in Harris' suburban Atlanta home. Thomas added there were \"two sides to every story -- sometimes three\" and he was confident the legal system would work in Harris' favor. The entertainer was taken into custody about 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Atlanta, where the BET award show was taped. Harris, the show's top nominee, was up for nine awards, including CD of the year and lyricist of the year. He also was scheduled to perform, along with fellow rap stars Common, Nelly and Kanye West. Harris won two awards. The show went on without the self-proclaimed \"King of the South,\" whose car and home in the Atlanta suburb of College Park were searched after his arrest. Authorities said they found three more firearms in the car in which Harris drove to pick up the machine guns and silencers, \"including one loaded gun tucked between the driver's seat where Harris had been sitting and the center console.\" At his home, authorities found six other guns, five of them loaded, in his bedroom closet. \"Machine guns pose a serious danger to the community, which is why they are so carefully regulated,\" said David Nahmias, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia. \"The last place machine guns should be is in the hands of a convicted felon, who cannot legally possess any kind of firearm. This convicted felon allegedly was trying to add several machine guns to an already large and entirely illegal arsenal of guns.\" The sting came after Harris' bodyguard was arrested purchasing the machine guns and silencers from an undercover Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Wednesday, according to the Justice Department statement. The bodyguard then agreed to cooperate with the ATF, the statement said. The guns were not registered on the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record as required by law. The bodyguard -- who has worked for Harris since July -- told authorities he had bought about nine guns for the rap star in the past, the statement said. On Wednesday, authorities said, Harris arranged for the bodyguard to pick up $12,000 in cash from a bank to buy the guns. After his arrest, the bodyguard made phone calls to Harris, which authorities recorded, the statement said. Harris was supposed to meet the bodyguard in a shopping center parking lot in midtown Atlanta to pick up the guns. Authorities arrested Harris there without incident, the Justice Department statement said. Court documents in the case show Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in Cobb County, Georgia, in 1998 and sentenced to seven years' probation. \"Harris has additional arrests and at least one probation violation for unlawfully possessing firearms,\" according to an affidavit. Harris' music is built around the drug culture and is known as \"trap musik,\" the name of Harris' second album. A \"trap\" is Southern slang for a drug house.

Proenza said if it were to fail, forecast tracks could be thrown off by as much as 16 percent. He said Washington reprimanded him for the remarks: \"They wanted me to be quiet about it.\" But one of the center's longtime forecasters said Proenza's comments were misguided. \"QuikSCAT is another tool that we use to forecast,\" Lixion Avila said. \"The forecast will not be degraded if we don't have the QuikSCAT.\" Last week, the Commerce Department launched an unscheduled review of the hurricane center after word of the staff's dissatisfaction started to become public. His staffers on Thursday issued a petition calling for him to step down.  Watch how Proenza lost the confidence of his staff \u00bb . The petition said the center's \"effective functioning\" is at stake as the Atlantic hurricane season heads toward its peak. \"The undersigned staff ... has concluded that the center needs a new director, and with the heart of the hurricane season fast approaching, urges the Department of Commerce to make this happen as quickly as possible,\" said the petition, which was signed by twenty-three people, including four of five senior hurricane specialists. Hurricane center staffers told CNN's John Zarella they were unhappy not only about his comments about the QuikSCAT, but also about the environment at the center -- one characterized by closed doors and the public airing of dirty laundry. Proenza on Friday told CNN he had contacted his superiors in Washington about \"ways to move forward,\" but added, \"I am not going to resign.\" Proenza told CNN he did not think the staff should dictate the leadership through \"signing petitions.\" Proenza graduated from Florida State University with a degree in meteorology. He began his career in tropical meteorology in the mid-1960s at NHC and as a meteorologist on the \"hurricane hunter\" aircraft, according to his biography posted on the agency's Web site. He continued within the National Weather Service for more than 35 years, \"receiving numerous performance commendations and awards, including recognition from the NWS Employees' Organization as the NWS manager of the year for his collaborative leadership,\" the bio said.

Families stand amid the wreckage caused by the cyclone Friday in southern Bangladesh. Brig. Gen. Qazi Abedus Samad, director of operations for the country's armed forces, told CNN Saturday the toll had reached 1,723, and the figure is expected to rise. As flood waters recede, aid workers say they expect to find scores more bodies when remote villages are finally reached and the counting is done. They face debris-blocked roads, no electricity and almost nonexistent communications. In addition to the dead, another 15,000 people have been injured. Thousands of people have been displaced and many are still missing. Cyclone Sidr, with sustained winds of at least 131 mph (210 kph), made landfall Thursday night along the western coast of Bangladesh near the border with India, unleashing floodwaters. Government spokesman Fahim Munaim told CNN by telephone that the government held an emergency Cabinet meeting Saturday to assess the disaster and discuss recovery issues. He said the extent of the cyclone's damage may be much worse because emergency relief had not been able to reach remote areas. The government has identified the 12 worst districts -- all of them located on the southern coast -- out of the 23 affected by the cyclone, Munaim said.  See victims pick up the pieces after the storm \u00bb . The Bangladeshi air force, army and navy are working to provide shelter for the many people who have been displaced. Power is still out in much of the country but it is being restored.  Watch how the cyclone spawns a large relief effort \u00bb . Vince Edwards, national director of the relief agency World Vision in Bangladesh, said the high wind speeds of Cyclone Sidr have laid waste to the all-important rice crop and caused a huge loss of livestock. He said 280,000 families have been rendered homeless by the cyclone, but many have been able to get shelter from family members. World Vision is deploying 135 staffers and 7,000 volunteers to provide food, shelter and other relief. The group is appealing for $1.5 million in further funds to assist some 9.300 families rebuild their homes. In Dhaka -- about 200 miles north of the worst-hit region -- there were power outages, massive traffic jams and spotty phone service, CNN's Cal Perry said from the city. \"From an infrastructure perspective, the country absolutely has been brought to its knees,\" he said. Red Crescent spokeswoman Nabiha Chowdhury told CNN that communication with her agency's teams who have arrived in the stricken area is spotty, but they have resources with them to immediately help people with water purification, which she said was a top priority. Those teams have cash with them to buy relief supplies from local wholesalers, said Chowdhury, who said the latest number of people injured was 15,000 with 1,000 missing. Chowdhury said about 600,000 people had fled, adding that about 2 million people lived along the coast. The U.N. World Food Programme said it has enough high-energy biscuits to feed 400,000 people for several days. Another humanitarian group, Save The Children, appealed for aid from the public. \"Many families have lost everything, including their homes and their crops, and they are struggling to survive,\" said Kelly Stevenson, Save the Children's Bangladesh director. \"We are appealing to the U.S. public to support our efforts to assist children and families affected by this disaster. We remain very concerned about possible outbreaks of cholera and severe diarrhea due to the lack of access to clean water,\" he said in a written statement. The U.S. Department of State pledged Friday pledging \"to work with the government and foreign donors to assist in relieving the effects of the disaster.\" Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the U.S. Mission in Bangladesh, anticipating the storm, pre-positioned 16 Zodiac boats, water treatment systems, water ambulances and food for a more rapid response. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates was expected to approve plans to send up to three Navy amphibious warships, with up to 3,500 Marines, to locations off the coast of Bangladesh to assist in relief efforts.

A photo taken by I-Reporter Casanova Love shows a noose hanging from a pickup in Alexandria, Louisiana. Jeremiah Munsen, 18, of Grant Parish, repeatedly drove slowly past a group of marchers gathered at a bus depot in Alexandria, which is near Jena, as they awaited buses to return them to Tennessee, federal authorities said Thursday. As many as 20,000 marchers had taken part in the huge protests in Jena. Authorities there had been accused of injustice in the handling of racially charged cases, including the hanging of nooses in a tree after a group of black high school students sat in an area where traditionally only white students sat. The noose incident at Jena was the beginning of months of racial tension that included the beating of a white student, allegedly by six black classmates. The black students were prosecuted, but the three white students responsible for the nooses in the tree were not. Munsen and an unnamed conspirator had attached nooses to their pickup on September 20 and driven to Alexandria specifically to threaten and intimidate the marchers, the authorities said.  View a series of photos of the truck \u00bb . A juvenile passenger was apprehended with Munsen, according to the arresting officer's report. The juvenile told police he and his family are in the Ku Klux Klan and that he had \"KKK\" tattooed on his chest, the police report said. He also said that he tied the nooses and that brass knuckles found in the truck belonged to him, the report said. \"This indictment accuses the defendant [Munsen] of conduct that constitutes a federal civil rights conspiracy violation and a federal hate crime,\" said U.S. Attorney Donald Washington.

The U.S. government wants to build a border fence like this one. About 100 landowners are fighting it. Tamez owns three acres of land along the Texas-Mexico border where the Department of Homeland Security would like to build a border fence. The property is a remnant of a 12,000-acre grant from Spain to her family in 1767, before the United States even existed. \"It is my history. It is my heritage,\" Tamez said. This week, the Justice Department began legal action against landowners and municipalities who have refused to give government surveyors access to their land. Tamez expects she will be sued sometime soon, but she is not intimidated. Asked how long she will fight, she said, \"As long as I have to.\" Michael Chertoff, the Secretary of Homeland Security, said the fence will not be stopped by opponents like Tamez. \"Can we simply abandon an enterprise because it is a problem for a particular individual?\" Chertoff told CNN. \"I don't think I can accept that.\"  Watch Chertoff say it's \"civic responsibility\" to give up land \u00bb . Chertoff believes a fence would curb the steady stream of illegal immigrants making their way across the border and lessen the flow of drugs. He also argues it will increase the safety of Border Patrol agents who have faced increasing violence. The government wants to build 700 miles of fence along the Mexican border, including 370 miles of it by the end of this year. About 70 miles of fence is to be built in the Rio Grande Valley by year's end, if the government gets its way. The Rio Grande forms a natural barrier along this stretch of the border, but in some places it is narrow enough to swim across. On the banks of the river there is ample evidence that people do so. Piles of underwear lie discarded by swimmers after they make it across. The swimmers change into dry clothes they have carried across in plastic bags. Then they disappear into the United States. The Border Patrol has stepped up its efforts in the Rio Grande Valley with more lights, and sensors to pick up movement. A levee built along the river has a muddy road on top used by Border Patrol vehicles to patrol the area. Richard Cortez, the mayor of the border town of McAllen, Texas, believes hiring more Border Patrol agents, deepening the Rio Grande, and clearing its banks of tall vegetation would provide better border protection than the fence. Cortez calls the fence \"a multibillion-dollar speed bump,\" which will slow, but not stop, illegal immigration. \"It is a false sense of security,\" he said. \"America will not be safe. America will continue to waste resources on something that is not going to work.\" Cortez and other border mayors who oppose construction of the fence formed a group called the Texas Border Coalition. The coalition wrote to Chertoff asking for further consultations on the fence, but this week the Department of Homeland Security turned them down. While expressing support for open dialogue with residents and officials, David Pagan of U.S. Customs and Border Protection wrote in an e-mail, \"We do not plan to suspend work on the construction of fence in order to hold a series of additional consultation meetings.\" Cortez said his city is contemplating a court test of the law that mandated the construction of the border fence. And so a battle is being waged by about 100 landowners, those like Eloisa Tamez who are standing firm.   \"I will not allow them to come and survey my land. I have an American-given right to protect my property,\" she said.

Rev, Charles Kennedy uses Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's book during a Friday night sermon. Scientologists do not worship God, much less Jesus Christ. The church has seen plenty of controversy and critics consider it a cult. So why are observant Christians embracing some of its teachings? Two pastors who spoke recently with CNN explained that when it comes to religion, they still preach the core beliefs of Christianity. But when it comes to practicing what they preach in a modern world, borrowing from Scientology helps. The Rev. Charles Kennedy, of the Glorious Church of God in Christ, a Pentecostal church in Tampa, Florida, and the Rev. James McLaughlin, of the Wayman Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Houston, Texas, are among the theological hybrids.  Watch Rev. Kennedy preach \u00bb . They say they are not scared off by programs with ties to a church that critics say has aggressive recruiting, secretive ways and rigid theology. As men of God rooted in Christian values, they do not see Scientology as a threat to their faith, but rather as a tool to augment it. Scientology was founded in the 1950s by L. Ron Hubbard, a science fiction writer. Followers are taught that they are immortal spiritual beings called thetans. Although the church says there is a supreme being, its practices do not include worshipping God. \"I'm looking for solutions, and the people that I help, they don't ask me who L. Ron Hubbard is,\" said McLaughlin, who works with addicts. \"You know what they say? 'Thank God.' \" Critic Rick Ross, a court-certified Scientology expert, sees something more sinister at work. He warned that mainstream acceptance makes it easier for the Scientologists to achieve their ultimate goal -- new recruits. \"Their hope is that through these programs, people will become more interested in L. Ron Hubbard, what else Mr. Hubbard had to offer, and this will lead them eventually to Scientology,\" Ross said. The church has long been in the headlines for practices critics say are little more than cult-like mind control. It is also known for its stable of devout celebrity followers. And according to published reports, Scientology has been recently diversifying its outreach to include other religions and ethnic groups. Kennedy, McLaughlin and a handful of other Christian church leaders -- no one can say how many -- are finding answers to their communities' needs in Scientology's social programs. For Kennedy, it began two years ago when he attended a meeting at the Church of Scientology's spiritual headquarters in Clearwater, Florida. He was introduced to a book called \"The Way to Happiness\" -- Hubbard's 64-page, self-described \"common sense guide to better living.\" In the book, which lays out ways to maintain a temperate lifestyle, Kennedy found a message he believed could help lift his predominantly lower income African-American congregation. He said the book's 21 principles help them with their struggle in an urban environment where there is too much crime and addiction and too little opportunity. Kennedy knew that before he could introduce any Scientology-related text to his congregation, he would have to prove that it did not contradict his Christian beliefs. And so, he found Scripture to match each of the 21 principles. Now Kennedy uses \"The Way to Happiness\" as a how-to supplement to his sermons. He believes it is easier to understand and clearer to follow than ancient Scriptures taken from the Bible. When asked whether Scientology's values contradict the religion of Jesus Christ, Kennedy replies, \"Sometimes yes. Sometimes no.\" But he says his congregation can relate to \"The Way to Happiness.\" Kennedy admits other pastors have criticized him, but the disapproval is not enough to discourage him. He insists that he has witnessed the changes \"The Way to Happiness\" has inspired in people. He also maintains that the Scientologists, many of whom he calls friends, are successful at outreach and getting desired results. At Kennedy's C. L. Kennedy Center, free tutoring based on Hubbard's \"study tech\" philosophies is provided to dozens of children and some adults. Kennedy's daughter, Jimirra, is one of the instructors. She said \"study tech\" and the Scientology orientation classes she attended helped her graduate from high school and become a poised woman. Though Jimirra Kennedy insists she does not ascribe to the religious side of Scientology, she still considers herself, at least in part, Scientologist. \"We say this all the time and I know my father says this, but I am like a Pentecostal Scientologist, that's what we are.\" Critics like Ross are alarmed by such a blurring of the lines. They consider it a marketing win for Scientology. In Houston, McLaughlin says he is not one to argue with success. Driven by a need to address the rampant drug problem in his community, McLaughlin spent years searching for a solution before he discovered \"Narconon,\" Scientology's nonprofit drug rehab center, in 2001. McLaughlin trained at Narconon and brought the techniques back to his community to launch \"First Step Faith Step,\" a program that combines Hubbard's methods with the teachings of Christianity. He claims a 70- to 80-percent rehabilitation success rate. Kennedy and McLaughlin said they have never lost a member of their congregations to Scientology. \"I think that they truly believe that this may help their communities, but in my opinion, they're na\u00efve,\" Ross said. Scientologists, he added, \"have their own agenda.\" The Church of Scientology would not grant CNN an interview, nor would its representatives answer questions about the Hubbard-based programs.

About 2,000 Palestinian refugees are stranded in camps along the Syrian border and face difficult living conditions, including limited medical care, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. The agency has appealed for the resettlement of \"vulnerable and sick\" children in Al Waleed refugee camp at the Iraqi-Syrian border. One of those who died in the camp was a 3-year-old Palestinian boy who was suffering from rickets and pneumonia. He died a few days ago in a Ramadi hospital and then was buried in Al Waleed. The other was a 14-year-old suffering from Hodgkin's disease who died in Baghdad last week. A 50-year-old man who was waiting to be resettled died earlier this month in Al Waleed. The agency says seven people, including three children, have died at the camp since refugees fleeing attackers began arriving at the border in March 2006.

Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama will duel for Super Tuesday votes Thursday night as the Democratic presidential hopefuls face off for the first time together minus former Sen. John Edwards. Thursday's debate is taking place at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles, California. The debate -- sponsored by CNN, the Los Angeles Times and Politico -- starts at 8 p.m. ET Thursday on CNN and CNN.com. CNN's Wolf Blitzer is the moderator. The event is the first Democratic debate since Obama's convincing victory Saturday in South Carolina. On Tuesday, Clinton won the Florida primary, a contest her campaign said helped the senator regain momentum even though it awarded no delegates. The forum at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood comes hours after the Obama campaign revealed it had raised $32 million in January from roughly 170,000 new donors. That amount will allow Obama to expand his television ad buys greatly in the 20-plus states holding primaries or caucuses Tuesday.  Watch a time-lapse construction of the debate set \u00bb . The Clinton campaign would not indicate how much money it had raised in the same time period. Mike Gravel, the other Democratic presidential candidate still in the race, was not invited to participate in the debate because he did not meet certain criteria, including support in national polls. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll conducted January 14-17, Gravel received less than 1 percent. Edwards suspended his presidential run Wednesday in New Orleans, Louisiana, but he didn't endorse any candidate despite what aides described as furious lobbying campaigns by Obama and Clinton. Thursday's debate may be slightly more restrained than last week's brutal showdown. Following her South Carolina loss, Clinton has largely steered clear of opportunities to take aim at Obama. Former President Bill Clinton also has avoided criticizing his wife's rival after dominating headlines with his attacks in the days before the South Carolina vote. The economy is likely to dominate Thursday's debate, as both candidates look to appeal to supporters of Edwards and his brand of economic populism. Clinton and Obama have split victories in their parties' early-voting states: Obama has won in Iowa and South Carolina, and Clinton has won in New Hampshire, Nevada, Michigan and Florida. But the Michigan and Florida contests awarded no delegates, and all major Democratic presidential candidates pledged to avoid campaigning in those states following national party penalties against them for moving up their contests so early. Clinton was the only major candidate to appear on the Michigan ballot. Obama is leading Clinton in the number of pledged delegates -- those awarded based on primary or caucus votes. Clinton has the edge when superdelegates are factored in. (Superdelegates are party leaders and elected officials who are not obligated to support a particular candidate. They can change their decisions at any time leading up to the Democratic National Convention in August.) To date, Obama has won an estimated 63 national convention delegates as a result of primary or caucus votes, while Clinton has earned an estimated 48 delegates. Clinton, however, has the overall lead in delegates -- 232 to 158 -- when superdelegates are included. With solid fundraising numbers and a nod from Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts this week, Obama will be making the claim he holds the front-runner title. But Clinton -- who has led in national surveys for much of the race -- will be making her case as well. E-mail to a friend .

Lebanese soldiers and Red Cross workers stand near charred cars at the site of the explosion in Beirut. The driver of the embassy vehicle suffered minor injuries, and the sole passenger walked away unscathed, U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said. Both were Lebanese nationals, he said. An American citizen who happened to be in the area suffered non-life-threatening injuries, the spokesman said. Lebanese internal security forces said three Lebanese civilian bystanders were killed in the explosion in Beirut's Dora area, contradicting earlier reports of four. Twenty-one others -- including the American bystander -- were wounded in the explosion, which was caused by a 15-kilogram (33-pound) bomb placed in a car before the explosion, the security forces said. The United States is outraged by the terrorist attack, said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is traveling with President Bush in Saudi Arabia. \"I want on behalf of our country to say to those who were wounded, and certainly to the families of those who were killed, that our condolences are with them,\" she added. It was not clear whether the blast was caused by a suicide attack or by a remotely detonated car bomb. A communique issued by the U.S. Embassy in Beirut said the embassy vehicle was apparently the intended target of the attack, and identified the driver and passenger as Lebanese security personnel for the embassy. But McCormack cautioned against jumping to any conclusions on the intended target. \"We don't yet have a full picture of exactly what happened, who is responsible, who is exactly being targeted,\" he told reporters during the State Department's daily briefing. \"We will see over the next day or two ... where the facts lead us.\" Citing security concerns, McCormack would also not address unconfirmed reports that the vehicle was part of a convoy for departing U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Jeffrey Feltman. A U.S. Embassy statement said Feltman canceled a farewell ceremony that he was to host Tuesday night \"out of respect to the victims of today's terrorist explosion.\" In addition to the American, an Iraqi and at least three Lebanese were among those wounded in the blast, according to a Western diplomatic source. Video of the scene showed several damaged cars, including at least one that was left a pile of twisted metal. A nearby high-rise building also sustained damage. Mohammed Chatah, senior adviser to Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, pointed out that the attack happened during \"a major political crisis\" in Lebanon, which has been without a president for nearly eight weeks amid a bitter political feud. \"This explosion just exacerbates a difficult situation,\" Chatah told CNN. Tuesday's blast appears to be the latest in a series of attacks against pro-Western, anti-Syrian targets in the Lebanese capital. Most recently, an explosion in Beirut's Christian suburb of Baabda killed Brig. Gen. Francois Al-Hajj, the head of operations for the Lebanese army, and his bodyguard on December 12. Al-Hajj was believed to be a top candidate to take over as army commander in the event current commander Gen. Michel Suleiman was elected to replace Emile Lahoud as president. Lebanon has been in the midst of a political crisis as pro- and anti-Syrian lawmakers in parliament are locked in a battle to elect a new president. The nation has been without a president since November 23, when the pro-Syrian Lahoud stepped down at the end of his term. In February 2005, the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in Beirut sparked widespread protests that led to the ouster of Syrian forces from Lebanon. E-mail to a friend .

Former New York Yankee Bobby Murcer warms up  during Old Timers Day Yankee Stadium on July 7. Our first story has a fairy-tale middle and a horrible ending. In August of '77, Bobby Murcer of the Cubs promised to hit a home run for terminally ill fan Scott Crull. That night, Murcer hit two of them. Pretty amazing, especially when you consider Murcer only hit nine homers the whole next season. But that's not why Crull -- a 12-year-old from Calumet City, Illinois -- makes this list. Broadcasting the game nationally on ABC, Keith Jackson told the country how Murcer had fulfilled the dying boy's last wish. Eyes watered, spines tingled. There was only one problem -- nobody had ever told the boy he was dying. His parents were horrified. Weeks later, Crull passed away. 2. The good luck charmers . Every sport has its own strange traditions. I'd argue hockey's \"throwing an octopus on the ice for good luck\" is the weirdest. Tossing the eight-tentacled cephalopod was the brainchild of Detroit storeowners Pete & Jerry Cusimano. The date: April 15, 1952. The logic: one tentacle for each of the eight victories it took to win the Stanley Cup. Later that spring, most likely fueled by the good luck octopus, the Red Wings won the title. PETA has objected to this practice, which continues to this day. The Red Wings mascot is not a Red Wing, but Al the Octopus. 3. The John 3:16 guy . Also known as \"Rainbow Man,\" the born-again Rollen Stewart and his John 3:16 signs were fixtures at major events in the 1970s and 80s. He brought his message to the World Series, Super Bowl, Olympics, and World Cup. He was outside Buckingham Palace when Di and Charles wed; he went to see the Pope in Alaska. But he was more religious fanatic than sports fan. According to the Los Angeles Times, Stewart planned to assassinate President Bush and candidate Clinton in 1992. And he's now serving three life sentences for holding a maid hostage at a Los Angeles Hyatt, also in 1992. By the way, chapter three, verse sixteen of the Gospel of John says, \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" This is also printed on cups at the In-N-Out Burger. 4. The All-Star heckler . For 12 years, Maryland lawyer and Washington Bullets fan Robin Ficker was the NBA's most prominent heckler. With season tickets behind the visiting team's bench, his antics were legendary. When he reminded Frank Layden of the Jazz that \"USA Today\" had rated him Worst Dressed Coach, Layden had to be restrained by security. With the Bulls in town, Ficker loudly read excerpts of Maverick, coach Phil Jackson's sex-laden 1975 autobiography. During the 1993 Suns-Bulls NBA Finals, Charles Barkley (of the Suns) flew Ficker to Phoenix and bought him a ticket behind the Chicago bench. Ficker was ejected in the first quarter. The Bullets became the Wizards in 1997 and moved into the MCI Center the following season. Ficker's new seats were not in shouting distance of the visiting team, forcing him into heckling retirement. Last year he received 9.5% of the vote in a losing bid for Montgomery County Executive. 5. Kim Jong-il . That's right, the world's most feared dictator is a hoops junkie. During a 2000 visit, then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright presented him a basketball signed by Michael Jordan. The Chicago Bulls are the favorite team of Kim Jong-il, who reportedly has a video library with every game Jordan ever played. At 5'3\", the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army is roughly the same height as Muggsy Bogues. 6. David Letterman's Stalker . David Letterman's biggest fan was also his biggest headache. When she was arrested for stealing Dave's Porsche in 1988, Margaret Ray told police she was Mrs. Letterman. She was a frequent trespasser on Dave's estate, once camping out on his tennis court. Ray's antics made her a regular monologue target. But the jokes stopped in 1998, when Ray jumped in front of a moving train. The collective guilt spread when we learned she was schizophrenic, as were her two brothers, who also committed suicide. 7. Joe from Saddle River . A die-hard Jets, Mets and Rangers fan, Joe Benigno was a frequent caller to WFAN, New York's all-sports radio station. Benigno won the station's Fan Appreciation Day contest in 1994, earning a chance to guest-host his own show. By 1995, Joe was WFAN's overnight guy, a title he held for almost a decade. In 2004, he was deemed ready for daytime and given the 10 a.m.-1p.m. timeslot. For all the lonely and passionate talk radio callers out there, Joe gives hope. 8. Steffi Graf's biggest fanatic . Deranged and obsessed with seeing Steffi Graf return to the top of the rankings, Gunter Parche stabbed Monica Seles during a 1993 match in one of the most disturbing incidents in sports history. Almost as disturbing was his punishment. Parche received a two-year suspended sentence and was ordered to attend mandatory counseling.

Doctors in Britain are now taking legal advice to see if they are permitted to carry out the hysterectomy on Katie Thorpe, who suffers from cerebral palsy. But a charity campaigning for the disabled said on Monday the move could infringe human rights and would set a \"disturbing precedent.\" Andy Rickell, executive director of disability charity Scope, told the Press Association: \"It is very difficult to see how this kind of invasive surgery, which is not medically necessary and which will be very painful and traumatic, can be in Katie's best interests. \"This case raises fundamental ethical issues about the way our society treats disabled people and the respect we have for disabled people's human and reproductive rights.  Watch why the surgery is so controversial \u00bb . \"If this enforced sterilization is approved, it will have disturbing implications for young disabled girls across Britain.\" Katie's mother Alison Thorpe, who lives in Billericay, southern England, said the operation was in her daughter's best interests. \"First of all, this is not about me. If it was about me, I would have given up caring for Katie a long, long while ago,\" she told GMTV. \"It is about quality of life and for Katie to not have the associated problems of menstruation adds to her quality of life. It means she can continue with the quality of life we can give her now. \"Katie wouldn't understand menstruation at all. She has no comprehension about what will be happening to her body. All she would feel is the discomfort, the stomach cramps and the headaches, the mood swings, the tears, and wonder what is going on.\" Thorpe said an operation would be best for Katie, despite the initial pain it would cause. She added: \"The short-term pain and discomfort we can manage with painkillers. We will be able to manage that pain much better than menstruation once a month, when Katie cannot tell us 'I'm in pain.'\"  E-mail to a friend .", "066f8568d9c1c23ca3aeb23330123e7dd8967208": "(CNN) -- The Chinese government is bracing itself for a rush of people wishing to marry when the summer Olympics kick off on August 8 -- because the number carries a special significance in Chinese culture, the state news agency said Sunday.

Nearly 3,400 couples got hitched on the day last year, some waiting all night outside the marriage registration office in Beijing. This year, the civil affairs bureau is accepting online reservations for marriage registrations for the day.

Goalscorer Nihat gets a kiss from team-mate Altintop after Turkey sealed their place with a 1-0 win over Bosnia. The result ended Norway's hopes of snatching qualification despite their 4-1 victory away to Malta with Steffen Iversen scoring a first half hat-trick.

The attack on Samarra's al-Askariya mosque set off violence between Sunnis and Shiites. Haitham Sabah al-Badri, the al Qaeda emir of greater Samarra, was killed by an airstrike Thursday east of Samarra, said Rear Adm. Mark Fox during a news conference. \"Eliminating al-Badri is another step in breaking the cycle of violence instigated by the attack on the holy shrine in Samarra,\" Fox said. \"We will continue to hunt down the brutal terrorists who are intent on creating a Taliban-like state in Iraq.\" Coalition forces Thursday raided four buildings outside Samarra that were associated with al-Badri, according to a U.S. military news release. During the raid, at least four armed men were seen leaving the buildings and setting up tactical fighting positions in an effort to ambush coalition forces, the release said. The coalition forces called in close air support, killing al-Badri and the three others, the release said. One of those killed was identified as a foreigner; al-Badri was identified by his close associates and relatives, the military said. El-Badri's death was first reported Saturday by a high-ranking Iraqi Interior Ministry official. No one was injured in the attack on the Golden Mosque, one of the holiest Shiite sites, but thousands have been killed by the death squads and reprisal bombings that have ravaged Iraq in the 17\u00bd months since the attack. In addition to the February attack that collapsed the mosque's dome, another bombing in June destroyed the shrine's two remaining minarets. Al-Badri is believed to have been involved in other attacks, including two last year, Fox said -- the June 23 bombing of a Kirkuk courthouse that left 20 Iraqis dead and the August 28 attack at a Samarra checkpoint that killed 29 Iraqi soldiers. Samarra is in Salaheddin province, north of Baghdad. Mortar attacks kill 11 . Two mortar rounds struck a gas station in a mainly Shiite neighborhood in eastern Baghdad on Sunday, killing at least 11 people and wounding 15 others, a spokesman with Iraq's Interior Ministry said. The attack in the Afdhailiya neighborhood happened about 8 a.m. (12 a.m. ET), the spokesman said. Suicide bombers attacked two gas stations Wednesday, killing 70 people, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, coalition forces said Saturday they killed four suspected militants and detained 18 thought to have helped make or plant roadside bombs, the U.S. military said. The militants were suspected of coordinating logistical support from Iran for elements of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army and other Shiite militias operating in Iraq, the military said. Iraqi family upset with U.S. soldier's sentence . A U.S. soldier has been sentenced to 110 years in confinement for participating in the rape of a 14-year-old girl and the killings of her and her family in Iraq, an Army spokeswoman said. The girl's family told Reuters on Sunday they were dismayed by the punishment and would have preferred to see the death penalty handed down in the case. Pfc. Jesse Spielman was convicted Friday of rape, conspiracy to commit rape, housebreaking with the intent to commit rape and four counts of felony murder. The girl, her parents and younger sister were shot dead in March 2006 in Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad. \"We were expecting the death penalty against those criminals and the place to carry out the sentence is where the incident happened,\" the girl's cousin, Abu Ammar, told Reuters. Her uncle, Hadi Abdullah, told the wire agency that family members wished there was a way to appeal the sentence so the death penalty could be imposed.

I love the students, faculty, staff and administration, and I want to see God's best for them,\" Roberts wrote in his resignation letter. Roberts' decision was effective immediately and came as the school fought a wrongful termination lawsuit filed by three professors who accused him and his wife of misconduct. John Swails, Tim Brooker and Paulita Brooker said they lost their jobs after reporting information indicating that Roberts and his family lavishly spent school money for personal expenses.

Amin Gemayel (R), Phalange party head, carries the coffin of assassinated deputy Antoine Ghamen. Against an atmosphere of intense political and patriotic fervor, the flag-draped coffins of the politician and two bodyguards also killed in Wednesday's rush hour blast made its way through the city's Christian district to the Sacred Heart church on what the government had declared as a day of national mourning. The procession was accompanied by thousands waving flags, as well as a brass band playing the anthem of Ghanem's Phalange Party, The Associated Press reported . TV pictures showed distraught mourners crowding and reaching out to the coffins as they were carried aloft. Several people were seen to collapse and had to be carried away. Mourners also carried photographs, threw rose petals and unfurled banners, some of which read \"We Won't Kneel,\" AP said. The coffins were greeted at the Christian Maronite church with applause from the gathered mourners, the agency said, including majority leaders and the Lebanese cabinet as well as Ghanem's family and friends. Ghanem was later buried in the city's Christian district. Ghanem's death is the latest in a series of attacks targeting prominent anti-Syrian figures, with the most notorious being the February 2005 assassination in Beirut of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which sparked widespread protests that led to the ouster of Syrian forces from Lebanon.

Bush's statement added: \"The United States opposes any attempts to intimidate the Lebanese people as they seek to exercise their democratic right to select a president without foreign interference. We will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Lebanese people as they resist attempts by the Syrian and Iranian regimes and their allies to destabilize Lebanon and undermine its sovereignty.\" The U.S. Embassy in Beirut issued a statement saying: \"It is not a coincidence that these attacks target those figures who have been working to secure Lebanon's independence from renewed Syrian hegemony. We note with concern that many Lebanese politicians allied with Syria have in fact warned that murder and violence would be the results of any effort to exercise genuine parliamentary democracy.\" And U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, in a written statement, said: \"The bombing that claimed these lives was another act in a campaign of terror by those who want to turn back the clock on Lebanon's hard-won democratic gains.\" \"The world should speak with one voice in calling for an end to violence in Lebanon intended to subvert democratic processes in that country,\" Rice said. \"Lebanese elections, scheduled to begin in just days, must proceed, in accordance with the Constitution, without threats of foreign interference and the violence that accompanies such obstruction.\" E-mail to a friend .", "6a0a6f44de4059e1d7ef83841b3fd5e95e278ba2": "ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Police made a string of arrests across Europe Tuesday, detaining 20 people suspected of involvement in the recruitment of suicide bombers, Italian police said. Eleven of the arrests were in Italy, in the northern cities of Milan, Reggio Emilia, Bergamo, and San Remo, said. Lt. Col. Sandro Sandulli, the head of the Carabinieri special forces. One was already in custody, so authorities served him with a new arrest warrant which included new charges against him, Sandulli said. Three arrests were in Britain, one in France, and one in Portugal, Sandulli said. The remaining arrests happened in European countries but Sandulli did not specify which ones. Those arrested are suspected of forming Salafi Jihad terrorist cells which were recruiting suicide bombers and sending them to Iraq and Afghanistan, said Col. Mario Parente, deputy commander of the Carabinieri special forces unit. Parente said that during the arrests, police found al Qaeda manuals for the production of explosives, detonation devices, and various poisons. He said the manuals also included details of guerrilla-style war operations. Salafi is an extreme school of Islamic thought which developed in Egypt and began to have prominence with militant groups there in the late 1960s and has since been adopted by terrorist groups in North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe, said Sajjan Gohel, director of international security at the Asia Pacific Foundation in London. \"It's become the ideology of choice for transnational terrorism, including al Qaeda,\" Gohel said. \"It's emerging as a very dangerous ideology.\" The Madrid train bombers and various terrorist cells in Italy were part of the Salafi school of thought, he added. Italian police said Tuesday's arrests were the result of an investigation, started in 2003, into some Salafi cells which were organized by Tunisians and Algerians. The main suspect in the operation is a Tunisian who was arrested in 2002 during a separate antiterrorism operation, police said. The main terrorist cell was based in the northern Italian region of Lombardy and involved what investigators called a \"long-term\" jihadist program which provided military and ideological training. Another cell, based in Reggio Emilia, had the goal of creating a grand Islamic \"empire\" stretching from Morocco to China, police said. Parente said those arrested are also accused of producing false documents, facilitating illegal immigration, and covering up other individuals wanted for terrorism-related crimes.

CNN spoke to the director of \"Monsoon Wedding\" and \"Salaam Bombay!\" at the Bollywood Movie Awards in Long Island about filmmaking in India and America and her adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiri's novel about loss and family, \"The Namesake.\" ............................... Film director Mira Nair . CNN: What inspired you to make \"The Namesake\"? Mira Nair: I happened to read \"The Namesake\" on a plane in early 2004, when I traveled from New York to Jo'berg to finish the filming of \"Vanity Fair.\" I read \"Namesake\" while in huge grief with the death of a beloved person to me [Mira's mother in law]. It was at that state of mourning that I picked up this novel, and in it Jhumpa writes really acutely of a loss of a parent in a foreign country, and I thought I had been understood by someone. It was also a story that linked the two cities in which I had grown up -- Calcutta and New York City -- and it was almost certainly the road that I had traveled. It just spoke to me and I felt compelled to do this film. A few months later we were shooting it. CNN: It's filmed in both India and New York, such different cultures. Tell us about the universal themes involved during the film. Nair: Well, the story of movement and crossings is as old as the hills. It's a tale of millions of us that have left one home for another, and tried to find out who we are through these places. Then when we have children, life gets more interesting. It is about growing up through our adult lives and our children's lives. It is also equally a love story between two people who come from a culture who don't send roses and diamonds for love; who sit at a kitchen table and look at each other. It's about that generation of parents who have that stillness about one another, versus the clang and hustle of young Gogol who is 15 and grows up in an American world because he wishes to be American. That flow -- that see-saw between parents and children, that's what \"The Namesake\" is about. CNN: Tell us about casting the role of Gogol. Nair: Well, Kal Penn plays Gogol and he's known as a comic star, but I had no idea that he existed until my 15-year-old son said, \"This has to be your Gogol.\" I didn't take him seriously at all until every night the campaign mounted at home: \"Tell me in the morning it's Kal Penn!\" he would say. And then Kal wrote to me and told me he became an actor because he had seen \"Mississippi Masala\" when he was eight years old and realized people on the screen could look like him, and other such seductive things. He came to my office and auditioned and he was just so appealing, and so much the real thing, that I cast him as Gogol. CNN: How have Indian audiences reacted to your heavily western-influenced films? Nair: It's not that different a kind of audience, that's what pleases me. \"Salaam Bombay!\" we really made for the children on the streets and the kids who really love that Bollywood stuff, and also with \"Deeply Alternative,\" which ran for 27 weeks. \"Monsoon Wedding\" was also a big hit in India. But no, they don't come to my films for Bollywood fare; it's a completely alternative thing. In terms of audiences on both sides, I've been blessed: the films have been really well received and highly anticipated. CNN: \"The Namesake\" was filmed in America and India.

Nair: In India it is more about orchestrating chaos, and it's about sifting the chaos, but I get especially excited about the throb and chaos on the streets and so on, and in America it's about paying for the chaos, you know every head has to be placed there and paid for. CNN: \"The Namesake\" is about not losing the identity of Indian culture. Was that a challenge? Nair: I am at home in many cultures. I live actively in three continents and I've done that for most of my life, so I just make films as I see the world, and that happens to speak to people. I do things that I want to do. It so happens because I am fluent in both worlds that my films enter both worlds, perhaps. CNN: Do Indian and American audiences behave differently? Nair: No, not really. I think films have to reach people and really grab them. That's what I hope to do when I make a film -- to get under your skin and really make you think about something, and have a transporting time that takes you somewhere.

A grand jury identified Eric Rivera Jr. as the shooter in the death of NFL star Sean Taylor. Court documents say the youngest is alleged to have fired the fatal shot. The three adult suspects -- Venjah K. Hunte, 20, Jason Scott Mitchell, 19, and Charles Kendrick Lee Wardlow, 18 -- appeared in court Tuesday via videoconference wearing thick green vests, which defense attorneys said were suicide safety smocks. They were ordered held without bail at the Pre-Trial Detention Center in Miami, Florida, where Corrections Officer Janelle Hall said they are under suicide watch. The fourth suspect -- Eric Rivera Jr., 17 -- remained in custody in Fort Myers, Florida. His attorney, Wilbur Smith, told CNN he expected his client to be moved to a Miami-Dade juvenile detention facility Wednesday.  Watch CNN's Rick Sanchez speak to attorneys for two of the suspects \u00bb . Rivera was armed during the alleged burglary, and \"during the course of the commission of the offense ... discharged a firearm and as a result of the discharge, death or great bodily harm was inflicted upon Sean Maurice Taylor, a human being,\" the indictment says. The four men were arrested Friday, officials said. Taylor, 24, died a day after he was shot during an apparent burglary at his home. Miami-Dade police investigators said they believe the burglars thought the house was empty. Thousands of mourners attended Taylor's funeral Monday at Florida International University's arena.  See photos from the funeral \u00bb . Police said Taylor and his girlfriend, Jackie Garcia, were awakened by noise coming from the living room early November 26. Taylor got up and locked the bedroom door, but the door was kicked in and two shots were fired, police said. One struck Taylor in the leg. Garcia and the couple's 18-month-old daughter were not hurt. Authorities have said Garcia told police she was hiding under the bedding during the attack, did not see what happened and could not provide a suspect description. A break-in had been reported at Taylor's residence eight days earlier. A police report from that incident said someone forced a window open and left a kitchen knife on a bed. Several drawers and a bedroom safe were searched during the break-in, according to the report. Taylor spent four years with the Redskins, earning his first Pro Bowl selection in 2006. He suffered a sprained right knee in a November 11 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles and had not played since. The 2004 first-round draft pick played at the University of Miami, where he was an All-American in 2003. He was regarded as one of the hardest-hitting players in the NFL. E-mail to a friend .

Michael Mazza, 40, was arrested outside a pawn shop in Hollywood, Florida, hours after the death of Broward County Deputy Paul Rein sparked a massive manhunt. It was the third shooting of a Broward County sheriff's deputy in four months, and the second fatality. The incident happened as Mazza was being taken to the second day of his trial in connection with the armed robbery of a Coral Springs bank, Sheriff Al Lamberti said. Mazza was being transported in a medical van because of a medical condition, Lamberti said. The driver's compartment of the van was separated from the back by a cage or grill. Mazza and Rein left about 8:05 a.m., Lamberti said. Minutes later, a truck driver who saw all or part of the altercation near Pompano Beach called 911. \"All of this transpired within six minutes. That's all it took,\" Lamberti said. The struggle began when Rein apparently pulled the medical transport van over at an intersection. The deputy's body showed other injuries from the fight -- a broken finger, bruises and cuts, Lamberti said. Mazza allegedly took Rein's service weapon away from him and shot him, authorities said. Although two shots were fired, Rein was shot only once, the bullet entering his upper chest and exiting his lower back, Lamberti told reporters. After the shooting, Mazza is believed to have thrown Rein from the van and driven away. A city public works employee later spotted the blood-spattered van in Fort Lauderdale, Lamberti said. Mazza, meanwhile, is believed to have hitchhiked his way down to Hollywood, about 20 miles away. He approached a man at a pawn shop and asked for a ride. The man, who was headed to a second pawn shop, agreed. When the man arrived at the second pawn shop, he left Mazza in the car and went inside, Lamberti said. As he was talking to the clerk, a television in the shop began broadcasting news about the deputy's shooting, and showed a picture of Mazza, he said. The man \"tells the clerk, 'Hey, I have that guy in my car,' \" Lamberti said. He went back to the car, took his keys, came back and told the clerk to call police. Mazza was arrested shortly afterward. Rein's gun was found with Mazza in the man's car, the sheriff said. Mazza faces charges including first-degree murder and escape, Lamberti said. He was being interviewed by police Wednesday afternoon and was to appear before a judge at some point, he said, and afterward would be transported to Dade County Jail. Because the shooting was \"an emotionally charged event for all of us ... we feel it's probably better that he be housed at another facility outside of Broward County,\" Lamberti said, and Dade County agreed to house him. Mazza initially was reluctant to talk to authorities, but later agreed, and confessed to shooting Rein, the sheriff said. He offered no details. Lamberti said Mazza was serving a life sentence for robbing a drugstore in Coconut Creek, correcting his earlier statement that Mazza was serving two life sentences. He was on trial for robbery of the Coral Springs bank. Broward County also has a pending case against Mazza -- a February drugstore robbery in Pompano Beach, he said. Mazza was dressed in civilian clothes -- a suit -- rather than jail scrubs Wednesday because he had a court date, authorities have said. When caught, however, Mazza was wearing a T-shirt, shorts and sneakers, Lamberti told reporters. Police are investigating whether he had planned the escape in advance and whether anyone helped him. Rein's co-workers told reporters he was \"in outstanding condition physically.\" The sheriff's office has fitness-for-duty standards that deputies must meet. Broward County deputies conduct some 400 to 500 inmate court transports a day -- one deputy transporting up to a handful of inmates, Lamberti said. Thin staffing and scant resources prevent more than one deputy being involved, he said. \"It's a routine thing,\" Lamberti said. \"But it shows, in this profession, nothing is routine, whether it be a domestic, a traffic stop or just transporting an inmate to court.\" As news of the escape broke, all 273 schools in Broward County went on lockdown, according to Nadine Drew, a spokeswoman for the school system. Lamberti said Rein's wife spoke to her husband by cell phone just 10 minutes before he was shot. \"She said you never think it's going to happen to you,\" the sheriff said. The deputy was memorialized Wednesday on the Web site of the Broward County Sheriff's Office. Visitors to the site were greeted by a photo of Rein, with a caption saying, \"Husband. Father.

A worker checks oil cleanup gear near the Golden Gate Bridge Thursday in San Francisco, California. The U.S. attorney in San Francisco has opened a federal criminal investigation into Wednesday's crash of the MV Cosco Busan to determine whether the captain and crew violated federal maritime laws. Although not officially detained, the captain and crew were barred by law from leaving the vessel, which is docked for repairs in Oakland, the Coast Guard said. \"You had a competently manned ship with a pilot, all the navigation and sensors,\" said Adm. Thad Allen, Coast Guard commandant. There were \"probably some human error factors, but we need to determine the facts, because there's no reason a ship like that should have collided with the bridge.\"  Watch Allen on the criminal probe \u00bb . The Cosco Busan was departing Oakland for South Korea when it struck a tower supporting the western suspension span of the Bay Bridge, cutting a 212-foot, 12-foot wide gash in the ship's side. About 58,000 gallons of heavy-duty bunker oil poured out of the vessel as it was moored near Treasure Island.  See where oil spilled \u00bb . The oil sickened birds and formed globules on more than 20 of the area's beaches. It oozed along the San Francisco city waterfront and out of the bay, beneath the Golden Gate Bridge toward Marin County. Allen defended the Coast Guard against criticism of its response to the spill. Some lawmakers, including one of the state's U.S. senators, Democrat Barbara Boxer, have criticized the Coast Guard's handling of the collision and resulting spill. Boxer said the Coast Guard initially reported that the ship's owner had said only 140 gallons had spilled from the Cosco Busan. Boxer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California have called for congressional hearings into the accident and resulting spill. Although Allen conceded some confusion in the Coast Guard's communication, he said it did not reflect their response. \"Response was set into play within an hour of the event itself,\" Allen said Monday. Regarding the initial low estimate of 140 gallons of lost oil, Allen said heavy fog and damage to the ship's tanks hindered initial aerial and on-ground evaluations of how much oil had leaked from the ship. In addition to federal prosecutors, the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the accident, and NTSB spokeswoman Debbie Hersman said Sunday that agency was interviewing the pilot, the ship's crew, and other pilots who were on the water at the time of Wednesday's crash.  See photos of oil coating the bay \u00bb . The crew had been on its inaugural voyage on the ship, which the current owner purchased last month, Hersman said. The NTSB also intends to review the ship's voyage data recorder, which should have recorded captain and crew conversations on the bridge and other information in the 12 hours leading up to the bridge collision, Hersman said. The oil spill has sparked concern among local officials and environmentalists. As of Sunday, 23 beaches in the area remained closed. Angel Island State Park, the Bay's largest island, reopened Monday, the Coast Guard said. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has declared a state of emergency, freeing money to clean up the spill. Seven miles of containment boom stretched across the bay has collected more than 12,271 gallons of oil so far, and another 4,000 gallons have evaporated, officials said. Nearly 400 dead birds have been recovered from the bay, while another 500 birds have been rescued alive but soaked in oil, according to Lisa Curtis, administrator of the Department of Fish and Games Office of Spill Prevention and Response. In 1989, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground and fouled Alaska's Prince William Sound with almost 11 million gallons of crude -- the nation's worst ever oil spill. Thousands of birds and animals died in the disaster, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Often birds and animals are threatened when they come in contact with the oil and swallow it as they try to clean themselves, said the NOAA Web site. In addition to birds, oil spills can be very harmful to fish and shellfish,  NOAA said. Twenty wildlife teams were scheduled Monday to be the bay, working to find sick birds so they can be rehabilitated, Curtis said. On Sunday, the state's other U.S. senator and a leading Coast Guard official decried the accident. \"This an incident which, in my view, should not have happened,\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said Sunday after being briefed by Coast Guard officials. Rear Adm. Craig E. Bone, the Coast Guard's director of inspection and compliance, echoed Feinstein's comments. \"This incident should have never ever occurred,\" he said. \"There's systems, there's capabilities, there's licensed operators, there's a pilot on board the vessel, there's the capacity and the capability to safely navigate through this port and waterways every day.\" He added, \"But we have to move beyond the incident and the fact that it occurred and move forward into the response.\" The California Department of Transportation said the collision did no structural damage to the bridge and there was no interruption of bridge traffic -- more than 250,000 vehicles daily.

Almost 30 Josephs and Marys had already signed up for the free night's stay at the Travelodge, said Shakila Ahmed, a spokeswoman for the hotel chain. \"The 'gift' of a free night's stay is to make up for the hotel industry not having any rooms left on Christmas Eve over 2000 years ago when the original 'Mary and Joseph' had to settle for the night in a stable,\" the company says on its Web site.

However, it's not where most people might expect. Journalist Eric Weiner says he wanted to explore the relationship between place and happiness. Just ask Eric Weiner, who made it his mission to find the most content places around the globe, uncovering lots of surprises along the way. Hungering for a tropical paradise? A warm climate doesn't necessarily make a happy nation, Weiner said. Thinking of moving to a wealthy state? Money can degrade happiness, he found. Weiner, who wrote the book, \"The Geography of Bliss: One Grump's Search for the Happiest Places in the World,\" began his quest for very personal reasons. \"I'm an unhappy person, so it's kind of what prompts a hungry person to search for food,\" he said. Weiner spent 10 years as a foreign correspondent for National Public Radio, a job that took him to some of the least happy places in the world. It was enough to send him on a yearlong journey to look for just the opposite. Weiner mapped out his quest with a combination of scientific and personal methods, choosing some countries because they traditionally score high on happiness surveys and selecting others to see how factors like money play a role. A world map of happiness, based on 100 different studies and produced by Britain's University of Leicester in 2006, listed Denmark as the world's happiest nation. But for Weiner, the place where he felt the most bliss was a toss-up between Bhutan and Iceland, countries that ranked eighth and fourth, respectively, on the happiness map. Weiner's list of favorites also included Thailand, India and Switzerland.  See photos of his favorites and listen to him explain why they're happy \u00bb . His top two picks, though very different countries, have unconventional paths to happiness, he said. \"Bhutan is probably the closest thing on Earth to Shangri-La, that fictional paradise,\" Weiner explained. He pointed out that while other countries focus on their gross domestic product, the Himalayan kingdom proudly touts its policy of \"gross national happiness.\" \"The Bhutanese very much believe that happiness should be part and parcel of every government decision,\" Weiner said. Cold place, warm relationships . Thousands of miles away, Weiner found happiness in a very different environment, marveling at the creativity and \"coziness\" of Iceland. \"Everyone in Iceland is a poet,\" Weiner recalled. He visited the country during winter and said he found a certain beauty in the  cold and the darkness. Such a chilly climate usually encourages warm relationships, Weiner found. \"The cold inspires people to cooperate, traditionally. If you go back a few hundred years, people in cold climates have to cooperate or they die together. It's that simple,\" he said. Weiner found a different flavor of happiness in Switzerland, where he discovered people are content partly because everything runs like clockwork. Simple pleasures like trains arriving on time contributed to national happiness, he said. But there may be a much sweeter reason why Switzerland is a happy place. \"The Swiss eat a lot of chocolate, and let's not forget that,\" Weiner said. He was also impressed with how the Swiss view money. \"Their attitude is that if you've got it, hide it. While our attitude is if you've got it, flaunt it,\" Weiner said, comparing the Swiss to Americans. Weiner called the United States, which came in at No. 23 on the University of Leicester's world map of happiness, a nation that \"is not as happy as it is wealthy.\" The impact of wealth and taxes . The relationship between money and happiness took Weiner to the Middle East and Qatar, a country with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, thanks to oil and natural gas revenues, according to the CIA World Factbook. \"I went there specifically to examine what happens when the entire country wins the lottery,\" Weiner said. He found the wealth made the residents comfortable, but also degraded their level of contentment. \"Most of our happiness is derived from our relationships with other people,\" Weiner said. \"The money in Qatar has allowed them to wall themselves off, literally and figuratively, from other people. ... That's not a recipe for happiness.\" There are no income taxes in Qatar, but that's not a cause for contentment, Weiner found. Some taxation is necessary for happiness because it's a way of being invested in a place, he argued. \"You're giving money to someone else, a government, and you're trusting them to do something good with it,\" Weiner said. \"In a country where there's no taxation at all, people don't have vested interests in how well the government performs. You can't say, 'Hey, those are my tax dollars at work.'\" Quest creates buzz . Weiner's book has struck a chord, recently rising to the top 10 of The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list. An expert who studies happiness said part of the book's appeal may lie in how Weiner mapped out his journey. \"He arranges an interesting itinerary because he uses science as his compass,\" said Daniel Gilbert, a psychology professor at Harvard University and the author of \"Stumbling on Happiness.\" Gilbert said it's only recently that a combination of biology, sociology and psychology has been able to answer the \"where's and why's\" of happiness, a subject that has always fascinated people. \"The quest for happiness is the central preoccupation of human beings and has been for as long as there have been human beings,\" Gilbert said. He echoed Weiner's findings that bliss is other people. \"Everyone has been telling us for the longest time that happiness is about social relationships, well, bingo, they're right,\" Gilbert said. Meanwhile, after a year of exploring some of the world's happiest places, Weiner -- the self-described \"grump\" -- said his mind-set has improved somewhat. \"I would describe myself as a recovering grump,\" Weiner said. \"At this point, I think I am marginally happier than before I started the project.\" E-mail to a friend .", "e3f24714630bd679c4b4fdb77e90f785beb1ff33": "(CNN) -- A Saudi Arabian human rights attorney is asking the government to allow him to represent a woman who was gang-raped -- and then sentenced to prison for speaking out about the case. Human rights groups want Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah to drop charges against the rape victim. The attorney, Abdulrahman al-Lahim, had his license revoked last week by a judge for speaking to the Saudi-controlled media about the case, al-Lahim told CNN. The judge more than doubled the sentence against al-Lahim's 19-year-old client because she spoke to the media about the case, a court source told Arab News, an English-language Middle Eastern daily newspaper. The woman -- who was initially sentenced in October 2006 to 90 lashes -- had her sentenced increased to 200 lashes and was ordered to serve six months in prison under Saudi Arabia's strict Islamic law. \"We were shocked,\" al-Lahim said of the increased sentence. CNN has been unable to reach Saudi government officials for comment on this report, despite repeated requests.  Watch the emotional toll the crime took on the rape victim \u00bb . Al-Lahim had petitioned the court to sentence the attackers to the death penalty, but instead the court agreed to increase their jail sentences, which had been two to three years, to two to nine years, al-Lahim said. The case has sparked outrage among human rights groups. \"Barring the lawyer from representing the victim in court is almost equivalent to the rape crime itself,\" said Fawzeyah al-Oyouni, founding member of the newly formed Saudi Association for the Defense of Women's Rights. \"This is not just about the girl, it's about every woman in Saudi Arabia,\" she said. \"We're fearing for our lives and the lives of our sisters and our daughters and every Saudi woman out there. We're afraid of going out in the streets.\" Human Rights Watch said it has called on Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah \"to immediely void the verdict and drop all charges against the rape victim and to order the court to end its harassment of her lawyer.\" The woman, who is married, and an unrelated man were abducted and she was raped by a group of seven men more than a year ago, the lawyer said. The male victim was also given an increased sentence of 200 lashes and six months in prison, al-Lahim said. The man and woman were attacked after they met so she could retrieve an old photograph of herself from him, according to al-Lahim. Citing phone records from the police investigation, al-Lahim said the man was trying to blackmail his client. He noted the photo she was trying to retrieve was harmless and did not show his client in any compromising position. Al-Lahim said the man tried to blame his client for insisting on meeting him that day. It is illegal for a woman to meet with an unrelated male under Saudi's Islamic law. Al-Lahim has been ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Justice next month, where he faces a possible three-year suspension and disbarment, according to Human Rights Watch. He told CNN he has appealed to the Ministry of Justice to reinstate his law license and plans to meet with Justice Minister Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim Al Al-Sheikh. \"Currently she doesn't have a lawyer, and I feel they're doing this to isolate her and deprive her from her basic rights,\" he said. \"We will not accept this judgment and I'll do my best to continue representing her because justice needs to take place.\" He said the handling of the case is a direct contradiction of judicial reforms announced by the Saudi king earlier this month. \"The Ministry of Justice needs to have a very clear standing regarding this case because I consider this decision to be judiciary mutiny against the reform that King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz started and against Saudi women who are being victimized because of such decisions,\" he said. Saudi Arabia's Islamic law or sharia is not written and, therefore, subject to a wide array of interpretations. Human Rights Watch points out that a judge in Jeddah threw out a lawyer simply because he was a member of the Ismaili faith, a branch of Shia Islam. Under Saudi law, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or have surgery. Women are also not allowed to testify in court unless it is about a private matter that was not observed by a man, and they are not allowed to vote. The Saudi government recently has taken some steps toward bettering the situation of women in the kingdom, including the establishment earlier this year of special courts to handle domestic abuse cases, adoption of a new labor law that addresses working women's rights and creation of a human rights commission. Christoph Wilcke of Human Rights Watch praised the female rape victim and her attorney for speaking out about the case, which he said may be indicative of \"many injustices that we still don't know about.\" \"It's not only one court, it is the Saudi government that is fully behind punishing a woman who's been raped [and] punishing the lawyer who's trying to help her and doing that both because they've spoken to the media,\" Wilcke told CNN. \"And if they hadn't spoken to the media, we wouldn't know about it.\" Shying away from criticism of key ally, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack called the case and the punishment \"surprising\" and \"astonishing.\" \"While this is a judicial procedure -- part of a judicial procedure -- overseas in courts outside of our country, still while it is very difficult to offer any detailed comment about this situation, I think most people would be quite astonished by the situation, \" McCormack said. \"I can't get involved in specific court cases in Saudi Arabia dealing with its own citizens. But most people here would be quite surprised to learn of the circumstances and then the punishment meted out,\" he said. E-mail to a friend .

The 19-year-old gunman sent at least one text message to his former girlfriend, with whom he broke up about two weeks ago, Omaha Police Chief Thomas Warren said. Robert Hawkins also left a voice mail for his mother before killing eight people at a department store Wednesday. He chose his victims randomly, police believe, then took his own life. Hawkins visited a friend near the Westroads Mall before the shootings and apparently went directly to the shopping center after that meeting, Warren said.

Police haven't finished tracing the gun, but believe Hawkins stole it from his stepfather's home. Security officers flagged Hawkins as suspicious when he entered the mall. He left soon after he entered, then returned less than six minutes later with something apparently hidden in a balled-up sweatshirt. He went up an elevator to the mall's third floor, then immediately began firing, ultimately turning the firearm on himself, Warren said. \"It doesn't appear as though there was an opportunity for intervention,\" Warren said. Hawkins fired more than 30 rounds, the police chief said. The shootings sent panicked holiday shoppers fleeing for cover. \"It was just so loud, and then it was silence,\" said witness Jennifer Kramer, who hid inside a circular clothing rack. \"I was scared to death he'd be walking around looking for someone else.\"  Watch how Kramer and her mother hid \u00bb .

Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman said Hawkins had been a ward of the state for nearly four years, but he did not specify in what capacity. The state's custody ended in August of last year, Heineman said. U.S. Army recruiters turned Hawkins down last summer when he tried to enlist, a source familiar with the situation said Thursday. The source didn't want to be named because it is against the military's rules to discuss potential recruits. The reason for his rejection was unclear. Heineman ordered that flags throughout the state be lowered to half-staff through Sunday. The dead include six store employees and two customers, ranging in age from 24 to 66.

The flight was aggravated by the February 2006 bombing of a Shiite shrine in Samarra, an attack that stoked pitched sectarian warfare.

Jolie is talking with U.S. officials, including top U.S. Gen. David Petraeus, about that issue, and are willing to provide such security which she said \"needs to be addressed and solved.\" The Iraqi government needs to empower agencies that deal with migration to address the concerns of the displaced -- but that has not happened yet, she said. Jolie said it was crucial that the government prepare a plan to deal with refugees who return home from Syria and Jordan and find that their homes are \"occupied\" by others or \"bombed out.\" She emphasizes the way in which these people are resettled will have \"broad implications\" in the region. Jolie also is talking to people about moving forward the U.S. effort to resettle Iraqi refugees in the United States, which has set a goal of taking in 12,000 of those people by September. Only 375 have been admitted so far. \"I have to believe there are people working toward that goal,\" she said. International agencies, such as the United Nations and the Arab League, and many countries in the region and in Europe are addressing the refugee and the internally displaced persons' crisis, and money is being allocated to Iraq and host countries to help clothe, feed and house people. Most of the refugees are in Syria and Jordan, and they reside in big cities like Damascus and Amman. The U.N.C.H.R. is trying to help governments in Syria and Jordan to cope with the influx, which has stretched the resources of institutions like schools and health systems. It is also attempting to help 41,000 non-Iraqi refugees in Iraq, such as Palestinians and Iranians. Last month, the UNHCR announced a plan to seek $261 million this year for its work to help these refugees. It has almost 350 staffers \"directly engaged in operations for Iraq and the surrounding region.\" Officials in Iraq and the coalition have been heartened by the fact that some refugees are starting to trickle back home. But they are returning to a country where mixed Shiite and Sunni neighborhoods have turned into Sunni or Shiite enclaves and that they might not be able to return to their homes.

Ezequiel Lavezzi inspired Napoli to victory against Udinese, netting twice and setting up the first goal. Ezequiel Lavezzi scored twice in two minutes to end a goal drought lasting two and a half months, netting on 74 and 75 as Napoli moved up to ninth in the table. The Argentine also provided the cross that Udinese defender Cristian Zapata put into his own net to leave the visitors playing catch-up from just the third minute. Pepe leveled the score on nine minutes, and then Napoli played with 10 men from the 36th minute after Paolo Cannavaro was expelled for a last-man foul. But the teams were even in numbers again after Pepe was ejected for a second yellow card on 60 minutes. Udinese are still four points behind fourth-placed Fiorentina and the last Champions League berth. Fiorentina hosts AC Milan, which has 30 points, on Sunday. In Saturday's other match, Fabrizio Miccoli scored the only goal to give Palermo a 1-0 victory over Livorno. Miccoli struck in the 76th minute with a shot from just outside the area with Livorno goalkeeper Marco Amelia partially unsighted by several players. Palermo keeper Alberto Fontana saved a penalty by Francesco Tavano at the end of the first half, and had to make several vital stops in the first opening period. Palermo had lost their last three Serie A matches and dropped down the table, but the win put them one point above Napoli in eighth. In Sunday's other matches, leaders Inter Milan host second-bottom Empoli and second-placed Roma travel to third-bottom Siena.

As many as 28 in every 1,000 passengers do not arrive at their destination at the same time as their luggage. The trial -- run by BAA and airline Emirates -- is using RFID (radio-frequency identification) technology to tag baggage. This will allow staff to more accurately track bags passing through the airport. The crucial difference between RFID and the existing barcode system is its scanning accuracy. Barcode tags can be easily damaged in transit and are also at risk of being covered when scanned. If not scanned, details must be entered manually into the system, adding time and error to the process. BAA estimates that Heathrow can read only 60 per cent of labels that pass through. RFID is reported to offer over 99 percent accuracy. The \u00a3150,000 trial -- the first of its kind in the UK -- will continue for six months tracking bags for passengers traveling with Emirates to and from Dubai, and transferring through Heathrow. A duplicate of the Heathrow system has been installed at Dubai Airport. During the check-in process at Heathrow Terminal 3, staff apply tags containing RFID chips to bags with information including the passenger's name and route. The chips are then read on entry into the baggage system; they are tracked as they move throughout; and finally on leaving the system. As a result, says Shaun Cowlam, Logistics Director at Heathrow Airport, staff can know where a bag is at \"every moment of every day\". BAA is also considering introducing a SMS text messaging service to keep passengers informed of where their bags are. When passengers arrive at Heathrow, says Cowlam, the idea will be to send passengers a text informing them what belt and what time their bags will arrive at. Ultimately, the use of RFID could extend services to frequent flyers, and provide the means to added value services such as faster check-in, and even be integrated with secure collection and delivery. The main benefits, however, will be for travelers passing through major hubs such as Heathrow and Dubai, as this system offers better processing of baggage on transfer flights. Emirates and BAA are sharing the costs of the trial. But as Vic Sheppard, Emirates Vice President for UK and Ireland says, \"cost is not an issue\", especially considering the savings the airline is expected to achieve by reducing loss and repatriation of bags. And as Cowlam adds: \"if we can introduce this across the whole network the costs will reduce significantly.\" Hong Kong International Airport was one of the first to deploy RFID technology in 2005. But as outlined in a recent survey by SITA, RFID is being used in just 6 percent of the airports surveyed. \"For this system to really take off we need other airports and other airlines to embrace the technology,\" says Cowlam. That widespread adoption may not be far off. The SITA survey indicated that RFID tags will be used in 45 percent of airports by the end of 2009. It's still early days, but BAA and Emirates are optimistic for RFID's future in airports. \"There have been giant strides in the technology in aviation in recent years. But in the last few decades there hasn't been any advancement in the methods adopted for baggage handling,\" says Sheppard. \"This is a major step forward.\" E-mail to a friend .", "521fc18da417d441ba600a4abdbf279bb0c8f69d": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Jordan's King Hussein sent a secret message to President Richard Nixon in 1970 pleading with him to attack Syria, according to declassified documents released Wednesday by the former president's library. President Nixon works at his desk in the Oval Office in a June 1972 photograph. The papers are among about 10,000 documents released by the Nixon Presidential Library, some of which offer harbingers of present-day events, such as concerns about terrorism and Saudi Arabia. Library director Timothy Naftali said the documents describe challenges such as how to get the Saudis more involved in solving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, how to get them more engaged against terrorism, how to address the Arab view that the United States always sides with Israel and how to build up moderate Palestinians to counter extremists. A 1973 diplomatic cable cites this objective: \"isolate and undermine terrorisms [sic] and commandos [sic] by establishing another, more stable and respectable Palestinian political entity and political personality.\" Documents detail U.S. efforts to persuade Saudi Arabia to move away from Fatah, the military wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization, because U.S. officials believed the PLO was supporting the terrorist-linked, anti-Israel group Black September, referred to as BSO. The document, a U.S. State Department telegram from the embassy in Jeddah to Washington reads, \"BSO and Fatah [are] now linked together in vicious effort to create chaos and uncertainty. One might wonder whether central objective BSO conspiracy was not to erase any slight progress toward Middle East peace.\" The document release was intended to coincide with Mideast peace summit among Palestinian, Israeli and other Mideast leaders in Maryland, Naftali said. The Nixon White House also was adjusting to Israel's acquisition of a nuclear weapon. \"We are declassifying the records today that laid the basis for Richard Nixon's decision in 1969 to accept the fact, a fact of life, that Israel had a bomb, a nuclear device,\" said Naftali. \"That, of course, is very important with what's going on in Annapolis.\" \"Even though it is clear from the documents that the United States government did not encourage Israel to acquire a nuclear deterrent, it became a fact of life,\" Naftali said. \"There are materials here that show how our government, 30 years ago, dealt with this very, very difficult problem.\" Rather than openly declare itself as a nuclear power, Israel still maintains a strategic ambiguity over its nuclear weapons capability. In 1970, as King Hussein dealt with threats by both Palestinian refugees in his country and Syrian military forces crossing Jordan's border, the king asked \"the United States and Great Britain to intervene in the war in Jordan, asking the United States, in fact, to attack Syria,\" Naftali said. \"Syria had invaded Jordan and the Jordanian king, facing what he felt was a military rout, said please help us in any way possible.\" The telegram indicates that Hussein himself called a U.S. official at 3 a.m. to ask for American or British help. \"Situation deteriorating dangerously following Syrian massive invasion...,\" the document said. \"I request immediate physical intervention both land and air ... to safeguard sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Jordan. Immediate air strikes on invading forces from any quarter plus air cover are imperative.\" The library has withheld the Nixon documents from public access until Wednesday and have been reviewed for release and/or declassified, Naftali said. Nixon served as president from January 20, 1969, to August 9, 1974, when he resigned under political pressure during the Watergate scandal -- the only U.S. president to do so. He died in 1994 after suffering a stroke at the age of 81. E-mail to a friend .", "48fd5553806beaaa508596b0c8267a1ee703a8fe": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The Rev. James Orange, a civil rights activist whose 1965 jailing sparked a fatal protest that ultimately led to the famed Selma-to-Montgomery march and the Voting Rights Act, died Saturday at Atlanta's Crawford Long Hospital, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference said in a statement. He was 65. Orange was a native of Birmingham, Alabama, \"who resided in southwest Atlanta for four decades while fighting the good fight for equality and social justice for all mankind,\" said the SCLC, a civil rights organization. Orange was arrested and jailed in Perry County, Alabama, in 1965 on charges of disorderly conduct and contributing to the delinquency of minors for enlisting students to aid in voting rights drives. As rumors spread that Orange would be lynched, civil rights activists organized a march to support him. However, the marchers clashed with Alabama state troopers during the February 18 demonstration, and a young black man, Jimmie Lee Jackson, was shot in the stomach. \"I could hear the singing and the commotion,\" Orange told CNN last year. \"Once the tear gas was flying and the shots started, I couldn't tell what was going on.\" Jackson, 26, died eight days later. Witnesses said Jackson's grandfather, who was active in the voting rights movement, had been beaten by troopers, and Jackson was trying to get him to the hospital. The anger resulting from Jackson's death led civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., to organize the Selma-to-Montgomery, Alabama, voting rights march. The first attempt at that march was broken up by club-wielding state troopers and sheriff's deputies, a melee that became known as \"Bloody Sunday.\" \"Jimmie's death is the reason that Bloody Sunday took place,\" Orange said. \"Had he not died, there would never have been a Bloody Sunday.\" On the marchers' third attempt, in March, they made it to Montgomery. President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law in August 1965. In May 2007, a former Alabama state trooper, James B. Fowler, now 74, was indicted in Jackson's shooting, one of several cases involving the deaths of civil rights activists that prosecutors have revived in recent years. Fowler has claimed he shot Jackson in self-defense, but Orange and Elijah Rollins, who was upstairs at a nearby cafe when the shooting took place, last year disputed claims that protesters were throwing rocks and bottles at police. \"Not one bottle or brick was thrown back at the troopers,\" said Orange, adding that film and a Justice Department report back that up. He said he was glad Jackson's case had \"never been forgotten.\" Orange was a project coordinator at the SCLC from 1965 to 1970, then later became a regional coordinator with the AFL-CIO in Atlanta, the SCLC said. Since 1995, he had served as the founder and general coordinator for the M.L. King Jr. March Committee-Africa/African American Renaissance Committee, Inc., which coordinated commemorative events honoring King and also promoted industry and commerce among Atlanta, the United States and South Africa. Orange is survived by his wife, five children and two grandchildren, the SCLC said. Funeral arrangements were incomplete Saturday.

Lebanese women wait in line to cast their votes in Beirut. Voters in Beirut sent pro-government candidate Mohammed al-Amin Itani to parliament to replace Walid Eido, who was killed in a June bombing. Both Eido, a Sunni Muslim, and Itani are members of the bloc led by Saad Hariri -- the son of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, whose 2005 killing triggered Lebanon's current wave of political upheaval. But in Metn, a Maronite Christian suburb east of the capital, anti-government candidate Camille Khouri upset former President Amin Gemayel by a few hundred votes, Lebanese television network LBC reported. Khouri is a member of the Free Patriotic Movement, the anti-government party led by former Lebanese Army Gen. Michel Aoun. Aoun has said he will run for president of Lebanon -- and since the post is chosen by members of parliament, Sunday's results were closely watched. Gemayel was seeking the seat held by his son Pierre, who served as industry minister in the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora before being gunned down in his car in November 2006. He served as president from 1982 to 1988, during the civil war in Lebanon. His brother, Bashir Gemayel, was elected president in 1982 but was assassinated before he could take office. Eido and Gemayel were among several Lebanese political figures killed since the February 2005 killing of the elder Hariri. All were critical of Syria's influence in Lebanon, and their supporters blamed Damascus for their deaths -- allegations the Syrians and their allies in Lebanon denied. Hariri's killing triggered a wave of protests against Syria known as the \"Cedar Revolution,\" which brought Siniora's government to power and forced Syria to withdraw the garrison it kept in Lebanon for three decades.

Ex-CIA agent John Kiriakou says he underwent waterboarding in training and cracked in a few seconds. Kiriakou spoke last week with several news organizations, including CNN, after the CIA disclosed that videotapes of certain interrogations were destroyed in 2005. That revelation has prompted new calls for investigations on Capitol Hill. The Bush administration appeared in U.S. District Court on Friday to answer a judge's questions about the tapes' destruction. Speaking to CNN last week, Kiriakou said that U.S. interrogators drew valuable information from al Qaeda captive Abu Zubayda by \"waterboarding\" him. But Kiriakou said the procedure amounts to torture and should be stopped. Waterboarding involves pouring a stream of water onto the cellophane-covered face of a suspect to induce the sensation of drowning, Kiriakou said.  Watch how a suspect is waterboarded \u00bb . Kiriakou told CNN he was unaware that CIA interrogations were being taped, but that the tapes should have been kept \"as a matter of historical record.\" Kiriakou's attorney Mark Zaid told CNN that the referral of the case to the Justice Department is standard procedure. \"A criminal referral from the CIA would be both expected and normal under the circumstances,\" Zaid said in a written statement. \"It is a routine act that the CIA undertakes even when they know no violation has occurred.\" Zaid added that the question is whether the Justice Department will proceed, and that such a decision \"must be measured carefully.\" \"Doing so will unlock a Pandora's box that will place a spotlight on the information in question as to the lawfulness of the alleged conduct and the activities of those involved.\" he said. \"There would also exist a challenge regarding whether Mr. Kiriakou was being targeted for exercising his First Amendment rights.\" CIA officers who leave the agency are required to sign documents promising never to divulge classified information. Written comments are cleared by an agency review board before publication, and unscripted oral comments -- such as television interviews -- are referred to the Justice Department after the fact. About one case a week is referred to the Justice Department, and an investigation could take months to complete, a source in the intelligence community said. For private citizens found to be in violation of the secrecy standard, penalties can range from loss of security clearances to criminal prosecution leading to jail time. Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said the department has no comment on the Kiriakou matter, and routinely refuses comment on whether another agency has referred a case. Kiriakou said he was not present when other agents used the waterboarding technique on Abu Zubayda, but that he was told the al Qaeda suspect lasted 30 or 35 seconds. Kiriakou said he himself was subjected to the treatment during his training, and lasted about five seconds before having to stop. E-mail to a friend .

Take Felicia Sullivan, of Brooklyn. Four years ago, she and her live-in boyfriend -- the guy she thought she would marry -- were having a pre-Valentine's Day brunch when Sullivan leaned over and whispered a few sweet nothings in his ear. \"I said, 'I'm so happy to know that you're the one for me. Aren't you glad to know I'm the one for you?' \" says Sullivan, 32, who works in marketing. \"And there was this silence. And then he was, like, 'I know you're the one for me now. But can you give me until summer to make a final decision?' \" Aghast at his response, Sullivan quickly broke things off -- but she couldn't move until she found a new apartment. Home alone on February 14 in the apartment they shared, she decided to snoop through her ex-boyfriend's e-mail and discovered he'd had contact with several other women while they were together. \"I've never been a big fan of the holiday,\" Sullivan says. \"But now I typically refer to it as Black Monday...\"   Watch whether romance is still alive \u00bb . Good times, bad times . Sullivan isn't alone in dreading Valentine's Day. Thanks to super-sized expectations and over-the-top commercialization, February 14 has gone from a sentimental aside to a pressure-filled gauntlet lined with chocolate boxes, tennis bracelets and cheesy stuffed bears.  See where the love dollars go \u00bb . \"The holiday's designed to make you feel (bad),\" says Judy McGuire, author of \"How Not to Date.\" \"If you're in a relationship, it's never anything that it's supposed to be. And if you're single, you feel like a big loser because you don't have anybody. I think people should lower Valentine's Day expectations to pretty much nil. That way, anything that happens is good.\" Brian Wise, a 32-year-old technical writer from Seattle has seen his Valentine's Day go sideways repeatedly -- most memorably the time he ended up in handcuffs (and not in a good way). \"Last year, I was in Singapore and I met this beautiful woman who took me to dinner at this hot, new restaurant,'\" he says. \"But then she gets food poisoning and ends up in an alley with major gastrointestinal problems. And while I'm standing guard, the cops pull up and think I'm paying her for sex.\" Wise talked his way out of an arrest (luckily, one of the policemen had eaten at the same place) but he's found no release from his unlucky Valentine's. \"It doesn't matter who I'm out with,\" he says. \"The day is just cursed.\" There are ways, though, to avoid a miserable holiday. Good plans . Most women will admit they like to celebrate, but a fancy night on the town isn't necessary. \"Sometimes, hanging out at home can be a lot more fun than going out to some restaurant filled with couples,\" says author McGuire. \"Stay home with champagne, caviar and maybe a new toy from a tasteful sex shop.\" If you're not dating anyone, take some time to indulge yourself (a luxurious bar of chocolate, a pedicure), do something relaxing (take a yoga class or get a massage) or spend time with some of your closest friends. Make sure you're on the same page . And if you do make plans, stick to them. Galen, a 28-year-old secretary from Seattle, and her boyfriend had made special Valentine's Day plans a month in advance. But on the big night, his buddies showed up and talked him into going out with them instead. \"I was dressed to the nines,\" says Galen, who asked that her last name not be used. \"When his friends stopped by, he says, 'Do you mind if I go with them?' I said, 'Fine, go,' being totally sarcastic, and he picked up his coat and left.\" Although they talked about it later, Galen said, her boyfriend seemed not to understand that she was unhappy with his wanting to ditch her for his buddies. The two later broke up. Breaking a date on Valentine's Day is definitely bad form, but automatically expecting one to happen (a much more common scenario) is also problematic. To avoid a disconnect with your significant other, McGuire suggests being honest. Simply expecting your partner to know what you want is unrealistic. Not-so-good gifts . If you decide to go the gift route, McGuire recommends not settling for a clich\u00e9 like a stuffed animal or a hastily purchased bouquet of flowers. \"Listen to what the person talks about,\" she says. \"She may want the new 'Godzilla' game for her Wii. His underwear may be riddled with holes.\" Another thing to avoid, advises Katie Briggs, 44, of Seattle, is the gag gift. A few years ago, Briggs and a new beau went out to a nice restaurant where they shared dinner, drinks and presents. Briggs gave her date homemade cookies and a Starbucks gift card. He gave her a beautifully-wrapped box -- of Spam. \"He thought it was the best joke ever,\" says Briggs. \"But it just wasn't thoughtful.

One of 14 \"high-value\" detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, alleges he was tortured. The motion, filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights attorneys on behalf of Majid Khan -- who is being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- is dated November 29. That is a week before CIA Director Michael Hayden acknowledged the agency destroyed videotapes it made in 2002 of interrogations of al Qaeda suspects using newly approved \"alternative\" interrogation techniques. Khan -- a native of Pakistan who attended high school in Baltimore -- was held for more than three years at the secret CIA prisons and \"subjected to an aggressive CIA detention and interrogation program notable for its elaborate planning and ruthless application of torture,\" attorney Gitanjali S. Gutierrez claims in the court documents. Details of Khan's torture claims are redacted in the filing -- a whole page is blacked out -- but Khan's attorneys say he suffers \"severe physical and psychological trauma from which he is unlikely ever to recover fully\" as a result of his ordeal. Asked about Khan's claims, CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano told CNN, \"CIA's terrorist interrogation effort has always been small, carefully run, lawful and highly productive. Fewer than 100 hardened terrorists have gone through the program since it began in 2002, and of those, less than a third required any special methods of questioning. The United States does not conduct or condone torture.\" Khan's attorneys claim he was taken into custody in 2003 and \"forcibly disappeared\" before his transfer to Guantanamo, \"where he remains imprisoned without charge or trial.\" He filed a legal challenge to his detention in September 2006 and appeared before a Combatant Status Review Tribunal in April, the court documents said. He was found to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant, but filed a challenge to that on August 14. He was not allowed to meet with an attorney, however, until October, the document said. The Bush administration contends Khan was an operative working for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, mastermind of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Khan researched how to blow up gas stations and poison reservoirs in the United States, the administration has said. He is among 14 \"high-value\" detainees held at Guantanamo. Gutierrez and another CCR attorney, Wells Dixon, also released declassified notes of their meetings with Khan, saying he has been on hunger strikes while in Guantanamo, is \"painfully thin and pale\" and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. In detention, he has been able to communicate with Abu Zubayda, an alleged lieutenant for Osama bin Laden, they said in the notes. A government official with knowledge of the destroyed CIA tapes has said that Zubayda was one of the two al Qaeda suspects whose interrogations were videotaped. While undergoing interrogation and torture by the CIA, \"Khan admitted anything his interrogators demanded of him, regardless of the truth, in order to end his suffering,\" the documents said. Without a court order requiring the preservation of evidence, \"there is substantial risk that the torture evidence will disappear\" and that may affect the challenge to his detention, the attorneys claim. The motion was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Hayden has said the CIA stopped videotaping in 2002, while Khan was not taken into custody until the following year. \"The careful, professional and lawful questioning of hardened terrorists has produced thousands of intelligence reports, revealed exceptionally valuable insights on al Qaeda's operations and organization, foiled terrorist plots and saved innocent lives,\" Gimigliano said. \"The information developed by the detention and interrogation program has been irreplaceable, and the program has operated in strict accord with American law.\" E-mail to a friend .

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad asked to visit ground zero, but New York city officials said no. The controversial, outspoken president wanted to \"pay his respects\" and lay a wreath at the site of the 2001 al Qaeda attacks during his visit to the U.N. General Assembly, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said, citing Iranian officials. But workers are rebuilding the foundations of the site, \"and it would not be possible for him to go where other people don't go,\" Kelly told CNN. Iranian officials have not put in any additional requests to visit the public platforms at ground zero, police spokesman Paul Browne told CNN. But, he said, \"If there were a further request, we'd reject it\" because of security fears.  Watch why New York said no to Iranian leader \u00bb . The Iranian mission to the U.N. said it had not been told of the decision, but in a statement issued Wednesday evening, it called the rejection \"unfortunate.\" Iran is ruled by a Shiite Muslim government hostile to the fundamentalist Sunni al Qaeda. Ahmadinejad's predecessor at the time of the September 11 attacks, Mohammed Khatami, condemned them, and Tehran cooperated with the U.S.-led campaign to topple al Qaeda's Taliban allies in Afghanistan that followed. The United States and Iran have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1980 after Iranian militants stormed the United States Embassy in Tehran and held Americans hostage for 444 days. The United States considers Iran a state sponsor of terrorism and has accused the country of meddling in Iraq and in Afghanistan where U.S. troops are battling Taliban and al Qaeda remnants more than six years after the September 11, 2001, attacks. More than 2,700 people died in the attack on the World Trade Center, when al Qaeda terrorists flew hijacked passenger jets into the twin towers. A third jet hit the Pentagon, and a fourth crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers resisted their hijackers. \"It is appalling that President Ahmadinejad, one of the world's leading sponsors of terror, would find it appropriate to visit this hallowed ground,\" State Department spokesman Tom Casey said. Several presidential candidates also condemned the requested visit. Hillary Clinton, the New York senator and Democratic front-runner, called the request \"unacceptable.\" Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a leading Republican, called it \"shockingly audacious.\" And former Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- whose leadership after the attacks is the cornerstone of his GOP presidential bid -- said that \"under no circumstances\" should Ahmadinejad be allowed to visit the World Trade Center site. Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the site should not be \"used as a photo op.\" Numerous critics have attacked Ahmadinejad's hard-line anti-Israel stance and his insistence that Iran will defy U.N. demands that it halt its production of enriched uranium. Iran insists it is producing nuclear fuel for civilian power plants, but Washington accuses Tehran of trying to produce a nuclear bomb. E-mail to a friend .

Lisa Nowak, accused of using pepper spray against a romantic rival, is set to go on trial in April. Ninth Judicial Circuit Judge Marc Lubet ruled that all were unlawfully obtained. He said his decision stemmed from a variety of factors, most concerning police tactics in their interview of Lisa Nowak and the fact that no written consent was obtained to search her car. \"In each and every case, this court must ensure that the constitutional protections afforded by our forefathers are scrupulously honored,\" Lubet wrote in his opinion. \"Unfortunately, in this case those protections were not as thoroughly followed as the law demands.\" Nowak, 44, is accused of stalking Air Force Capt. Colleen Shipman and using pepper spray against her in a parking lot at Orlando International Airport in Florida on February 5. She pleaded not guilty March 22 to charges of attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm, battery and burglary of a vehicle using a weapon. Her trial is set for April. If convicted, she would face a sentence of up to life in prison. Her defense attorneys had claimed Nowak's comments to police and her consent to search her car were made under duress. During a hearing held in August, Lubet heard testimony from, among others, Nowak, Shipman and Orlando police detective William Becton, who interviewed Nowak after her arrest. Lubet said in his ruling that when Nowak asked Becton if she needed an attorney during the interview, he failed to answer her question in a \"simple and straightforward manner.\" \"There was a concerted effort to minimize and downplay the significance of the Miranda rights by referring to these constitutional rights as 'formalities' \" during the interview, Lubet wrote. On the audiotape of the interview, there was no audible response from Nowak on whether she understood that her statements could be used against her in court, and when she was asked whether anyone had threatened or promised her anything to get her to talk to police, Lubet wrote. \"Thus, there is nothing in either the audio recording or the transcript of the interview that demonstrates that defendant understood these two rights and waived them.\" Nowak testified at the August hearing she did not respond to Becton's questions because she was confused, Lubet wrote. In addition, he said, Becton used \"legally impermissible\" statements and techniques, including threats, to get Nowak's statements and consent. \"Well, what you say can change what you're charged with,\" Becton said at one point. \"Right now we're looking at [a] possible life felony of carjacking.\" In a written statement, an Orlando Police Department spokeswoman said it was inappropriate for the department to comment on the case since it is pending in court, and referred questions to prosecutors. Lubet noted that, although Nowak was given the opportunity to use the restroom and was asked if she wanted something to eat, she was \"subjected to a barrage of questions\" beginning in the predawn hours and was questioned for six hours without being given the opportunity to sleep or make a phone call. \"Defendant had not slept during the preceding 24 hours,\" the judge said. Nowak's consent to search her car, Lubet wrote, \"followed illegal police activity, such as a prolonged detention, threats to obtain a warrant and repeated requests for consent.\" Prosecutors accuse Nowak of driving nearly 900 miles from Houston to Orlando -- wearing NASA diapers to cut down on the number of stops she needed to make -- and donning a disguise before following Shipman from baggage claim to a parking lot. Her attorney has strongly denied that she wore the diapers. Shipman told police that after she got into her car, Nowak feigned distress and knocked on the window. When Shipman cracked it to talk to her, Nowak sprayed her in the face with pepper spray, Shipman said. Police said Nowak was detained as she was disposing of her disguise in an airport trash bin. Nowak has said she merely went to the airport to talk to Shipman, who had begun dating Nowak's former love interest, Navy Cmdr. Bill Oefelein, who was also an astronaut but has since left the astronaut corps. At the August hearing, Becton testified that when he searched Nowak's car, he found maps showing how to reach the airport, maps of the airport's layout, a buck knife and papers including a letter Nowak appeared to have written to Oefelein's mother. He also testified he found used and clean diapers in the car. Police previously said they also found a BB gun, a steel mallet, a 4-inch knife and rubber tubing in the vehicle. Nowak's attorneys in August filed a notice of intent to rely on an insanity defense, saying in court documents her diagnoses include a litany of more than a dozen psychiatric disorders. On August 30, Lubet granted Nowak's attorneys' request that her electronic tracking ankle bracelet be removed. E-mail to a friend .

She is a forensic artist whose job is to give faces -- and sometimes identities -- back to anonymous murder victims who have been robbed of both. Armed with sculptor's clay, glass eyes, wigs and research, Long creates a face from a human skull. When Fort Myers, Florida, police found eight sets of human remains in the woods in March, they turned to her -- anything to help identify the people who were so mercilessly left to rot amid the trees and mud. \"[Police] have no other way. They have no fingerprints; they have no flesh. Usually, the last resort is building a face,\" Long said.  See the \"skull lady\" at work \u00bb . She hopes that when the faces of those killed get printed in newspapers or appear on TV or online, a friend or loved one recognizes them and says, \"Gee, we haven't seen so-and-so for a while, and that kind of looks like him.\" \"Then, at least, you have a lead, and then you can get DNA from people. And then [police] have something to go on.\" Long, 67, has made faces for the unknown victims of grisly homicides and solved historical mysteries. During her 20-year career, the forensics specialist from the University of Wyoming helped identify the crew of the H.L Hunley, a Confederate submarine sunk during the Civil War. She also created the first picture of the only explorer to have died on the Lewis and Clark expedition. When law enforcement asks for Long's assistance, it is almost always on a case that has gone very cold. And that was exactly the case in Fort Myers, where police were desperate for any information on the dead they found: eight men killed, their bodies discovered in a wooded area on March 23, 2007.  Watch how bones can give clues to investigators \u00bb . There were no witnesses, no leads and little evidence of killings other than the victims' bones. If Long could identify the victims of the crime, it might help to catch a serial killer. But before Long could create any likeness of the victims, she would have to do a lot of work -- hundreds of hours of it. Long first creates a mold of the skull and uses it to make a plaster replica. She puts eraser tips on points to mark tissue depth. Sculptor's clay fills in for skin and muscle. The faded gumline on the skull's teeth helps Long determine how thick the person's lips were. The victim's hair and eye color requires guesswork and research, Long says. Often while working on cases, she talks to people who lived in the same area as the victim or victims to find out the most common eye color and what hairstyles are in fashion.  See how to decode a face \u00bb . She spent two months on the Fort Myers skulls. \"I start working, and 15 hours can go by, and I don't get up and move, and you don't realize how much time has gone by, and, well, that's how intense I get,\" she said. \"It's like you get carried away in this life of somebody. I start trying to think of them as being an alive person and doing something and not getting killed.\" Eventually, publicity about the Fort Myers case would lead people with missing relatives to submit their DNA. Testing revealed that two of the men were Erik Kohler and John Blevins. Both men lived hardscrabble lives and had run-ins with police. Both disappeared in 1995. At a news conference last month where Fort Myers police unveiled Long's sculptures, investigators said they still need to identify the other six victims if they are to solve the case. Kohler and Blevins didn't closely mirror Long's sculptures of their faces, but there were some similarities, some facial features that looked liked the two dead men. And that's what police say they want: They hope people with missing relatives will look at every detail of the other six sculptures to see whether they notice any resemblance, no matter how faint. \"Going into this, I knew there would be some level of subjectivity in the art part of it, but I think what it does is generate the interest,\" Fort Myers Police Detective Barry Lewis said. \"I am just looking for that one little similarity, that one little key that someone could recognize that they could make a call that that is their loved one.\" Since the news conference, police say, they have received hundreds of leads. Long's work on the case might be done, but she still has nightmares about the eight men killed. \"I hear screaming, and I hear pleading, and I hear all these things which I couldn't imagine,\" she said. \"I can see somebody dragging a body out there, and here he kept taking them to the same area. I think, what in the hell is wrong with this guy?\" Six of those killed remain nameless. And police are still trying to find the killer. Authorities urge anyone with more information on the case to call 877-667-1296.

Zookeepers fear the unnamed polar bear cub could be at risk of being eaten. The cub, which doesn't yet have a name, was being cared for at Nuremberg City Zoo, where it was resting under heat lamps and is drinking formula. \"It's gaining weight, it's very hungry, it drinks a lot of milk,\" said Alexandra Foghammar, a spokeswoman for the city. The zoo announced Thursday that the cub is female. Wednesday, the zoo said keepers decided to take the cub away from its mother, Vera, because the mother was showing signs of being upset and confused, taking her baby in and out of the animals' enclosure. \"We were 100 percent sure that the baby was going to die if we didn't take it away from her,\" Nuremberg zoo director Dag Encke told Time magazine. \"This would have been a death verdict for the cub.\" The zoo confirmed earlier this week that its other female polar bear, Vilma, had eaten her two offspring. The zoo said it feared Vera would do the same, so it took her cub away as a precaution. Since then, the cub is thriving in the care of humans, but Vera seems to miss her cub, Foghammar said.  Watch how zoo has faced criticism over polar bears. \u00bb . \"The mother is a little bit nervous,\" she said. \"She walks around and is searching for the baby, but the responsible persons for the zoo say this is normal. It will continue for three or four days. It's a normal situation.\" The zookeepers are pondering whether to bring another adult bear, possibly the cub's father, Felix, to the zoo to help Vera overcome her loss, and are seeking another small bear to serve as a companion for the rescued cub, Time reported. The zoo said a keeper entered Vilma's enclosure Monday and noticed that her two cubs were nowhere to be found. The zoo said it assumes Vilma ate her young because she believed the cubs were sick, though zookeepers say the cubs were last seen on Sunday and appeared in good health. But Foghammar told Time that the separation of the bears was bad for the \"principle of wildlife conservation\" at the zoo: \"Now the cub will not grow up to act in a natural way, just as the mother lacked the experience to bring up a cub.\" The plight of the cub follows the case last year of Knut, a cub rejected by its mother at Berlin Zoo who became the focus of a media frenzy after animal rights campaigners called for it to be killed, claiming it had become too dependent on humans.

They wanted to hear the details. I kept telling them I would stop with details, but they wanted to hear them,\" he told CNN in a phone interview this week. At one point, the parents also met with security guard Jeanne Assam, who shot their son in the leg before he turned his gun on himself. The parents thanked Assam for her swift action and for helping save more lives, said Casey Nikoloric, a Murray family spokeswoman and long-time friend. \"They told Assam that they were so deeply sorry she had to do what she did,\" said Nikoloric. \"There were tears, lots of embraces, prayers.\" The visit, she said, was \"very, very, very important\" in the healing process for the Murrays as they deal with the loss of their son and the terror he inflicted. Boyd agreed. \"I thought this would be best for the Murrays,\" he said, adding that it touched everyone involved. \"I've never seen repentance and forgiveness as profound as I did that day.\" The Murrays toured the church with their other son, Christopher, 20, a student at Oral Roberts University. The Murrays met the Works in Boyd's office. He said he also asked the Murrays to share \"some of the good memories\" of Matthew as a boy. \"It put it in context: This kid was raised in an upper middle-class home and had every chance to do well,\" Boyd said. \"You wonder what went wrong for Matthew. They described Matthew as any parent would describe their son.\" The pastor said he didn't tell many people about the meeting before it happened, fearing it \"could have gotten volatile and hostile.\" \"It was risky, but I knew enough about the Murrays to know they were mature and good people,\" he said.

The Murrays visited the mission center December 12 and met with the families of the slain victims, according to Nikoloric. \"The depth of our sorrow and our grief is greater than we could possibly describe,\" the Murrays said in a written statement. \"But with thanks to God, these remarkable families and their pastors and churches, healing and reconciliation have begun.\" E-mail to a friend .", "bdcc1253f679b14e54451db44f4f0e39af4bb559": "SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- More than a dozen uncontained wildfires raged Monday across Southern California, threatening thousands of structures and forcing people to flee homes from San Diego to Malibu to Lake Arrowhead. This photo taken from space Monday afternoon shows smoke rising from the wildfires in Southern California. Fire officials said more than 265,000 people have been evacuated and nearly 4,900 firefighters are battling the fast-moving blazes, which began over the weekend. By Monday afternoon, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention had reported 13 active wildfires have consumed more than 98,000 acres and destroyed or damaged at least 50 homes and businesses across six counties. The winds driving the flames are expected to stay strong, coming out of the northeast, at least through Tuesday, according to CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano. \"It's a tragic time for California,\" California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said earlier Monday. He declared a state of emergency in seven counties and asked the National Guard to pull 800 soldiers from patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border to help battle the wildfires. Monday evening, Schwarzenegger asked U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates to order delivery of all available Modular Airborne Fire Fighting Systems (MAFFS) to help fight the fires.  Watch fires devour homes and land \u00bb . Citing the proliferation in the number of fires, Schwarzenegger wrote, \"Your immediate assistance is necessary to deploy Department of Defense aircraft located in Wyoming, North Carolina and Colorado to assist California in our firefighting effort.\" According to the White House, the federal Agriculture Department will provide fire crews, air tankers and helicopters to fight the fires, and the state will receive assistance grants to help pay firefighting costs.  See where fires burn across Southern California \u00bb . Hardest hit was San Diego County, where 250,000 people have fled from five fires. One person was killed and 18 were reported injured in the county, including five firefighters. Local officials said the fire situation had worsened throughout the day, prompting new evacuations. \"We have a very dangerous, unpredictable situation,\" said Ron Roberts, chairman of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. \"We have some of the highest temperatures, some of the driest landscape conditions and some of the most powerful winds -- all the ingredients for a perfect firestorm.\" On one cul-de-sac in the San Diego suburb of  Rancho Bernardo, five of six homes burned to the ground, leaving flames from gas lines flickering amid the ruins, according to a KGTV report.  See photos of the fires \u00bb . Officials turned Qualcomm Stadium, home of the NFL's San Diego Chargers, into an evacuation center. Residents of four housing areas at the Camp Pendleton Marine base in northern San Diego County were put on notice for possible evacuations and told to pack personal belongings as a precautionary measure. Earlier Monday, fixed-wing firefighting aircraft were grounded by the strong winds, officials said, making the jobs of fire crews on the ground even harder. Fires threatened the San Diego Zoo's Wild Animal Park on Monday, causing the park to close. Some of the animals, such as endangered condors, are being moved to a safer location, according to zoo spokeswoman Yadira Galindo. Authorities are asking people to hold off on 911 calls unless there is a real emergency, saying clogged cell phone lines are hurting rescue efforts. The largest of the wildfires was the Buckweed blaze north of Los Angeles, which has consumed 27,500 acres and forced the evacuation of 15,000 residents from Santa Clarita and nearby communities, according to the state forestry department. About 4,000 structures were threatened, and the fire was moving toward the Magic Mountain amusement park. Two fires that erupted Monday morning in San Bernardino County near Lake Arrowhead have destroyed at least 123 structures and charred 1,800 acres, said Loretta Benavidez, a spokeswoman for the San Bernardino National Forest. Several communities in the area, including Green Valley Lake, Arrowbear and Running Springs, were evacuated. And in Malibu Canyon, south of the Pacific Coast Highway, nearly 1,450 firefighters were battling a blaze that began Sunday afternoon and still threatened 900 structures in the area, which is home to many Hollywood luminaries, the state forestry department said. The Canyon fire is only 10 percent contained, an official said. The Pacific Coast Highway remains shut down in Malibu. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 CNN.

With a map of alleged victims, Jonathan Reiter makes his case Wednesday at a New York news conference. Attorney Jonathan Reiter said his clients are seeking \"damages for terrorism, war crimes ... and wrongful death.\" The plaintiffs are asking for $10 million in compensatory damages and $10 million in punitive damages for each of the 393 victims named in the suit. Earlier this year, Chiquita, as part of a plea agreement, admitted that what it called protection payments had been given to Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, or AUC. AUC was named a terrorist organization by the United States in 2002, making it a crime to give them money. The lawsuit alleges Chiquita's interaction with the paramilitary group went further than the payments -- it accuses the company of facilitating shipments of arms to the group. \"They conspired with the AUC, aided and abetted them in a far-reaching conspiracy and plan to control every aspect of banana growing, distribution and sale,\" Reiter said. The attorney said one couple refused to sell their banana farm \"for pennies\" and were killed by AUC in 2001, and other murder victims had been directed to \"sell their bananas only to Chiquita.\" The families filing the suit will remain anonymous because of fear of reprisals in their home country, he said. \"The principle upon which this lawsuit is brought is that when you put money into the hands of terrorists, when you put guns into the hands of terrorists, then you are legally responsible for the atrocities, the murders and the tortures that those terrorists commit,\" Reiter said. Responding to the allegations Wednesday afternoon, the company said, \"Chiquita Brands International categorically denies the allegations made by these attorneys. We reiterate that Chiquita and its employees were victims and that the actions taken by the company were always motivated to protect the lives of our employees and their families.\" Chiquita's director of communications, Michael Mitchell, went on to say, \"Our company had been forced to make protection payments to safeguard our workforce. It is absolutely untrue for anyone to suggest that these payments were made for any other purpose.\" Mitchell said the company will fight the allegations. \"Chiquita has already been the victim of extortion in Colombia. We will not allow ourselves to become extortion victims in the United States.\" In the March plea agreement, Chiquita Brands International agreed to pay a $25 million fine for the payments made by the company's former banana-producing subsidiary in Colombia.

Police believe 2-year-old Riley Ann Sawyers is \"Baby Grace.\" The affidavit says the girl's mother, Kimberly Dawn Trenor, described to police how her daughter died and was put in a plastic storage box that Trenor and her husband, Royce Zeigler, later dumped into a Galveston waterway. Trenor told police Zeigler tried to commit suicide the weekend before Thanksgiving, and wrote a note that said, \"My wife is innocent of the sins that I committed.\" The body of the then-unidentified toddler was found on October 29. A fisherman found Riley's body stuffed inside a blue storage container that washed up on an uninhabited island in Galveston's West Bay. A medical examiner said the child's skull was fractured, and a forensic dentist estimated her age at 2 to 3 years. Police dubbed the child \"Baby Grace.\"  A police artist's sketch of her was widely circulated in the news media and prompted a call to Galveston police from Riley's grandmother in Ohio, who had not seen the girl in months. On Saturday, police arrested Trenor and Zeigler on charges of injuring a child and tampering with physical evidence, the sheriff's department said. Their bonds were set at $350,000 each. The affidavit, obtained by CNN, says when police interviewed Trenor on November 23, she \"gave a voluntary statement on video with her attorney present in which she describes her involvement, with Royce Zeigler, in the physical abuse, death and disposal of the remains of her daughter, Riley Ann Sawyers.\" Trenor's statement said on July 24, she and Zeigler both beat the child with leather belts and held her head under water in the bathtub. She said Zeigler picked the girl up by her hair and also threw her across the room, slamming her head into the tile floor. After her daughter died, Trenor's statement said, she and Zeigler went to a Wal-Mart that night and bought the Sterilite container, a shovel, concrete mix, and other supplies. The statement said the box containing the child's body was hidden in a storage shed for \"one to two months.\"  Then, Trenor said, she and Zeigler carried it to the Galveston Causeway and tossed it in, and she saw it drifting away. Riley Ann's father, Robert Sawyers, on Monday tearfully remembered her as a \"fun-loving girl ... with a big imagination.\"  Watch Riley Ann's father describe the little girl \u00bb . Riley was \"very active, very hyper, but also very well-behaved,\" Sawyers told reporters in Mentor, Ohio. She would play \"with a water hose ... spraying the whole patio soaking wet until she was done with it,\" he said, as he sat behind two photographs of his daughter, a toddler with wispy blond curls. Robert Sawyers' mother, Sheryl Sawyers, said the family was \"devastated\" to learn that police believe Riley is dead. \"It's hard to think that I'll never see her again,\" she said, clutching a red Elmo doll she had planned to give Riley for Christmas. Maj. Ray Tuttoilmondo of the Galveston County Sheriff's Department said Monday that authorities are \"fairly confident\" that the toddler whose body was found on October 29 is Riley Ann Sawyers. DNA analysis is still in progress to confirm the identification. The results will be available in two to three weeks, Tuttoilmondo said. Tuttoilmondo said Riley is originally from Mentor, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb, and that \"she and her mother came down to Texas earlier this year.\" The toddler was last seen in Texas \"three or four months ago,\" Tuttoilmondo said, although he did not know by whom. Tuttoilmondo said police did investigate whether Child Protective Services had taken Riley away, something the mother had reportedly alleged. Of that report, Tuttoilmondo said, \"What we believe is that is not what happened.\" The affidavit said Trenor admitted that after the body was found, Zeigler had her type up a fake letter from the Ohio Department of Children's Services saying that Riley was to be taken away. Trenor left Ohio in late May, after filing an allegation of domestic violence against Robert Sawyers and reaching a joint voluntary agreement that gave her custody of Riley and gave Robert Sawyers visitation rights, the Sawyers' family lawyer said Monday. \"She disappeared,\" Laura DePledge said Monday at the Ohio news conference with the Sawyers. Sheryl Sawyers said Monday that she saw widely distributed police sketches of \"Baby Grace\" and contacted Galveston police in November. The girl in the police sketches strongly resembles photos of Riley. \"No, I never did think it would end up like this,\" Sheryl Sawyers said Monday, eyes welling. \"I guess knowing is better than not knowing.\" The girl's family in Ohio has been \"very helpful\" in this case, Tuttoilmondo said, adding that the FBI and a Galveston County police officer visited the family in Ohio on Sunday. DePledge said Riley was the product of a \"teenage pregnancy.\" Trenor and Robert Sawyers were together for two years as a result of the pregnancy, DePledge said, during which time they lived with Sheryl Sawyers. DePledge said Monday that the family, whose grief she described as \"simply overwhelming,\" wants Riley's body returned to Ohio for a memorial service. \"What Riley needs is to be brought home,\" she said. \"I think this family needs some closure.\" Tuttoilmondo asked anyone who knew the child or her family to help detectives reconstruct the events of Riley's short life. The toddler's case has touched even hardened police officers, he said. \"Any way you look at it, we carry a piece of her with us, and we'll always carry a little piece of her with us,\" he said Monday. He held up a small, pink-and-white shoe identical to those the child was wearing when she was found.  \"That says it all. A little-bitty shoe.\" E-mail to a friend .

The recalled products are all ground beef patties with various brand names. In a statement, the Elizabeth, New Jersey, company said the hamburger patties may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, a bacterium that can cause severe diarrhea and cramps, as well as other complications. A statement from the U.S. Department of Agriculture said 25 illnesses are under investigation in Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Maine, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The ground beef products being recalled have a \"sell by date\" or a \"best if used by date\" between September 25, 2007, and September 25, 2008, Topps' statement said.  Watch the latest on the beef recall \u00bb . The packages also have the marking \"Est. 9748\" inside the USDA mark of inspection. Tuesday, the company announced a recall of about 331,000 pounds of hamburger meat, according to the USDA. \"Because the health and safety of our consumers is our top priority, we are taking these expansive measures,\" said Vice President of Operations Geoffrey Livermore in the statement. \"Topps is continuing to work with the USDA, state departments of health, retailers and distributors to ensure the safety of our consumers. Additionally, we have augmented our internal quality control procedures with microbiologists and food safety experts. We sincerely regret any inconvenience and concerns this may cause our consumers,\" Livermore said. This is the company's first recall in its 65 years of business, the statement said. Consumers who find the products at home are asked to cut off the UPC code and return it to Topps for a full refund, then dispose of the product immediately, Topps spokeswoman Michelle Williams said. The company said to avoid E. coli, consumers should wash hands thoroughly after handling the beef. Topps set up a toll-free recall help line at (888) 734-0451. Williams said because the products may have been produced up to a year ago, many of them have already been safely consumed. Production in the ground beef area of the company's plant in Elizabeth has been shut down until all the investigations are complete, Williams said in a phone interview. \"We're working with the USDA and the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and conducting our own investigation,\" she added. The products, all ground beef patties and hamburgers with various brand names, were distributed mainly in the northeastern United States, but went to retailers in many other areas of the country as well, Williams said. While the sheer size of the recall is large, two other companies have been involved in larger recalls. In 2002, Pilgrim's Pride recalled more than 27 million pounds of poultry, and Hudson Foods recalled 25 million pounds of ground beef in 1997.

A new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll suggests the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination between Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois is a statistical dead heat in Texas, which holds primaries March 4. In the survey, out Monday, 50 percent of likely Democratic primary voters support Clinton as their choice for the party's nominee, with 48 percent backing Obama. But taking into account the poll's sampling error of plus or minus 4\u00bd percentage points for Democratic respondents, the race is a virtual tie.  Watch Democrats target Texas. \u00bb . Two recent polls by other organizations also show the race statistically even. Map: National and state polling . \"One reason the race appears to be tight is that Texas Democrats are having a hard time choosing between two attractive options,\" says CNN polling director Keating Holland. \"Likely Democratic primary voters would be equally happy if either candidate won the nomination, and they don't see a lot of difference between them on several top issues. \"Roughly a quarter of likely voters say they could change their minds in the next two weeks -- and not surprisingly, those people are splitting roughly equally between Clinton and Obama.\" Many political strategists and analysts consider Texas and Ohio -- which also holds a March 4 primary -- must-win states for Clinton. Obama has won the past eight contests and is now ahead in the overall battle for delegates, 193 of which are at stake in Texas. The new survey indicates Arizona Sen. John McCain is the clear favorite for the Republican presidential nomination. Among Republicans, 55 percent of likely Texas GOP primary voters support McCain as their choice for nominee. Thirty-two percent back former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and 11 percent support home-state congressman and former Libertarian standard-bearer Ron Paul. The poll's sampling error for Republican respondents is 4 percentage points. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted by telephone from Friday through Sunday. Pollsters talked to 1,506 adults in Texas, including 553 likely Republican primary voters and 529 likely Democratic primary voters. McCain is the overwhelming front-runner in the fight for the Republican presidential nomination and party leaders have rallied around the candidate in an attempt for party unity. The poll was released on the same day the only living former Republican president -- George Herbert Walker Bush, the current president's father -- endorsed McCain at an event in Houston.  Watch McCain get a big boost \u00bb . But McCain has had trouble winning conservative voters. Just last week, McCain lost the conservative vote to Huckabee in the Virginia primary, according to exit polls. The new survey, though, suggests McCain may have better luck in Texas. \"It looks like McCain has made some inroads with conservative Republicans,\" Holland said. \"McCain is picking up a bare majority among conservative likely voters in the GOP primary. The McCain campaign probably wishes that number were higher, but it does mean that a McCain victory in Texas would not be based on the votes of moderates and independents, as has happened in several states in the past few weeks.\" Texas Democrats and Republicans may not see eye to eye on the issues, but the poll suggests they do agree on what's the most important issue. Thirty-five percent of Democrats and an equal number of Republicans said the economy was the most important issue in their choice for president. The second most important issue for Democrats was health care, at 23 percent, followed by the war in Iraq at 22 percent, illegal immigration at 10 percent and terrorism at 7 percent. Nineteen percent of Republicans said illegal immigration was their most important issue, putting it in second place, followed by the war in Iraq and terrorism at 17 percent and health care at 8 percent. Sixty percent of Republicans say they'll definitely support the candidate they are now backing. That number climbs to 76 percent for Democrats. Likely Democratic primary voters view Clinton and Obama on roughly equal terms. Seventy-nine percent say they would be satisfied if Clinton were the nominee; an equal number feel the same way about Obama. Seventy-nine percent say it's likely Clinton can win the nomination; 82 percent say the same about Obama. The two candidates are essentially tied on immigration, Iraq and the economy, but Clinton has an advantage on health care and abortion.

Brazilian genius Kaka fully deserves winning the 2007 World Footballer of the Year award. The prestigious Ballon d'Or award is widely regarded as the most prestigious individual prize in football and Kaka's inclusion on its coveted roll of honor is a testament to the 25-year-old Brazilian's current standing in world football. When AC Milan defeated Liverpool in the Champions League final in Athens, avenging their heartbreaking loss to the same team in Istanbul two years previously, it enabled Kaka to fulfill his dream of holding aloft Europe's premier trophy -- a winner's medal he fully deserved after a sublime 90-minute performance. Kaka's stock for both club and country has risen steadily since his move to the San Siro from Sao Paulo for a fee of just $8.5 million in the summer of 2003. Unlike many a Brazilian sporting genius, Kaka did not hone his skills on the beach or the streets of a favela shanty town. He was born into a comfortable middle class Brasilia family, where football was not the only hope of a bright future. However, it soon became clear that this particular boy had a very special skill and he was signed by Sao Paulo, after his family had moved there, at just eight years of age -- making his first team debut as an 18-year-old. Kaka's progress was soon picked up by his national team coach and Felipe Scolari named the graceful midfielder in his 23-man squad for the 2002 World Cup finals, earning him a winners' medal despite playing only 19 minutes of the tournament in a group match against Costa Rica. A year later, and Kaka was on his way to Milan. Within a month he had made the starting line-up and his 10 goals helped the Rossoneri lift the Scudetto and the European Super Cup. Throughout his career, Kaka has always possessed the innate ability to score goals -- his record for both club and country sees him average roughly a goal every three games. Yet to describe Kaka merely as a goalscoring midfielder would be doing him a massive injustice. Tall, elegant and blessed with astonishing skill, Milan and Brazil utilize Kaka's ability superbly. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti soon recognized Kaka's genius, changing his team's system to a 4-4-1-1, playing the Brazilian behind a main target man. With Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso holding the central midfield area, Kaka has a license to roam in behind the lone striker, be it Filippo Inzaghi, Ronaldo or Alberto Gilardino. And Kaka does this with devastating effect, running at the opposition with pace and power, finding defense-splitting passes or shooting from range with deadly accuracy be it from a dead-ball situation or open play. The fly in the ointment for Milan comes in the shape of their poor form this season. Although they have already reached the last 16 of the Champions League, the club are floundering in Serie A and face the unthinkable prospect of not qualifying for next season's competition unless they win the trophy. Real Madrid have coveted Kaka for the last two years -- expect the world transfer record to be smashed if Milan don't secure a place among Europe's elite.

An audit found \"significant breakdown in internal controls\" at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. An audit completed last month by the National Archives and Records Administration's inspector general looked at the management of presidential artifacts at six presidential libraries. It \"cites particular issues at the Ronald Reagan Library. ... We acknowledge that problems exist in inventory control at the Reagan library,\" said a statement from Allen Weinstein, national archivist. Inspector General Paul Brachfield was more blunt. A \"significant breakdown in internal controls\" was found at the Reagan library, in Simi Valley, California, he said in a statement Thursday. The audit results prompted the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation to urge the National Archives -- which is responsible for maintaining the artifacts -- to move quickly to fix the problems. The chairman of the board of trustees has contacted Weinstein \"to express the serious concerns and disappointment on behalf of the Reagan Foundation and Mrs. Reagan,\" the foundation said. Library officials told auditors that \"the collection contained approximately 100,000 items, yet the library systems only had information to locate and account for approximately 20,000 items,\" Brachfield said. \"This does not automatically mean the approximately 80,000 remaining items are missing. The vast majority may very well be safely located within the library's storage facilities. ... Some of these items may be missing or stolen, or none of these items may be missing or stolen.\" Control deficiencies at the library created an environment that could potentially have been exploited, Brachfield said. Although Congress has a copy of the audit, it has not yet been made public because of the ongoing investigation into the whereabouts of the items. The count of 100,000 was an estimate taken from the original Reagan White House Gift Unit database, Weinstein said Thursday, but was never meant to be used as a concrete inventory control number. The Reagan library has already begun implementing recommendations from the audit, he said. It has upgraded its management inventory software, is hiring additional trained museum staff, has begun a comprehensive inventory and is addressing storage issues by reshelving artifacts and taking steps to protect artifacts in case of an earthquake. \"Like all of the presidential libraries, the Reagan library stores their gifts in a locked vault, which is protected by a security camera,\" Weinstein said. The audit examined management of artifacts at the Reagan library; the Franklin D. Roosevelt library; the John F. Kennedy library; the Gerald R. Ford library; the George Bush library; and the William J. Clinton library, Weinstein said. \"Early collections of artifacts came to presidential libraries with few controls and incomplete information relating to the collections,\" he said.

Kevin Rudd and French President Nicolas Sarkozy flew into the Afghan capital, Kabul, on Saturday to meet with Karzai and visit their respective country's troops participating in the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. In a morning meeting, Sarkozy \"assured President Karzai of his government's long term political and military support with the people of Afghanistan,\" according to a statement from the Afghan president's office.

Vick, 27, voluntarily turned himself in around noon, said Kevin Trevillan of the Marshals Service, and is being held at Northern Neck Regional Jail in Warsaw, Virginia, until the sentencing hearing. The quarterback, who has been suspended indefinitely by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, faces 12 to 18 months in prison on the charge. Vick pleaded guilty in August after three associates admitted their own roles in the operation and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. \"From the beginning, Mr. Vick has accepted responsibility for his actions and his self-surrender further demonstrates that acceptance,\"  Vick's attorney, Billy Martin, said in a statement. \"Michael wants to again apologize to everyone who has been hurt in this matter and he thanks all of the people who have offered him and his family prayers and support during this time,\" Martin's statement said. CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin speculated that Vick started his sentence early \"to get it out of the way.\" Watch Toobin explain why Vick would surrender early \u00bb . On September 25, a Virginia grand jury indicted Vick and the three co-defendants -- Purnell Peace, 35, of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Quanis Phillips, 28, of Atlanta, Georgia; and Tony Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Virginia -- on state charges of running a dogfighting ring at Vick's home outside Newport News. The Surry County grand jury brought two charges against the four men: one count of unlawfully torturing and killing dogs and one of promoting dogfights. Each is a felony charge that could result in a five-year prison term. In addition, Taylor faces three additional counts of unlawful torture and killing of dogs. A hearing in that case is set for November 27, but Vick does not have to be in court at that time. In September, Vick was put under tight restrictions by the federal court after he tested positive for marijuana use. Vick tested positive for the drug on September 13, a court document from the Eastern District of Virginia shows. As a result, U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson ordered Vick to \"submit to any method of testing required by the pretrial services officer or the supervising officer for determining whether the defendant is using a prohibited substance.\" Those methods could include random drug testing, a remote alcohol testing system \"and/or any form of prohibited substance screening or testing,\" the order said. Vick was also ordered to stay home between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., \"or as directed by the pretrial services officer or supervising officer,\" the order said. He was to be electronically monitored during that time. Vick must participate in substance abuse therapy and mental health counseling \"if deemed advisable by the pretrial services officer or supervising officer\" at his own expense, the order said.

Pope Benedict XVI is presented with a football by Ancona club officials. Italian football has been tarnished in recent seasons by corruption, match-fixing scandals and crowd trouble, but the pope insisted the sport celebrated positive virtues as well. \"The sport of football can be a vehicle of education for the values of honesty, solidarity and fraternity, especially for the younger generation,\" the pope said, according to Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper. The comments are not the first foray by the Bavarian-born pope -- reputedly a Bayern Munich supporter -- into Italian football. In October, he was presented with a No. 16 shirt by officials of the lower league club Ancona after the Vatican endorsed its campaign to turn itself into a \"beacon of morality\" by adopting an \"innovative, ethical model of practising football,\" Reuters reported. The code committed Ancona to promoting fair play in a family atmosphere. The club is currently second in Serie C1/B, Italian football's third tier league. \"Football should increasingly become a tool for the teaching of life's ethical and spiritual values,\" the pope said. Pope Benedict XVI's predecessor, Pope John Paul II, was also a keen football fan, reportedly playing in goal during his youth in Poland. All Italian football matches were cancelled on the weekend following his death in 2005.

Pojamarn Shinawatra with her husband Thaksin Shinawatra. According to Pichit Chuenban, Pojamarn Shinawatra was presented with an arrest warrant shortly after arriving at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi International Airport and was escorted by authorities to the Supreme Court. \"She intends to fight all charges through judicial system,\" Pichit said. Greeted by about 50 well-wishers, Pojamarn arrived at court accompanied by her three children. She faces charges stemming from a Bangkok land deal and a stock concealment plan that could put her in jail for up to eight years, according to the Thai News Agency. The court released her on 5 million baht (about $168,000) bail and ordered her not to leave the country. On Monday, Thaksin's attorney Noppadon Pattama said the former prime minister would return from exile in mid-April to answer to the same charges his wife faces. He was deposed by a military junta in Sept. 2006 and fled to London. He plans to return after Thailand's new government is in place. In December's parliamentary elections, supporters of Thaksin, the People Power Party, won nearly half the seats in the lower house and will lead the ruling coalition. PPP leader Samak Sundaravej said a new parliament controlled by his party would pass an amnesty law to allow Thaksin's return and amend the constitution to let Thaksin get back into politics.

Firefighters in a Paris suburb battle to control a blaze started after youths rioted Sunday night. An angry mob repeatedly clashed with riot police and torched cars and buildings in the town of Villiers-le-Bel, north of Paris, after two teens on a motorcycle were killed following a collision with a police car Sunday night. Rioters bombarded police with baseball bats, Molotov cocktail bombs and bottles filled with acid as the violence spread to the nearby towns of Longjumeau and Grigby Monday night. The 15- and 16-year-old boys, both sons of African immigrants, according to police, died when their motorbike hit a patrol car in Villiers-le-Bel. Some residents, populated largely by immigrants and their French-born children, accused police of fleeing the crash scene. However, three eyewitnesses, interviewed on TV, said the police stayed and tried to revive the two boys with mouth to mouth resuscitation.  Watch why a repeat of past rioting is feared \u00bb . More than 60 police officers were injured in Monday night's confrontation, with five kept in hospital in a serious condition, according to reports in a number of French newspapers. A spokesman for the police authorities in the Val d'Oise prefecture refused to confirm the numbers of police injuries, telling CNN that police feared the information could further enflame the already tense situation. The police spokesman said 60 cars, a library and car dealer's showroom had been set on fire in Villiers-le-Bel. He said a police station had also been damaged and 15 garbage cans torched. Security was tightened Tuesday, with helicopters deployed to patrol over the town, the spokesman said. Villiers-le-Bel was not among the districts hit by the weeks of nationwide rioting in November 2005, when disaffected youths nationwide set thousands of cars ablaze to protest against unemployment and discrimination. Those riots were also sparked by fatalities, namely the deaths of two men of North African descent who were electrocuted while hiding from police in an electrical substation. French president Nicolas Sarkozy, then serving as the interior minister, provoked controversy at the time by referring to the rioters as \"scum.\" Sarkozy, currently on a state visit to China, had urged residents Monday to \"cool down and let the justice system determine who is responsible for what.\" A spokesman for the president's office told CNN Tuesday they were continuing to monitor the situation. The prosecutor's office in the nearby town of Pontoise has already begun an inquiry into the deaths. Police said the teens drove through a red light without wearing helmets and on an unregistered bike. But Omar Sehhouli, the brother of one of the victims, told French media the police involved should be arrested. \"Everyone knew the two boys here,\" he told French radio. \"What happened, that's not violence, it's rage.\" According to the initial findings from the French police watchdog, reported Tuesday in the daily newspaper, Le Figaro, the boy's motorbike was driving \"at very high speed\" and had failed to give priority to the police patrol vehicle.

But away from the tragic human cost, the unrest has also provoked concerns about the stability of the east African country's economy, until now seen as a model for the region. Businesses have been destroyed and looted and supply routes disrupted after the opposition accused incumbent president Mwai Kibaki of election fraud after he was declared winner Sunday. Investors are watching events closely in the country, fearful of how it could affect one of Africa's few economic success stories. And the early signs have been worrying. The equity market on the Nairobi Stock Exchange lost 40 billion Kenyan Shillings ($591 million) in value on its first day of New Year trading Wednesday, the Kenyan financial newspaper Business Daily Africa reported. And business leaders said that the government was losing around 2 billion Shillings ($29.5 million) a day in lost revenue as a result of the political violence, the paper reported. \"We do seem to be in a new place, there's a lot of uncertainty about where we go from here. And a lot depends crucially on how long-lasting this is,\" said Razia Kahn, an analyst specializing in Africa at Standard Chartered bank. Kenya has attracted a large number of multi-nationals and is home to one of the world's fastest growing stock exchanges. Its relative economic success has been helped in part by its thriving tourist sector, with visitors attracted by its abundant wildlife and pristine beaches. Provisional figures for 2006 from the Kenya's tourist board said the country had received 1.5 million visitors for the year, a growth of 5.2 per cent. However, fears that the tourist industry could take a heavy hit from the unrest grew with the British Federation of Tour Operators announcing Thursday it was suspending all holidays to the country departing up to and including this Saturday.  Watch an aid worker describe fears that crisis may resemble Rwanda's \u00bb . British tourists already in the country have been advised by the British Foreign Office to stay indoors and to stay away from the major cities. There are also worries about the knock-on effect for the region, since around 40 percent of Kenya's exports go to other African nations, Kahn said. Of even greater concern is the effect on Kenya's lucrative agriculture industry. Exports of tea, coffee, vegetables and flowers are big earners for the country, with agriculture making up about a fifth of the total economy. There have been media reports of tea and coffee auctions being halted by the violence as well as widespread disruption to transport routes as rioters blockade major roads across the country.

The Democratic Party has stripped the state of its delegates for moving up its primary date so early, and top-tier Democratic candidates have taken their names off the ballot, except for Sen. Hillary Clinton. The struggling auto industry has been a drag on Michigan's economy. In many ways, the Republican battle for Michigan will be similar to last week's New Hampshire contest. The primary is open, and any registered voter -- including independents and Democrats -- can participate. Sen. John McCain won New Hampshire with the help of independent voters, and he is campaigning hard to re-create that success in Michigan. In 2000, McCain defeated then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the Michigan primary. In that vote, more than half -- 52 percent -- were either independents or Democrats. Among Republican voters, McCain lost to Bush 29 percent to 66 percent. In that contest, almost three out of every 10 voters identified themselves as members of the religious right. Overall, Michigan is a swing state, producing narrow margins of victory for presidential candidates and statewide officeholders. However, voting trends favor the Democrats. Michigan's governor, Jennifer Granholm, is a Democrat, as are the state's two U.S. senators -- Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow. The Democratic presidential nominee has carried Michigan in the last four elections. Sen. John Kerry, the Democrats' 2004 standard bearer, won Michigan 51 percent to 48 percent over President Bush. The state's economy is powered by the automotive industry, which has experienced its fair share of struggles. Michigan's unemployment rate, 7.4 percent, is higher than the national average of 5 percent. Region by region . Wayne County, in the southeastern corner of the state, contains the economically depressed Detroit, Michigan's largest city. Detroit is predominantly black and solidly Democratic. North of Wayne County are the more-affluent suburban counties of Oakland and Macomb, which have grown in population in the last two decades. These two counties have been the state's central political battleground in recent elections. West of Wayne is the \"university belt,\" home to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Michigan State University in East Lansing. The area also includes the industrial cities of Saginaw and Flint, where unions remain strong, as well as Jackson and Bay City. The state's capital, Lansing, and the sparsely populated upper peninsula are also part of this region. The southwest part of the state is dominated by Grand Rapids, Michigan's second-largest city. Grand Rapids is traditionally Dutch-American and has many Christian conservatives and generally votes Republican. The area also contains smaller industrial cities and farming communities. The economy of the sparsely populated north and northwest is based on agriculture, tourism and timber. It traditionally votes Republican. Endorsements . The Detroit Free Press has endorsed McCain. \"While the Free Press differs with McCain on a number of issues, the Arizona senator is a smarter, more tested and pragmatic leader who has shown since 2000 that he knows how to build bipartisan alliances around issues,\" the newspaper said in an editorial. The Detroit News also endorsed McCain, citing his fiscal conservatism and command of military and foreign affairs, over Michigan native Mitt Romney. \"Other GOP contenders, most notably former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, are capable figures with impressive resumes and a solid grasp of the issues. But McCain's longtime presidential ambitions are at last aligned with the needs of the nation,\" the newspaper said.

With 95,000 volunteers and 5,000 employees, the Iraqi Red Crescent is the last line of defense for the country's poor, sick and displaced. They try to blend in as best they can, with Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds working in the neighborhoods distinct to their ethnicities. Six employees of the Iraqi Red Crescent have been killed over the last four years. Eight have been wounded, including six left disabled by the severity of their wounds. Hakki says the spike in numbers of abandoned children is especially alarming, the result of sectarian violence and drastic socio-economic problems. The majority of parents in Iraq, he says, leave their children with a single relative who often has about 20 to 30 children to look after. Some parents just leave their kids altogether. Many of the families are living in areas without basic needs, like water and electricity, and there are no jobs available. \"It's a desperate situation,\" he said. \"Children are becoming a liability for both the father and the mother.\" The greatest concern is the ripple effect it will have in the long term -- an entire generation lacking basic life skills, surviving with no education, no income and no families.  See wounded Iraqi children get help in neighboring Jordan \u00bb . \"The trauma of what's happening to those children is enormous,\" he said. \"If somebody is injured by a bullet or shrapnel, it takes a week or two and he's fine. ...

It's also negotiating with the U.S. Embassy, he said, to see if it can offer financial aid. But funds are low. Just recently, the group closed 18 camps for the winter and is trying to house those thousands of people in abandoned government buildings. At a waiting room at an Iraqi Red Crescent treatment center in Baghdad's Mansour district, CNN came across several young children in desperate need of care.

Baha, a 12-year-old boy, was waiting to see a doctor, recalling the exact date -- January 16, 2004 -- he lost his left eye. \"I want my eye to get well,\" he said. Baha was with his father in a market when someone opened fire on U.S. soldiers. When the soldiers fired back, shrapnel hit his eye. Despite what happened, this brave boy still goes to that same market. \"I'm not afraid,\" he said.

Yet, she couldn't see most of what was around her. She's blind in one eye and losing sight in the other -- the result of shoddy medical care. Her father, Dia'a, said he heard about the Iraqi Red Crescent from television and others who had been treated here. He said he can't afford to travel outside the country for medical treatment for his girl.

Hillary Clinton, then U.S. first lady, meets with Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan in 1995. In a campaign that had been drifting toward economic issues, the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto and the turmoil in Pakistan could refocus voters on who is best qualified to deal with crises in other parts of the world. \"My theme has been throughout this campaign that I am the one with experience, the knowledge and the judgment. So, perhaps it may serve to enhance those credentials,\" said Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. Locked inside a tough three-way battle for the Democratic nomination in Iowa, Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent a year calling herself the most experienced, most qualified candidate in the field. She stressed her ties with Bhutto and the tragedy of her death. \"This is one of the most important elections of our lifetime, and it certainly raises the stakes high for what we have to expect from our next president,\" the New York senator said.  Watch how the assassination is resonating on the campaign trail \u00bb . Sen. Barack Obama's camp, which has spent a year pushing back on criticisms that he lacks experience, insisted they welcome the renewed talks on foreign policy and called attention to Clinton's \"yes\" vote on the Iraq war. \"She was a strong supporter of the war in Iraq which we would submit is one of the reasons why we were diverted from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Al Qaeda, who may have been players in this event today. So that's a judgment she'll have to defend,\" said Obama adviser David Axelrod. The Clinton campaign said the suggestion that her vote caused unrest in Pakistan is baseless, adding that this is a time to focus on the people of Pakistan and not politics. When asked about Axelrod's remarks late Thursday, Obama told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that, \"This is one of those situations where Washington is putting a spin on it. ... He in no way was suggesting Hillary Clinton was somehow directly to blame for this situation.\" The Illinois senator added that \"it's important for us to not look at this in terms of short-term political points scoring.\"  Watch the showdown on foreign policy \u00bb . But the candidates all reacted, in part because of the gravity of the event, in part because they are just days away from the January 3 Iowa caucuses. Conversation quickly moved from condolences to campaign issues. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani talked terrorism, connecting the attack in Pakistan to the September 11, 2001, attacks. \"America feels a connection because of the attacks that took place here,\" he said. McCain, who along with Giuliani scores best on national security, bluntly challenged Giuliani's foreign policy experience.  Watch how the GOP candidates are reacting \u00bb . \"He did a great job post-9/11 in handling a post-crisis situation, but I don't know how that provides one the credentials to address national security issues,\" he said. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said he would call on Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf to step down. \"What is in U.S. interest is for there to be a stable, democratic Pakistan that is fighting terrorists. Right now, we have the worst of all worlds,\" he said Friday on CNN's \"American Morning.\" But Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson said calling for Musharraf to step down wouldn't be a good idea. \"I hope that we as candidates out here don't start lobbying these ideas that get plenty of attention but are not very sound,\" Thompson told CNN. Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards said he called Musharraf and \"urged him to continue this democratization process.\" Democratic hopeful Joe Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Bhutto's death was a \"genuine tragedy.\"  Watch how the Democrats are responding \u00bb . \"Ladies and gentleman, the stakes are incredibly high. They are incredibly high. If Pakistan falls into complete turmoil, martial law is declared again, you end up with a state that is being run by a dictator; ladies and gentleman that does not bode well for Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, India,\" he said. The shift in focus might not play out well for former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, whose foreign policy credentials have been under a microscope since he admitted to journalists that he was unaware of a major report on Iran's nuclear weapons program. He appeared to make another minor gaffe Thursday when he seemed to suggest incorrectly that Pakistan was currently under martial law. Later Thursday, Huckabee told CNN that \"it was not that I was unaware it was suspended, two weeks ago, lifted. ...The point was, would it be reinstated, would it be placed back in? All of the aspects of martial law have not been completely lifted even now. There's still a heavy hand Musharraf has used.\" If voters see a high-stakes drama in Pakistan, that could resonate at the polls. Most of the candidates said they didn't want to turn the assassination into a talking point, but it is just a week before the Iowa caucuses, and world events not only change the conversation -- they can change a campaign.

Lebanon's civil war was in full flood. One afternoon the shells began raining down on our neighborhood in Beirut. A Lebanese woman and her son run through west Beirut in 1989 during fighting between rival forces. We ran from school screaming. Forget the book bags, classmates, homework. Just run. Out of breath, my knees giving way, it seemed to take forever to reach our local shelter -- a dark humid room at the back of our apartment block. The memory of that terrifying afternoon receded -- until recently. After more than a decade of relative peace and reconstruction, the bombings and assassinations have returned to Beirut. Every time I hear of a new explosion, I think of a frightened child sitting in darkness. In 1988, I watched the last throes of Lebanon's civil war firsthand -- and like millions of Lebanese, sad, frustrated and often fearful.  See a timeline of Lebanon's recent history \u00bb . Now I watch from another continent, but I find those same emotions resurfacing. The conspiracies, the car bombs, the threatening rhetoric and political deadlock are eerily familiar. The actors are like shadows from a long gone past. They are grayer perhaps --  those who have avoided assassination. But the cast in Lebanon's tragedy has changed little in two decades. Then, as now, a presidential election is the setting, and the struggle where religion and clan play the main roles threatens to set Lebanon back 20 years.  See bios of Lebanon's major players \u00bb . In 1988, the president's term was coming to an end and the warring factions were unable to agree on a new candidate. Militias prevented parliament members from reaching the assembly building. Compromise was nowhere in sight. The West had abandoned Lebanon to the manipulation of its neighbors. Syria had its choice for president; Israel had its own allies -- a foil for growing Muslim radicalism. The country was awash with weapons. In his last act as president, Amin Gemayel named fellow Christian and Army Chief Michel Aoun as prime minister. At a stroke, he shattered the convention that a Muslim hold that position. Muslims refused to serve in the Cabinet and the country ended up with two governments. Aoun famously declared: \"I am prime minister and six ministers in one.\" Aoun's \"War of Liberation\" against Syria turned into defeat. Then, he turned on fellow Christians of the Lebanese Forces in the \"War of Elimination.\" When that failed, the Syrians drove Aoun to take refuge at the French Embassy. In August 1990, I came to CNN as a World Report panelist. I tried to explain Lebanon's chaos, the bewildering array of factions and the horrors of civil war for ordinary civilians. I had seen people killed in front of me; children orphaned in seconds, parents burying their infants in oversize white coffins. So when I was offered the opportunity to stay at CNN, I gratefully accepted the chance to escape the anarchy. But almost as I left, the civil war was being laid to rest. The various factions had fought each other to a standstill; Arab governments, supported by the West, helped negotiate a new constitutional framework overseen by Syrian influence. Peace came to Lebanon, but it would be five years before I returned. In 1995, I went back and was stunned. I kept looking around for checkpoints manned by militants. I couldn't believe that I could go anywhere without being harassed or kidnapped by one faction or another. No longer did identity -- Christian, Muslim or Druze -- define where Lebanese could go. People mixed freely in chic coffee shops and smoked the hubble-bubble, laughing at the same jokes. It was as if Lebanon's divisions had been wiped away by some magic eraser. Downtown Beirut, once rocked by explosions and pitted with bullet holes, was rocking to Lebanese pop music. The dusty sandbags had given way to boutiques carrying the latest European fashions and deluxe hotels. Lovers had returned to Beirut's Corniche, overlooking the Mediterranean, for romantic strolls at sunset. But the agreement that ended the civil war was more a truce than a real settlement -- and was overseen by a \"pax Syriana.\" As anti-Syrian sentiment grew, so did political tensions. On Valentine's Day 2005, the Corniche was once again rocked by an explosion.  Former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed. The symbolism left me speechless. On the day of love, Lebanon was thrown back into its most hateful history. It had been widely expected that Hariri would run for office again and demand the withdrawal of Syrian troops. Suspicion fell on Damascus, which vehemently denied involvement. On March 14, Martyrs' Square became a human sea of demonstrators: Muslims, Druze and Christians alike, demanding the \"truth.\" But Hariri's death also exposed the fault lines that had broken Lebanon a generation previously. Even after it withdrew its troops, Syria still had allies in Lebanon. One was Hezbollah, accused of the suicide attacks that had killed scores of U.S. Marines in Beirut more than 20 years previously. Another was Gen. Michel Aoun; now back from exile, the same Michel Aoun who had defied Syria in 1989, but who now made common cause with Hezbollah against his fellow Christians. Earlier this year I visited Martyrs' Square. The spirit of the Cedar Revolution had evaporated. The place looked like a morgue. Anti-government Hezbollah squatters had brought life there to a standstill. As I passed through, business owners stood silent in the sun and shook their heads at me in despair. I wondered if they sensed my disappointment, my pain at watching Beirut bleed again. Lebanon's political actors now find themselves re-enacting scenes from the final act of the civil war 19 years ago. Once again, the term of the president is approaching its end; there is no agreement on his successor. Suspicion and fear are the political currency of the day. And the questions haunts me: Will the country's brief renaissance that so amazed me in 1995 be snuffed out by the old curse of sectarian rivalries? E-mail to a friend .

Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, of Nevada is being sought as a suspect in the videotaped rape of a 3-year-old girl. Also Monday, Stiles' former girlfriend told CNN she believes she put him in contact with the girl. Tina Allen said she  is \"disgusted\" and \"mortified\" at her role in bringing them together. Nye County Sheriff Tony De Meo said Friday the girl has been found and is safe. He said the child's mother was cooperating with authorities. De Meo addressed Stiles directly: \"Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency. Understand this: Law enforcement not only has a long arm but a long memory. You will not be forgotten by members of this agency or any other law enforcement agency.\" Stiles' former girlfriend said she is stunned by the allegations.  Watch Allen describe her first impression of Stiles \u00bb . Allen said she and Stiles had been in an on-again, off-again relationship for 10 years and that he was good with her children. \"He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,\" Allen said. Allen took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her 3-year-old daughter, who allegedly was victimized by Stiles. \"I'm disgusted. I'm ashamed, embarrassed, mortified,\" Allen said. \"I regret every, every step I ever took; I feel bad for the baby.\" Todd Allen, Tina Allen's son, told CNN he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video. He said his mother and Stiles spent time together there. Todd Allen said nobody realized the child may have been abused. \"She's what you'd expect a little girl in elementary school to be like,\" he said. He said he never witnessed Stiles physically assault anyone. \"But I have seen him verbally and mentally assault many people,\" Todd Allen told CNN. Looking back, Tina Allen said there were some warning signs. She said Stiles hit her once but she didn't file a police report. She said she blames herself. \"How could I not know? Why couldn't I have recognized something? Why are all these people going through this torture now because of me?\" Allen asked. Allen ended her relationship with Stiles a few months ago. She said she believes it will be difficult for police to find him. \"He will hide out in mountains if that's what it takes, he will hide out in a crowd, he'll find somebody who hasn't heard anything and stay there,\" she said. \"He has skills. He knows how to hunt, I mean hunt with a gun, a knife, a bow.\" Allen said Stiles stopped by her house last week for a friendly visit before his name was linked to the videotape. She said his appearance had changed. She said his hair was longer and he had put on weight. Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, is a former animal trainer, authorities said. De Meo said the FBI also is seeking him in a separate matter involving state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under 14. The man who claimed to have found the tape in the desert and held it for at least five months before handing it over to authorities turned himself in Sunday to Nye County officials. Darren Tuck, a Nevada resident who allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces a possible sentence of 10 years to life for exhibiting pornography and another one to six years for possession of child pornography, according to De Meo.

The 50-minute tape -- titled \"An Invitation to Reflection and Repentance\" -- was released by As Sahab, al Qaeda's video production wing and was provided to CNN by www.LauraMansfield.com, a Web site that analyzes terrorism. In it, Gadahn renounces his citizenship to protest the imprisonment of Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman, a blind Egyptian Muslim leader serving a life sentence for his role in the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center; and John Walker Lindh, the American Taliban who was arrested in Afghanistan in 2001, and others.

Kennedy draft a speech addressing Kennedy's Catholicism and the separation between church and state. At the time, many questioned whether Kennedy, who would go on to become the nation's first Roman Catholic president, would be influenced by the Catholic church. Theodore Sorensen helped write John F. Kennedy's 1960 speech on Catholicism. Speaking to CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider, Sorensen discussed Kennedy's famous 1960 speech and compared it to the speech on faith in politics delivered Thursday by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who would be the first Mormon in the White House if he is elected. Question: Did Kennedy's 1960 speech win him the presidency? Sorensen: Well, he obviously didn't lose it, nor did he free the country from the curse of anti-Catholicism. The hate mail still poured into his office. The vicious picket signs were still seen out on the campaign trail, and, indeed, on Election Day. According to a University of Michigan survey, more people voted against Kennedy because of his religion than any other reason. Nevertheless, that speech, which was nationally broadcast and frequently rebroadcast, certainly took a lot of the poison out of the anti-Catholic issue and reassured all reasonable people.  Watch Sorensen discuss why Kennedy gave his speech \u00bb . Q. Could President Kennedy have delivered the speech Romney gave on Thursday? Sorensen: No. Mr. Romney's position on many of the issues are very different than JFK's. JFK wanted to particularly stress that he believed in the separation between church and state. He believed that no one needed to worry about a Catholic bishop or a cardinal dictating to him as a president, and that freedom of religion included freedom for those to go to any church or not to go to any church at all. So, Romney emphasized the role of religion in public life more strongly than JFK did or would have. Q. Romney seemed to differ quite strongly with Kennedy on the privacy of religion, didn't he? Sorensen: Yes, he did. In fact, Romney felt compelled for some reason to define his personal views of Jesus Christ. Kennedy said, as you noted, his personal views of religion were totally his business and not the business of the American people. Q. Romney made the statement \"freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom.\" Do you think Kennedy would have agreed with that? Sorensen: I don't think anyone would disagree strongly with that. There were some lines in the Romney speech that echoed the Kennedy speech. As an old speechwriter, I would congratulate Mr. Romney. It was a pretty good speech. I think he touched all the bases he wanted to touch. Q. Romney discussed his views of Jesus Christ, something that Kennedy avoided. Why did Kennedy avoid discussing his religious views? Sorensen: Because [Kennedy] began the speech by saying his private religious beliefs -- his relationship with God or Jesus Christ or anything else -- was not a matter of public discussion. He did not think the election should be based on -- as he said, it's not what kind of church I believe in, the question is what kind of country do I believe in. Q. Kennedy's speech in 1960 is widely viewed as being successful. Do you think Romney's speech is likely to be viewed as a success? Sorensen: I assume so. I don't think Mr. Romney should be denied the presidency because of his religion. Just as I don't think Senator [Barack] Obama should be denied because of his race. Or that Mrs. [Hillary] Clinton should be denied the presidency because of her gender. This country is in deep, serious trouble, and thoughtful citizens surely are going to make up their minds based on the major issues confronting the country and the major qualities of the candidates and not on such superficial tests as religion, race, or gender.

France's Nicolas Sarkoxy, left, welcomes Tony Blair and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas on Monday. Other delegations at the Paris meeting are offering aid in kind, such as the International Monetary Fund, which said it would provide monitoring of the Palestinians' promised reforms to reassure donors that their money would be used efficiently. Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad called the pledge of money a \"vote of confidence\" in the Palestinians. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the support of donors needed to be repaid in the coming months with steps to create a lasting settlement. \"Over the next few months, we have to show people our capability of making the difference on the ground,\" said Blair, who co-hosted the conference in his new role as envoy for the so-called Middle East Quartet of the United Nations, United States, European Union and Russia. The Paris conference focuses on short-term priorities for the Palestinians, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy said those include providing immediate support for the Palestinian people -- particularly those living in Gaza -- and stabilizing the Palestinian economy.  Watch CNN's Jim Bittermann explain the conference's aims \u00bb . It follows on the heels of last month's peace talks in the U.S. in which Israeli and Palestinian leaders vowed to negotiate a final-status agreement by the end of 2008. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said France would donate $300 million, and the United States was expected to pledge more than $500 million. Central to the Palestinians' request for aid is a three-year reform plan that the Palestinians prepared for the conference. The plan, which covers 2008 to 2010, centers on economic development and government reform. The World Bank praised the plan, calling it a \"promising effort\" to link policy-making, planning and budgeting. But in a report released Monday, the World Bank pointed out the reforms would succeed in helping Palestinians only if they were accompanied by both donor aid and Israeli actions. Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni spoke of taking such actions, saying Israel is committed to meeting its responsibilities under the Middle East road map, especially regarding the contentious issue of settlements. Livni said an agreement had been reached with the European Union to provide training for Palestinian police. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the Palestinians didn't lack will or determination but resources. He promised donors that Palestinians would work hard to create a modern country in control of its security. \"We are at a historic stage today, and the destiny of our region and peace depends on this,\" said Abbas, who requested the conference be held. Abbas earlier had requested $5.6 billion in aid over the next three years. Sarkozy repeatedly told the conference he is a \"friend of Israel,\" but he urged the Israeli government to withdraw troops from the West Bank, freeze settlements, reopen institutions in East Jerusalem and help the isolated population of Gaza. The World Bank's report detailed the challenges facing attempts to revive the Palestinian economy, which has become almost totally dependent on foreign aid. The Palestinian Authority is the largest employer for its people, as private-sector jobs dry up. The World Bank said wages for public sector employees account for almost half of the government's expenditures. With public investment having nearly ceased, the World Bank said, almost all government funds in the past two years have been used to pay salaries and cover operating costs. Staffing also has gone up in the health and education sectors, the World Bank said, leaving little money for pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, teaching and learning materials, and overall maintenance. The World Bank said the reforms would only succeed if they include Gaza, where 40 percent of the Palestinian population lives. Gaza has been subject to a wide-ranging crackdown since Hamas took power in June; its borders are closed, fuel imports are restricted, and there are strict limits on all imported goods. \"The continued entry of humanitarian goods has mitigated the impact of the closures on Gaza's population, but has not been sufficient to offset the collapse of the private sector there,\" the World Bank report said. Unemployment across the Palestinian territories stands at nearly 23 percent, the World Bank said, but in Gaza, 33 percent of the population is out of a job. It predicted the figures would rise if the restrictions continue. A report Monday from the U.N. Development Program spotlighted the pressures on private Palestinian businesses, especially in Gaza, where it said the private sector \"is on the verge of collapse with no scope for recovery\" unless Israeli restrictions are lifted.

He escaped and was sheltered in a Budapest safe house set up by Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who was credited with saving tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews during World War II. He arrived in the United States after being awarded an academic scholarship to study, according to his congressional Web site. He received bachelor's and master's degrees in economics from the University of Washington in Seattle and later earned a doctorate in economics from the University of California, Berkeley, the site said. As a lawmaker, Lantos was an outspoken human rights advocate. He supported the 2002 congressional resolution that authorized President Bush to launch the invasion of Iraq but later became an outspoken critic of the conflict.

Iraqis gather at the site of a car bomb in the city of Amara on Wednesday. The blasts detonated in close succession in a commercial area in the central section of Amara, the provincial capital of Maysan province and a city that has been the scene of fighting between rival Shiite factions. Baghdad was also hit by violence on Wednesday. A car bomb there killed five Iraqi civilians and wounded 15 others, an Interior Ministry official told CNN. The incident occurred in a Christian section of the largely Shiite New Baghdad district. Maj. Gen. Abdul Karim Khalaf, head of the Interior Ministry's National Command Center, confirmed the casualty figures in the Amara bombing. He and a committee were headed to Amara to investigate the incident. He said the ministry fired the city's police chief in the aftermath of the attack. Maysan Gov. Adil Muhawdar Radhi announced the vehicle ban, which he said will be in place through Thursday. He said additional security measures have been put in place in the city. The first bomb, in a car parked in a commercial area, detonated about 9:30 a.m. As onlookers gathered, the second one exploded in a nearby garage a few minutes later. It was followed by a third bomb in the garage a few minutes after that. Ambulances and police raced to the scene. News footage showed burning vehicles and black smoke, and the clothing of victims scattered beside pools of blood. Iraqi state television showed hospitals packed with people. Al-Forat, an Iraqi TV station affiliated with the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq political movement, reported that most of the casualties were women and children. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, in a statement, denounced the attack. \"The targeting of unarmed civilians today in the markets of Amara town by car bombs -- that is another ring in the chain of conspiracy against the Iraqi people that is aiming to destabilize the security and stability in this province,\" which he said endured cruelty under the Saddam Hussein regime. Maysan, which borders Iran, has been under Iraqi security control much of this year after control was transferred from the British military. It was not immediately known who was responsible for the blasts, but the violence is a reminder of the intense fighting between the Mehdi Army -- the militia of anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr -- and the Badr Brigade, the militia of the SICI, which condemned the bombings and blamed \"Saddamists and Takfiris.\" The two movements are bitter rivals and have been in the middle of local power struggles in Iraq's southern provinces and other Shiite areas.

Residents of the Mathare slum in Nairobi shout at demonstrators during violent clashes. But a booming tourism industry, impressive economic growth -- currently six percent a year according to The Economist -- and decades of peace in a region scarred by conflict have served to disguise widespread poverty, violent crime and corruption and simmering ethnic tensions. Tribal bonds remain stronger than national identity in Kenya, with the country's 36 million people claiming allegiance to around 40 different tribes. Last week's election pitched incumbent President Mwai Kibaki, a member of Kenya's largest Kikuyu tribe, against opposition leader Raila Odinga of the Luo tribe. The Kikuyu make up about 22 percent of Kenya's population. Mostly originating from Kenya's central highlands, the Kikuyu have long wielded strong economic and political power within the country. Kenya's first post-independence leader, Jomo Kenyatta, president from 1964 until 1978, was a Kikuyu. Kibaki, a government minister from 1965 until winning power as head of the Party of National Unity in elections five years ago, also enjoys the support of Kenyatta's successor, Daniel Arap Moi, a member of the Kalenjin tribe who ruled Kenya for 24 years from 1978 to 2002. The Luo make up around 13 percent of the population, mostly in the west of the country. But they also form a sizeable community in some of Nairobi's most notorious slums, such as the vast Kibera shantytown where Odinga enjoys strong support and where some of this week's fiercest violence has occurred. Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement is also backed by many members of the Luhya tribe, Kenya's second largest ethnic group, after Odinga promised to make a leading Luhya his deputy if elected. This week's violence came as election officials declared victory for Kibaki with 51.3 percent to 48.7 percent for Odinga in the closest presidential vote in Kenyan electoral history. But the result has been questioned by international election observers, throwing the country's political future into doubt. Kibaki's first election success in 2002 -- declared free and fair by international observers -- was hailed at the time as a step forward for Kenyan democracy. However, his term has been dogged by allegations of corruption and graft.

Irshad Manji is a controversial Muslim feminist and activist from Toronto, Canada. On each front, I take a different view. While far more liberal and democratic than Gen. Musharraf, Bhutto disappointed moderate, modern Pakistanis with her adherence to feudal politics. Writing to me through my Web site, American feminists say they are \"aching\" over the loss of \"our dear, sweet, brave Benazir.\" I understand the sentiment. But \"brave\" is not the word used by Pakistani women from whom I've also heard. They're hurting more over Bhutto's \"self-imposed\" conformity. \"She never realized her potential,\" a woman from Karachi tells me. \"And not because she was killed but because when she had the chance, she did not effectively challenge the backward mindset that has now led to her demise.\" For example, during Bhutto's time in office, Pakistan didn't defy the anti-female rape and adultery laws. Those notorious ordinances, known as Hudood, took their inspiration from tribal politics masquerading as Islam.  Watch Manji argue on CNN why Bhutto's legacy is mixed \u00bb . Imagine the opportunity: Bhutto could have championed a purer faith by tackling corrupt cultural practices. In so doing, she might have created allies among conservatives, who can be persuaded that although Islam is God-given, culture is man-made. Last year, a media campaign to strike down the Hudood Ordinances achieved this fine balance. But not because of her. And that, say many progressive Pakistanis, amputates Bhutto's legacy. The fact that cruel laws against women can be publicly debated at all should suggest that Pakistan has hope anyway. An exceptional leader can tap into it. History tells us so. There was a time when Pakistan's democratic politicians stuck it to the feudal fanatics. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was once heckled by a religious fundamentalist. \"You drink alcohol!\" shouted the critic. \"Yes,\" retorted the elder Bhutto, \"but I don't drink the blood of the people!\" His response captured the spirit of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan's founder. In 1947, Jinnah exuded high hopes for his people: \"You are free. You are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques, or to any other place of worship in the State of Pakistan. \"You may belong to any religion or caste or creed. That has nothing to do with the business of the state. We are starting with this fundamental principle that we are all citizens of one state... You will find that in due course of time, Hindus will cease to be Hindus and Muslims will cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense  ... but in the political sense as citizens of the state.\" Jinnah meant every word of his unconventional vision because he, himself, lived as a maverick. He adored his non-Muslim wife, and his sister often appeared with him on the campaign trail. Her visibility attested to Islam's embrace of women as partners of men. In the months ahead, the people of Pakistan will need to recall Jinnah's vision. It may be of comfort know that they're not alone. Countless Americans are now asking about their founders' intentions, desperate to re-discover the better angels of their country after eight years of George W. Bush. Still, Pakistan must avoid America's enduring mistake. The United States lapsed into profound divisiveness following the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. Many would argue that today's politics of polarization can be traced to the unresolved trauma of the King-Kennedy murders. For Pakistan, it's high time to transcend both trauma and tribalism. I pray that in death, Benazir Bhutto will be the catalyst for a deeper democracy than she ever advocated in life. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.

The case cast light on the treatment of women under Saudi Arabia's strict Islamic law. Al-Jazirah newspaper quoted a Saudi Justice Ministry official saying King Abdullah issued a royal pardon Monday -- the same day that the Hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, begins in Saudi Arabia. The victim's husband told CNN he has not received an official letter regarding her pardon, but considers it to be legitimate since it was announced in an official Saudi newspaper. He thanked King Abdullah for the pardon, saying: \"This fatherly care and noble gesture will help (in) lifting the emotional and psychological stress and suffering that our family has been enduring.\" \"This is not something new because we know that the King was always generous in dealing with his people and the entire world,\" the husband said. \"This week, we have two holidays to celebrate; the Eid and this great news of the pardon.\" Saudi sources told CNN that the king's pardon was not related to the beginning of the Hajj nor the Eid al-Adha festival that follows, which is normally when the Saudi monarch issues amnesty for prisoners. Watch how Arab media is reporting the story. \u00bb . Saudi Arabia's Justice Minister Abdullah Bin Mohammad al-Sheikh told al-Jazirah newspaper that the king felt the pardon would be in the best interests of the Saudi people, and the decision did not reflect any lack of confidence in the Saudi justice system. The White House welcomed King Abdullah's decision, but National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe stressed that \"this is obviously a matter for the Saudi Arabians and King Abdullah.\" A Saudi court ruled the 19-year-old had an \"illegitimate relationship\" with a man who was not her husband, and that she was raped after she and the man were discovered in a \"compromising situation, her clothes on the ground.\" The rape took place in Qatif in March 2006 when the woman was engaged to be married. The case has drawn international attention, provoked outrage in the West and cast light on the treatment of women under strict Islamic law in Saudi Arabia. The woman was meeting with a man -- described by the woman's attorney as a former friend from whom she was retrieving a photograph -- when they both were abducted last March. Seven men, convicted of abducting the pair and raping her, were sentenced from two to nine years in prison. Abdul Rahman al-Lahim, the lawyer who represented the woman, faced a disciplinary hearing for \"insulting the Supreme Judicial Council and disobeying the rules and regulations\" of the judiciary.  The hearing has been postponed. The woman's husband has been outspoken in his support for his wife. He called a Lebanese TV show to defend her, when a former Saudi judge claimed on the program that she \"spoil(ed) their marital bed\" by meeting an unrelated male \"in secret\" and admitted her guilt. Al-Lahim has said he hopes the case changes the Saudi justice system. \"We want to highlight the rape crimes in Saudi Arabia and the way they are handled and sentenced in court,\" he added. \"This is a new era for all of us.\" He said that the rape case had elicited a fierce response, including calls for his beheading. U.S. President George W. Bush said last week that King Abdullah \"knows our position loud and clear\" on the case.

Diana's former butler has given conflicting information at the enquiry into her death. The coroner said the information was already in the public domain and some of it was even mentioned in one of Paul Burrell's own books. Considered the first star witness of the inquest, Burrell's appearance Tuesday was delayed after the coroner asked him to retrieve the last letter the princess gave him. Monday, the ex-butler -- once described by the princess as \"her rock\" -- told the inquest the letter contained a \"secret,\" which he claimed he could not remember. After returning to London from his home in northern England Tuesday, Burrell said the letter was not there, but at his home in Florida. He then handed the coroner a note that he said contained the supposed secret. The coroner revealed that what Burrell referred to was that Diana was planning to buy property to live in part of the time and that the location may have been in the United States or South Africa. The coroner said the revelation is \"fairly and squarely in the public domain\" and that some of the information appeared in Burrell's book \"The Way We Were.\" Explaining the apparent discrepancies in his testimony, Burrell said he was confused by the cross-examination, which he described as \"horrid\" and \"disgraceful.\" The questioning of the former butler is expected to continue Wednesday. Diana and her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, died in a Paris tunnel in the early hours of August 31, 1997, along with their driver, Henri Paul. They had driven away from the Ritz Hotel in a black Mercedes with paparazzi chasing behind. There has been speculation that the couple had planned a big announcement the night they died. Photographers have testified they had heard rumors Diana would say she was getting engaged to Fayed or having a baby.  Watch report on claims about Diana's marriage plans \u00bb . Burrell did not take the stand until Tuesday afternoon. Earlier in the day, the inquest heard from Diana's former lawyer, who said the princess had claimed Queen Elizabeth was planning to abdicate in April 1996 and allow Prince Charles to be king. Maggie Rae said at the inquest that Diana also believed there was a plot to seriously injure her in an accident. Rae said the claims came at a meeting with her legal team at Kensington Palace in which the princess also made clear her belief that the succession of the English crown should skip a generation to her son, William. The morning's evidence also heard that Britain's top police officer had advised the queen against allowing Diana to go on holiday with Mohamed al Fayed, the father of Dodi. In a note from Chief Superintendent Dai Davies, head of the Royal Protection Squad, that was read out to the court, it was stated that he and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon believed that the planned holiday was \"unwise.\" Al Fayed -- a successful businessman and owner of the London luxury store Harrods -- was considered a controversial figure at the time. Diana defied the advice and went on the trip. It was during this holiday on the tycoon's luxury yacht in the French resort of St. Tropez that she met Dodi Fayed. During her testimony, Rae also gave an insight into the princess's lifestyle, which she described as \"odd\" and \"lonely.\" She said she did not believe Diana's claims of a conspiracy against her. \"I remember one occasion when she told me about her weekend and she had been alone in those rather silent set of apartments. She had heated her own food in the microwave,\" Rae told the court. \"I thought she lived in a very odd environment. I thought she was quite lonely.\" E-mail to a friend .

Diana once referred to her former butler Paul Burrell as \"my rock.\" Burrell, who returned to Britain from his home in Florida to give evidence, was the first star witness of the London inquest, now in its fourth month. His role as confidant to Diana, who died in a Paris car crash on August 31, 1997, along with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed and hotel security chief Henri Paul, meant his testimony was eagerly anticipated. Burrell, whom the late princess once called \"my rock,\" cast doubt on whether Diana was ready to marry Fayed. According to Burrell, the princess was still \"holding a candle\" for former boyfriend and heart surgeon Hasnat Khan -- who she called \"her soulmate\" -- when she started dating Fayed \"on the rebound.\" Burrell told the inquest that Diana asked him to listen in on a conversation in June 1997 with her mother, Frances Shand Kydd, who died in 2004 and who was critical of her relationship with Muslim men.  \"She called the princess a 'whore' and she said that she was messing around with 'effing Muslim men' and she was 'disgraceful' and said some very nasty things,\" Burrell said. He agreed that, as a result of such calls Diana, decided not to talk to her mother again. The inquest, which began in October and is expected to last another two or three months, aims to uncover the facts surrounding the deaths of the Princess and Dodi and determine their cause of death -- whether by accident or otherwise. Asked earlier in the day if he believed that Fayed was \"the one,\" Burrell said \"no, I did not have that impression.\" He also cast doubt on claims that Fayed and Diana were engaged or on the cusp of engagement, saying: \"I find that difficult to believe.\" Asked to explain himself, Burrell said: \"Because this was only a 30-day relationship and the princess had just finished a long-term relationship with someone (Khan) she cared deeply about. I knew that because I was there and I saw it.\" Diana's 18-month relationship with Khan ended around the same time she started seeing Fayed in July 1997. Burrell said Diana had asked him at one point to investigate how a private wedding with Khan might take place, given that Khan is Muslim.  Watch report on claims about Diana's marriage plans. \u00bb . Khan had not proposed to the princess, Burrell said, adding that Khan was \"the man she loved more than any other.\" He said he spoke to Diana about the possibility that Fayed would give her a ring shortly before her death. Burrell said he suggested to the princess that she wear it on the fourth finger of her right hand, rather than the left, as is customary with engagement rings. \"I need marriage like a bad rash,\" Burrell claimed Diana told him. Last month at the inquest Lady Annabel Goldsmith, a friend of Diana, said the princess had remarked that she needed another marriage \"like a rash on my face.\" Burrell also indicated that the ring was not an engagement ring, as the Fayed family has maintained. Fayed family spokesman Michael Cole testified last week that Dodi's father, Mohamed Al Fayed, was certain the couple had planned to marry. Lawyers at the inquest asked Burrell whether he knew whether a special announcement had been planned for the Monday following the fatal car crash. There has been speculation the couple planned to announce special news, such as an engagement. But Burrell said he knew nothing of such a plan. He said he had actually looked at Diana's schedule for that day and found only mundane items, and nothing to indicate she planned a special announcement. Burrell also told the inquest he did not believe Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth's, husband was involved in Diana's death. Mohamed Al Fayed, father of Dodi and the owner of Harrods department store, has long claimed that senior members of the royal family -- specifically the queen's husband, Prince Philip -- ordered the pair be murdered. He also claims that Diana was pregnant at the time of her death. But Burrell said that he knew Prince Philip very well and that he could not have been behind the deaths. \"I can tell you that is not Prince Philip's nature, \" he said. \"Plus the princess was the mother of his grandchildren. Why would he want to harm her? It's not possible.\" The inquest has seen and heard about correspondence which Prince Philip sent to Diana, with some witnesses claiming that he wrote cruel and hurtful letters. But other correspondence shown to the jury appeared to be friendly and was affectionately signed, \"Pa.\" Burrell explained that Philip could sometimes come across as terse because he says what he thinks. \"Prince Philip doesn't mix his words,\" Burrell said. \"He says it as it is, but he is not a nasty man. Prince Philip isn't known for his diplomacy. He was fond of the princess.\" Burrell worked for the British royals for 21 years and became close to Diana after her separation from Prince Charles. He has written two books about his time with the princess. In his second book, Burrell told of a letter from Diana which indicated she feared for her life. The princess wrote that Prince Charles planned \"'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury.\" One of Diana's close friends, however, testified last month that she believed the letter could have been forged. Lucia Flecha de Lima said on December 18 that Burrell was capable of imitating the princess's handwriting. Lawyers questioned Burrell about the date of the letter. Burrell said it was written in October 1996, two months, after Diana and Charles divorced -- yet the letter refers to Charles as \"my husband.\" Burrell responded that Diana always referred to Charles that way, even after the divorce. The inquest has revealed that Diana was a prolific letter-writer who also received a lot of correspondence. Witnesses, including Burrell, recall that the princess kept the letters in her desk, with the more important ones stored in a special box. Burrell testified that after Diana's death, her mother, Frances Shand-Kidd, worked every day for a week shredding the papers from Diana's desk. He said he expressed concern about the shredding during a meeting he had with the queen on December 19, 1997. It was at this meeting that Queen Elizabeth told Burrell: \"There are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge.\" That comment, which has been widely reported, was meant to warn him to be careful, Burrell said, and was not a warning about any one person or group of people. At the same meeting Burrell also told the queen that he had taken some of Diana's belongings to keep safe. The details of the conversation emerged when Burrell stood trial for their alleged theft in 2002, causing the case against him to collapse. E-mail to a friend .

Top Italian player Potito Starace has been suspended for six weeks for betting on matches. The country's top player Starace -- 31st in the ATP rankings -- has been suspended for six weeks from January 1 and fined $30,000 (20,890 euros) for making five bets totalling around 90 euros two years ago. Bracciali, world ranked 258, has been banned for three months and fined $20,000 (13,930 euros) for making around 50 five-euro bets between 2004 and 2005. The Italian Tennis Federation (FIT) confirmed the news on its website, www.federtennis.it. However, they denounced the penalties as disproportionate, saying the players never bet on their own matches. \"Injustice is done,\" the statement said. \"These penalties are absolutely, excessively severe compared to the magnitude of the violations carried out by the two players.\" The federation said the two were not aware of the ATP's betting regulations, and that they stopped placing the bets as soon as they learned it was against the rules. Another Italian player, Alessio Di Mauro, became the first player sanctioned under the ATP's new anti-corruption rules when he received a nine-month ban in November, also for betting on matches. Starace and Bracciali said they were scapegoats for a larger match-fixing scandal.\"It's disgusting,\" said the 26-year-old Starace. \"The ATP doesn't know where to turn. It's all a joke.\" Bracciali said the two had been \"sacrificed.\" \"That's why they came after us,\" the 29-year-old said. \"We are not champions and we don't count in the upper echelons.\" ATP officials could not be reached for comment on Saturday. Concerns about match-fixing have risen since August, when an online betting company reported unusual betting patterns during a match between fourth-ranked Nikolay Davydenko of Russia and Martin Vassallo Arguello of Argentina. The company, Betfair, voided all bets and the ATP has been investigating. Davydenko, who retired while trailing in the third set, denies wrongdoing. Since then, several players have said that they had been approached with offers to fix matches in exchange for money.

Bodyguard Trevor Rees and the back of Princess Diana's head are seen shortly before the car crash. Bodyguard Trevor Rees, formerly known as Trevor Rees-Jones, was the front-seat passenger in the Mercedes that carried Diana, her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul. He sustained serious injuries in the August 31, 1997 crash and testified that he received anonymous phone calls and letters after the accident, threatening him to keep quiet. He said the caller told him to keep quiet, saying, \"We know who you are, we know where you are, and we know where you live.\" Rees said he didn't take the calls or letters seriously. A lawyer also asked Rees about a supposed encounter with a woman in which he told her, \"If I remember, they're going to kill me.\" Rees said he didn't recall the conversation and found it unlikely he ever made the remark. Rees, who still has a visible scar from the accident over his left eye, told the court he remembers nothing new about the crash, which, he has said, was an accident. He has said the last thing he remembers that night was leaving the Ritz Hotel in Paris, and that his next memory is more than a week later, in his hospital bed, when his parents told him everyone else in the car was dead. Rees suffered major injuries to his lower jaw, the base of his brain, and his pulmonary system and has had several surgeries and hospitalizations, some of which al Fayed paid for. Rees also testified that he did not support the allegations by Dodi Fayed's father, Mohamed al Fayed, that British security services were behind the crash. He denied the security services paid him to change his story. At the time of the crash, Rees was working for al Fayed's security team and was assigned to guard Dodi Fayed. He was also protecting the princess because she was Fayed's companion on the trip. He no longer works on al Fayed's security team. Rees has said what was once a good relationship with his former employer has broken down, largely because he does into support al Fayed's conspiracy theories about the crash. \"I am not a part of any conspiracy to suppress the truth at all,\" Rees testified. \"All I have ever done is given the truth as I see it.\" In 2000, Rees published a book, \"The Bodyguard's Story: Diana, the Crash, and the Sole Survivor,\" offering his account of the events surrounding the crash. He said al Fayed tried unsuccessfully to stop the book's publication in England. Rees told CNN he wrote the book to give a definitive account of what he remembered and knew, but also to counter al Fayed's accusations that his unprofessionalism caused the accident. Rees also said proceeds from the book helped pay his legal bills. During the morning session, Rees testified that he had two flashbacks in the months after the crash, but his psychiatrist told him they were false memories. In the first, Rees said, he recalled hearing the voice of a woman -- apparently Diana -- calling out, \"Dodi\" from the back seat of the car. In the second flashback, Rees said he recalled seeing a paparazzi motorbike next to the car. Lawyer Ian Burnett then read from a letter written by Al Fayed to Lord Stevens, who investigated the crash for the British police. In the letter, Al Fayed says Rees is lying about losing his memory. \"He knows the detail which the security services are so eager to suppress,\" Al Fayed wrote, alluding to his belief that the crash was part of a murder plot. Rees testified that he was not lying about his memory loss: \"I have no memory of -- after leaving the back of the hotel, that's my last true memory.\" Rees also said claims the couple visited a jeweler's in Monte Carlo to buy an engagement ring in late August 1997 were untrue. British authorities hold an inquest whenever someone dies in suspicious circumstances. A judge, who is also called a coroner, holds hearings to determine how the person died, but he will not determine blame or apportion guilt. Although Diana and Dodi Fayed died in Paris, a British coroner must still investigate because their bodies were returned to Britain. The inquest does not involve driver Henri Paul because his body remained in France. British authorities had to wait to begin the inquest until after French authorities concluded their investigation, which lasted from August 1997 to late 2003. The inquest then began but immediately adjourned so that British police could do their own report, which was needed for the British inquest. The British police inquiry took almost three years and concluded in December 2006. The inquest then resumed in October 2007 and is expected to last four to six months. E-mail to a friend .

Lexi and Joshua Dominguez exit a helicopter Wednesday, shortly after being found. The four sought shelter from the heavy snow in a culvert and removed their sodden socks in an effort to stay warm and dry while they waited for rescue, the pilots said. Frederick Dominguez said that during the three-day ordeal, he and his children slept inside a log for warmth and ripped apart their shirts to wrap their wet, freezing feet. \"You just go to survival mode,\" he said. \"Every parent would do that. You would do anything, sacrifice yourself, because these are your kids.\" Dominguez and his children -- Christopher, 18; Lexi, 14; and Joshua, 12 -- were reported missing Monday night by Dominguez's former wife and the children's mother, Lisa Sams, according to police in Paradise, California, a town of 27,000 people about 90 miles north of Sacramento.  Watch the family talk about their \"scary\" ordeal \u00bb . \"I'm glad I'm home. Praise God,\" Dominguez told reporters after exiting a chopper at the search command post. \"It was awful.\" Asked how he survived, he replied, \"Jesus Christ.\" Dominguez said he used branches and sticks to spell out the word \"Help\" near the culvert, where the three slept the last two nights -- at times sleeping with their feet inside each other's shirts to help stave off frostbite. He said his daughter was the first to hear a California Highway Patrol helicopter overhead. He said he ran though several feet of snow barefooted to wave it down. \"When they turned around, man, I was just praising God and saying, 'Thank you Lord, thank you Lord,' because I knew we had made it,\" he said. Police vehicles equipped with snow chains rumbled up mountain roads to help conduct the search, which also involved a snowmobile and dogs. More than 80 searchers scoured the woods Wednesday until the four were found about 1 p.m. (4 p.m. ET). Officer Steve Ward said he was piloting the helicopter out ahead of bad weather when he spotted Dominguez coming out of the culvert and waving. \"We were very lucky that we just saw this guy at the last second.\" Paramedic Flight Officer Dave White, who was with Ward, said that after the two shut down the helicopter and waved the family over, all four came running. \"The little girl was in tears,\" he said. White said the family was found north of where ground crews were searching. The pilots could see the \"Help\" sign they had made with twigs on a nearby four-wheel-drive road, he said. Christopher Dominguez told CNN's Anderson Cooper the family got lost Sunday searching for a tree, which they had chopped down but later abandoned. He said they didn't have food, heavy coats or other provisions to help prepare for the cold nights. \"We weren't prepared at all,\" he said. \"We just thought we were going to go up to the mountains, get our tree and go back home. It didn't turn out that way.\" After the family failed to locate their vehicle, he said, snow and darkness began to fall. At that point, Lexi Dominguez said, \"I started freaking out.\" \"It was really, really scary,\" she said. \"I just remember walking and walking and being like, we're not going to make it,\" Lexi said. And as they huddled for warmth, Christopher Dominguez said, his sister sang songs to help pass the time until help arrived. \"We were all just happy, happy to be rescued,\" Christopher Dominguez said late Wednesday, huddled with his siblings under blankets in their home. \"I feel good, just happy to be home,\" said Joshua Dominguez. \"Because I didn't think we were going to make it.\" All four appeared to be in good condition as they were brought by chopper to the command post and taken to ambulances. Wendy Wilson, the children's aunt, told CNN the two younger children had some frostbite on their toes and a touch of hypothermia, but were expected to make a full recovery. Butte County Search and Rescue dispatcher Madde Watts said, \"They had angels with them, for sure.\" The search riveted those in Paradise and beyond. Mayor Alan White, whose son played soccer on the same team as Joshua last year, said he and many others in and around Paradise have cut Christmas trees in the same place where the family vanished. When winter weather sours there, he said, people in the woods can get lost quickly. \"If you're 50 feet from your car, you might not be able to find it,\" he said. Although police found the family's car, it offered no clues as to where they might have gone. The inaccessible area is beyond the reach of cell phones, authorities have said. Paradise High principal Mike Lerch said students had volunteered to help in the search. \"This is a good family,\" he said. Christopher Dominguez had graduated from the school a few months ago, Lerch said, and Lexi is a sophomore there. Joshua attends Paradise Intermediate School.

Actors Daniel Day-Lewis, Tilda Swinton, Marion Cotillard and Javier Bardem toast their success. \"No Country,\" the Coen brothers' brutal tale of a man pursued by death and the law across the bleak moonscapes of West Texas, won best picture at the 80th Academy Awards. The four acting awards, meanwhile, went to Europeans: Marion Cotillard, Daniel Day-Lewis, Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton. The Coens also won best director and best adapted screenplay, and Bardem, who played cattle-gun-armed killer Anton Chigurh, won best supporting actor. Producer Scott Rudin shared the best picture award with the brothers. \"We're very thankful to all of you out there for letting us continue to play in our corner of the sandbox, so thank you very much,\" Joel Coen said in accepting the directing award. He observed that the pair didn't think they were doing much different work now from when, as a child, Ethan Coen \"got a suit and a briefcase and we went to the Minneapolis International Airport with a Super 8 camera and made a movie about shuttle diplomacy called 'Henry Kissinger, Man on the Go.' \"  Watch the best of the winners' backstage remarks \u00bb . The Coens, who have been known for their arch style and oddball humor in films such as \"Fargo,\" \"O Brother, Where Art Thou\" and \"The Big Lebowski,\" received some laughs for Ethan Coen's laconic acceptance speeches. After the pair won for adapted screenplay, Ethan Coen gave a brief thanks. Upon winning the directing award, he expanded on his speech slightly, sort of: \"I don't have a lot to add to what I said earlier. Thank you,\" he said. Day-Lewis was more effusive in his thanks after winning best actor for his performance as a misanthropic oilman in \"There Will Be Blood.\" \"My deepest thanks to the members of the Academy for whacking me with the handsomest bludgeon in town,\" the British actor said as he accepted the award. \"I've been thinking a lot about fathers and sons in the course of this, and I'd like to accept this in the memory of my grandfather, Michael Balcon, my father, Cecil Day-Lewis, and my three fine boys, Gabriel, Ronan and Cashel,\" he added. See the complete list of winners . As he accepted his first Oscar, Bardem, one of Spain's top actors, thanked his directors and reflected on his role as a creepy killer with a bad haircut. \"Thank you to the Coens for being crazy enough to think that I could do that, and to put one of the most horrible haircuts in history over my head,\" he said.  Watch \"No Country\" win best picture \u00bb . It was his second career nomination. His other came for \"Before Night Falls\" (2000), in which he played Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas. In a mild surprise, French actress Cotillard won her first Academy Award for her portrayal of singer Edith Piaf in \"La Vie en Rose.\" Early handicappers had bet heavily on veteran Julie Christie, a previous Oscar winner who played a woman falling victim to Alzheimer's in \"Away from Her.\" But Cotillard, who's received raves for her performance as the French singer, had been considered a strong contender for best actress. \"I'm speechless now ... I ... I ... thank you life, thank you love,\" Cotillard exclaimed. \"And it is true, there are some angels in this city. Thank you so, so much!\" The actress has appeared in dozens of films in her native France, but she may be most recognizable to American audiences for her performances in \"A Very Long Engagement\" (2004) and \"Big Fish\" (2003). In a highly competitive race, Swinton nabbed the best supporting actress Oscar for her portrayal as lawyer Karen Crowder in the legal drama \"Michael Clayton.\" \"I have an American agent who is the spitting image of this. Really, truly, the same shape head and, it has to be said, the buttocks,\" the British actress said, examining her new Oscar. \"And I'm giving this to him because there's no way I'd be in America at all, ever, on a plane if it wasn't for him.\"  See Swinton on the red carpet \u00bb . Swinton beat out 83-year-old Ruby Dee, who had been considered a sentimental favorite for her first Oscar nomination in the supporting actress category, playing Mama Lucas to Denzel Washington's drug kingpin Frank Lucas in \"American Gangster.\" Swinton also beat Cate Blanchett (as a mid-'60s take on Bob Dylan in \"I'm Not There\") and Amy Ryan (a difficult working-class mother in \"Gone Baby Gone\"). The Academy Awards opened with host Jon Stewart joking about the recently ended writers strike -- which forced a cutback in the Golden Globes and threatened the Oscars as well -- and commenting on the bleakness of the best picture nominees. \"Tonight we look beyond the dark days to focus on happier fare: This year's slate of Oscar-nominated psychopathic killer movies,\" Stewart joked. \"Does this town need a hug? What happened? 'No Country For Old Men,' 'Sweeney Todd,' 'There Will Be Blood'? All I can say is, thank God for [the comedy \"Juno's\"] teen pregnancy. I think the country agrees.\"  Check out Oscar prep photos \u00bb . \"Juno\" has been the little movie that could all season. The film, which cost a relatively paltry $7.5 million, was the only best picture nominee to top $100 million at the box office, ensuring it a rooting interest from moviegoers. Star Ellen Page received plaudits for her performance as the title character, and screenwriter Diablo Cody -- famously a former stripper -- has become one of Hollywood's \"it\" scribes. Cody won best original screenplay. \"This is for the writers. I want to thank all the writers. I especially want to thank my fellow nominees because I worship you guys and I'm learning from you every day,\" Cody said. The first award of the evening, for costume design, went to \"Elizabeth: The Golden Age.\" The best animated feature went to \"Ratatouille,\" a computer-animated Pixar film directed and written by Oscar winner Brad Bird (\"The Incredibles\"). The rat-turns-chef movie beat out \"Persepolis,\" based on the graphic novel by Marjane Satrapi, and \"Surf's Up,\" a computer-animated film about penguins. \"The Counterfeiters\" from Austria took the best foreign-language film. The movie is based on a true story about a counterfeiter who, after being sent to a concentration camp, was employed by the Nazis to fake other countries' currency. Best original song was awarded to \"Falling Slowly\" from \"Once.\" It beat out three songs from \"Enchanted,\" the Disney film about an animated princess come to life. The Oscars were spread around. \"No Country\" picked up four, \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" earned three (one for its rapid-fire editing) and \"There Will Be Blood\" received two: Day-Lewis' acting award and Robert Elswit's cinematography honor. But nobody had any doubt what film was considered the evening's big winner. \"There's nothing like it, and especially with these two guys,\" producer Rudin said backstage with the Coens of their unusual Western. \"I'm incredibly proud, and I think it's the best movie we have been involved with.

An American Airlines passenger complaining that she was having trouble breathing died on a flight last week. Jill Drake, a marketing representative for MedAire, Inc., said its physicians last year advised 74 airlines on how to handle more than 17,000 in-flight medical events. Flight attendants with sick passengers call Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, a level-one trauma center where emergency room physicians and a service able to translate 140 languages are on call to answer questions from any of 2 million airline passengers flying at any given time, she said. \"Very rarely\" does the call result in a diversion, a decision made not by the doctor but by the pilot who must consider a number of variables beyond the passenger's health, she said. The pilot must weigh weather conditions, remaining fuel and proximity to an airport. As of 1 p.m. (3 p.m. ET) Monday, MedAire had fielded 110 calls, \"which is a very busy day for us,\" she said. On average, the company gets about 50 in-flight calls from commercial airliners for an entire day, and an additional 25 or 30 calls related to events that occur at airport gates or aboard yachts and commercial ships, she said. Airlines contracting with MedAire include Continental, Southwest and British Airways. American has its own in-house medical team. Drake said MedAire's doctors documented 97 onboard deaths in 2007, down from 110 in 2006. The top categories of in-flight illness are fainting, gastrointestinal problems, respiratory issues such as shortness of breath, heart problems ranging from arrhythmias to arrest and orthopedic problems, such as broken bones, Drake said. By law, U.S.-based commercial airlines must carry automatic external defibrillators, oxygen and medical kits. Some airlines choose to carry extra, non-mandated medications. If a passenger already has breathing problems, airplane travel will only worsen the condition because cabins are typically pressurized at 8,000 feet, said Drake. Her advice to anyone not feeling 100 percent: \"Do not travel.\" And anyone with a medical condition who travels should pack any critical medications in a carry-on bag, she said. Though flight attendants are trained to handle on-board emergencies, \"they are not medically trained,\" she said. \"To think that they are going to be able to assist your every need, that's quite a high expectation.\" Hydration and moderation are key, and passengers should carry water and a snack, she said. Vacationers often return home from tropical locales sunburned and, in some cases, drunk. \"Altitude amplifies the buzz,\" Drake said. \"You have a couple of cocktails in Denver, you feel it a little bit more than in Omaha.\" Denver's altitude is 5,280 feet; Omaha's is 1,040 feet. Flying in a fresh cast can also prove dangerous. \"Your arm could expand and it could cut off your circulation,\" she said, noting that the risk is reduced with older casts, which have typically already expanded to accommodate any swelling. Though the FAA began demanding that airlines carry certain medications more than 30 years ago, the list was tiny. During the 1990s, overseas airlines began carrying more sophisticated equipment, and pressure increased for U.S.-based airlines to follow, said Dr. Russell Rayman, executive director of the Aerospace Medical Association, which has roughly 3,000 members including physicians, research scientists and flight nurses. Congress held hearings and then required airlines carry more robust kits and defibrillators by 2004. American Airlines was among the first to do so, said Dr. David McKenas, who served for 10 years as the airline's corporate medical director until 2002. He lauded the defibrillator as \"so good it's like 100 cardiologists in a box.\" The machine will only work if the patient's heart is fibrillating, a condition where the contractions become so irregular it loses its ability to pump blood efficiently. American Airlines buys its kits from Banyan International Corp., which describes itself as \"the nation's leading provider of emergency medical kits.\" Each of the nine-pound, $250 kits includes aspirin, alcohol swabs, nitroglycerine tablets, antihistamines, IV tubing, a stethoscope, a blood-pressure gauge, a bronchodilator, syringes, gloves, saline solution, epinephrine, dextrose, a manual resuscitation bag, alcohol pads and shears. Oxygen comes in several forms aboard planes. The oxygen that flows into masks stored above individual seats is not medical oxygen and would not suffice for a passenger in an in-flight medical emergency, said Rayman. Flight attendants have portable bottles of oxygen that they are to use for themselves in the event of a cabin decompression. \"It could be used if there is a medical emergency on board, but that's not its purpose,\" he said. More oxygen is stored in the cockpit for the pilots. Though MedAire keeps track of its clients' medical air incidents, Rayman criticized the FAA's failure to do so. \"There is no central repository where these things can be archived and then retrieved,\" he said. \"They don't want to report it because it just doesn't look good. It's not good P.R., you could say.\" He said even an anonymous registry would serve a useful purpose. \"We're concerned for safety on the flight,\" FAA spokeswoman Alison Duquette said. \"Once someone leaves the aviation system, there is no way for us to track the outcome.\" E-mail to a friend .", "b531a8ba685e8d461d0a491f35c9970c3dddf3dd": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Bush on Wednesday signed a sweeping energy bill that he said would help the country become \"stronger, cleaner and more secure.\" President Bush on Wednesday signs a bill raising auto fuel economy standards for the first time in decades. The bill -- approved overwhelmingly Tuesday by the House of Representatives -- raises automotive fuel economy standards for the first time in more than three decades, requiring a corporate average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020. It also boosts federal support for alternative fuel research and energy conservation efforts. A Republican filibuster in the Senate removed provisions that Bush objected to that would have eliminated tax breaks for oil companies and a requirement that electric utilities produce a portion of their power from alternative sources. The current fuel-economy standards of 27.5 miles per gallon for passenger cars and 22.2 for light trucks were established in 1975. The new bill sets a single average standard for manufacturers. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Tuesday's bill was \"a great, wonderful first step for an energy revolution that starts in America and ripples throughout the world.\" But Reid said Democrats would continue pushing to shift federal tax breaks away from fossil-fuel producers and into renewable energy research -- one of the party's top priorities when it took control of Congress in January. House opponents such as Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, complained that the bill will undo many of the efforts made to foster increased production of fossil fuels in an energy bill passed in 2005. \"I understand the consequences of elections. I understand there's a new majority,\" said Barton, the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. \"I do not understand how what made sense two years ago doesn't make sense today.\" Barton called the legislation a \"no-energy\" bill and \"a recipe for recession,\" arguing its mandated conservation measures would raise prices for fuel, homes and appliances for consumers.

On Friday, he announced plans to visit sub-Saharan Africa early next year to see the program at work. He renewed his call for lawmakers to continue funding it. \"Now the time has come for the United States Congress to act again,\" he said. \"I'm confident they will.\" The White House says the program -- which targets countries hardest-hit by the disease -- has treated more than 1.3 million people with AIDS. Increased funding would boost that number to 2.5 million, while expanding AIDS prevention programs and offering care to millions more with AIDS. Despite some successes, the program has been criticized for requiring that participating groups emphasize abstinence education. At the White House, about 40 people carried signs in support of more AIDS funding. Before speaking, the president, along with First lady Laura Bush, participated in an hourlong faith-based roundtable discussion at the church. Among others, the president met with Martha Chilufya, founder of the Mututa Memorial Center in Zambia. The center works with faith-based and other caregivers to serve more than 150 patients. Laura Bush and daughter Jenna visited the center in June. Bush said the first lady will join him on his trip next year.

The court sent the parental custody dispute back to the trial court \"to resolve the factual issue whether M agrees or objects to the circumcision.\" \"M\" is the child at the center of a long-running custody dispute between James and Lia Boldt, who divorced in 1999. Soon after, the father began studying Judaism and later converted. He also started teaching his son about the faith. By then, James had parental custody and told his ex-wife the boy would convert as well, and that to do so, he would have to have the circumcision procedure. The mother objected, saying the child had been raised in the Russian Orthodox faith while the couple was married. Because the two sides disagreed, and were living in neighboring states, the conflict dissolved into ongoing personal and constitutional dispute. James Boldt said that as a Jew and the primary caregiver, he has a First Amendment right to practice his faith as he sees fit for his child. Lia Boldt countered her son does not want to go through with the circumcision, and that it is an invasive, irreversible, and potentially dangerous medical procedure. The state high court seemed especially reluctant to address the issue, saying normally such disputes \"are considered private family matters.\" But the justices noted \"these parties cannot or will not resolve this matter without resort to the courts.\" So rather than offer a definitive ruling, the justices ordered both sides to go to the actual source of the conflict. \"In our view, at age 12, M's attitude regarding circumcision, though not conclusive of the custody issue presented here, is a fact necessary to the determination\" of whether the mother can press her objections to the procedure, wrote Chief Justice Paul De Muniz for the six-member panel. \"Forcing M at age 12 to undergo circumcision against his will could seriously affect the relationship between M and his father, and could have a pronounced effect on father's capability to properly care for M.\" There was no initial reaction to the decision from the parents or their attorneys.

They're charged with conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine and with carrying firearms in connection with that conspiracy. U.S. Magistrate Judge Alan Baverman ordered them held in custody until a preliminary hearing Wednesday. Another Ranger, Randy Spivey, 32, is scheduled to appear in court Monday. \"It is a sad day when members of one of America's most elite corps of soldiers, the Army Rangers, are alleged to have become involved in criminal activity,\" U.S. Attorney David E. Nahmias said of the case. \"These men were trained to defend the people and principles of this country, not to use their skills to steal cocaine from drug dealers at gunpoint.\" Lopez, White and Champagne were arrested Thursday at a storage facility in Sandy Springs, Georgia, a suburb just north of Atlanta, by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who had set up a sting operation. Spivey was apprehended at Camp Frank D. Merrill, an Army Ranger training center in Dahlonega, Georgia, on Friday, the ATF said. Dahlonega is about 60 miles north of Atlanta. Lopez, White and Champagne were to commit the robbery while Spivey covered for them back at the camp, where the men are stationed, according to an affidavit filed with U.S. District Court. All four were to get a cut of the spoils of the robbery, the affidavit from ATF Agent Brett Turner says. The investigation began in November, when the ATF \"became aware\" that some soldiers were interested in robbing drug dealers of their cocaine, Turner says. He posed as a disaffected security guard for the drug traffickers who wanted to \"rip them off.\" The first try to set up the \"robbery\" failed, but a second attempt earlier this month succeeded, leading to the arrests at the storage facility and, a day later, the Ranger camp. A subsequent search found that Lopez, White and Champagne were carrying semiautomatic pistols and had an AR-15 assault rifle and a field pouch with 15 magazines of ammunition for it in their vehicle. Agents also found a ski mask, binoculars and a Taser among the items the men brought with them. The four soldiers face minimum mandatory sentences of 10 years in prison each for the drug conspiracy and an additional five years, consecutive, for the weapons allegation. The Army Rangers are an elite light infantry fighting force capable of deploying anywhere in the world within 18 hours. They became a permanent presence in the U.S. military in the 1970s. From the Colonial Era until that time, Rangers were activated for specific missions or conflicts and then deactivated when their work was completed.

Opposition supporters wave an Armenian flag during a protest rally in Yerevan, Armenia, on Saturday. The protesters claim last month's presidential election was rigged. The state of emergency will \"hopefully bring some order\" to the capital, Yerevan, said Salpi Ghazarian, assistant to the Armenian foreign minister, who spoke to CNN early Sunday. The state of emergency could last until March 20, she said, but the government hopes \"that it will be lifted sooner.\" The clashes began when authorities used force to clear Freedom Square of thousands of demonstrators who had camped there for the past 10 days, according to a U.S. Embassy official. Ghazarian said the authorities \"moved in\" because \"they thought that there were arms there, and it turned out that they were right.\"  Watch a report on clashes between police and the opposition \u00bb . The embassy official estimated that the demonstrations in Freedom Square grew to as many as 60,000 Armenians at times over the last 10 days. As of early Sunday morning, Freedom Square was empty, Ghazarian said, but the protesters were demonstrating in a main square elsewhere in the city.  Watch Ghazarian discuss the situation in Armenia \u00bb . \"What is happening on the streets of Yerevan is people protesting what they consider to be unfair elections,\" Ghazarian said. \"After the president was forced to declare a state of emergency, things have quieted down. There are a couple of burning cars, and there are a few hurt people,\" she said. \"We're convinced that this will come to an end soon.\" She did not elaborate on the number of people injured or the extent of their injuries. Witnesses told CNN that Saturday morning's action by Armenian riot police was bloody, but the U.S. official said there were no confirmed deaths or serious injuries. An Armenian woman interviewed by CNN said there was \"huge chaos\" when police moved in. \"These are innocent people,\" she said. \"They just want their freedom. They just want to be heard. They are being beaten up, some people have horrible wounds.\" She asked that CNN not use her name because she feared for her safety. As night fell Saturday, the sounds of gunfire could be heard from the direction of the protesters' gathering, and tracer fire could be seen in the sky, according to another Yerevan resident, who also asked not to be identified out of fear for his safety. The man said his wife saw two demonstrators hit by a police car earlier in the day. The car initially did not stop, he said, but the protesters surrounded the car, dragged the officers out and burned the vehicle, he said. The officers were able to escape, he said, but he did not know the condition of the protesters who were struck. The protests began soon after the February 19 presidential election. Opposition presidential candidate Levon Ter-Petrosian lost to Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian, a political ally of outgoing President Kocharian. The opposition party immediately accused the government of vote fraud and demanded that the results be voided. Ghazarian said Sunday that the government had reached out to the opposition. \"We are hoping with the help of the international community, the opposition, the leader of the opposition, will come and enter a political dialogue rather than continuing this debate on the streets,\" she said. Haroutiun Khachatrian, editor of the Noyan Tappan News Agency, told CNN that riot police arrested several hundred people in the square Saturday morning, including many opposition party officials. Ter-Petrosian was there but was not arrested, he said. The opposition vowed to pursue its claims through legal means. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitored last month's Armenian election and concluded that it was mostly in line with international standards, although it did include some criticism in its report. The U.S. Embassy has warned the several hundred Americans living in Yerevan to stay at home and avoid the downtown area where the demonstrations have been taking place, the U.S. official said. Armenia, population 3 million, is a former Soviet republic east of Turkey, south of Georgia and north of Iran.

Attempts are being made to contain Thursday night's 2.7 million-gallon sewage spill. The 2.7 million-gallon spill occurred Thursday night. A pump failed at the South Marin Sanitation District's waste treatment facility in the town of Mill Valley, said Lt. Doug Pittman. The waste was released into Richardson Bay, an inlet of the large bay on the east shore of Marin County, he said.  See the spill from the air \u00bb . The sewage and storm water was partially treated, according to Greg Renick of the California Office of Emergency Services. In addition to the pump failure, he said, an alarm that would have alerted workers at the facility to the spill also failed. The accidental release occurred between 5:30 and 8:30 p.m. Thursday, according to a statement from Marin County's emergency operations center.  But the Sewerage Agency of Southern Marin didn't report it to the state until 11:16 p.m., Renick said. The state Office of Emergency Services notified local offices in the bay area within an hour of receiving the report, he said. The Marin County Department of Environmental Health was conducting tests Friday to determine how far the contamination had spread, Pittman said. Boaters were being warned to avoid the Richardson Bay area, and residents were told to avoid contact with the water. The California Department of Fish and Game has had a boat and personnel on the water since early Friday, and has found no sign of sick or distressed wildlife resulting from the spill, agency spokesman Steve Martarano said.

John \"Jackie the Nose\" D'Amico, shown in 1992, is one of 62 people indicted. Sixty-two members of the Gambino, Genovese and Bonanno families face 80 charges, ranging from money laundering to illegal gambling and murder. \"These charges strike at the very core of the Gambino family,\" said Benton Campbell, United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York. The Gambino family profited from extortion within the New York construction industry and its labor unions, according to the charges.  Watch the perp walk \u00bb . Several companies allegedly paid a \"mob tax\" in return for \"protection\" and \"permission to operate,\" said Gordon Heddell, inspector general of the U.S. Department of Labor. Other charges involve an alleged illegal gambling ring, said Richard Brown, Queens County district attorney. Nicholas Corozzo -- a reputed captain in the Gambino family -- was involved in a sports gambling enterprise that relied in part on toll-free telephones, Brown alleged. Meanwhile, four members of the Gambino family are charged with eight crimes involving murder, according to the indictment. Those charges include the felony murder of Jose Delgado Rivera, who was shot and killed in an armored truck during a robbery in 1990. \"Today we are able to bring closure to crimes from the past that have never been forgotten,\" Campbell said. He said the crimes span back over three decades.  Watch feds say they've 'cut off the head' of crime family \u00bb . Key to the Gambino arrests Thursday was a member of the Attorney General's Organized Crime Task Force who infiltrated the Gambino family and recorded hundred of hours of conversations, said John Milgrim, a spokesman for the attorney general. Forty-five of those charged are already in custody, police said. Arrests were made in New York City; Long Island, New York; and New Jersey. \"It is as unrelenting as weeds that continue to sprout in the cracks of society,\" New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said of organized crime. \"We will not rest until organized crime is a distant memory.\" In addition to the arrests in the New York area, police in Italy detained 77 people in connection with organized crime. Those arrests netted important members of a powerful clan in Sicily linked to Mafia boss Salvatore Lo Piccolo, who was believed to be the successor of the boss of bosses, Bernardo Provenzano.  Watch the prosecutor explain why authorities acted now \u00bb . Police say that in his attempt to rise to power, Le Piccolo tried to mend fences with New York-based Mafia families after those ties were broken during the bloody Mafia wars of the 1980s. Those families included the Gambinos of New York and the Inzerillos of Italy. Provenzano was arrested two years ago in Corleone. \"It is evident that the intent of the Mafia in Palermo was to re-establish a dialogue through the Inzerillo family in the U.S,\" Francesco Messineo of the Italian Police said. \"A dialogue that was never interrupted because the relationship between the American and the Italian Mafia is historic, based on long tradition. But there was certainly an attempt to re-establish that connection.\" Investigators believe mob clans wanted to collaborate on illegal commercial ventures such as money laundering and drug trafficking. Italian officials said the arrests were aimed at preventing these illegal activities, but they warned that other Mafia clans in Sicily oppose the return of the Inzerillo family to the island, and therefore were concerned about a new Mafia war.

Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in an unknown location in Iraq after his capture in 2003. According to a CBS report, Hussein claimed he didn't anticipate that the United States would invade Iraq over WMD, agent George Piro said on \"60 Minutes,\" scheduled for Sunday broadcast. \"For him, it was critical that he was seen as still the strong, defiant Saddam. He thought that (faking having the weapons) would prevent the Iranians from reinvading Iraq,\" said Piro. During the nearly seven months Piro talked to Hussein, the agent hinted to the Iraqi that he answered directly to President Bush, CBS said in a posting on its Web site. \"He told me he initially miscalculated ... President Bush's intentions. He thought the United States would retaliate with the same type of attack as we did in 1998 ... a four-day aerial attack,\" Piro said. \"He survived that one and he was willing to accept that type of attack.\" \"He didn't believe the U.S. would invade?\" Correspondent Scott Pelley asked. \"No, not initially,\" Piro answered. Once it was clear that an invasion was imminent, Hussein asked his generals to hold off the allied forces for two weeks, Piro said. \"And at that point, it would go into what he called the secret war,\" the agent said, referring to the insurgency. But Piro said he was not sure that the insurgency was indeed part of Hussein's plan. \"Well, he would like to take credit for the insurgency,\" he said. Hussein had the ability to restart the weapons program and professed to wanting to do that, Piro said. \"He wanted to pursue all of WMD ... to reconstitute his entire WMD program.\" Hussein said he was proud he eluded U.S. authorities who searched for him for nine months after the U.S.-led invasion, Piro said. \"What he wanted to really illustrate is ... how he was able to outsmart us,\" Piro said. \"He told me he changed ... the way he traveled.

Yet these descriptions belie the complexity of the 44 million people to whom they refer. Susana Clar, with daughters Vanessa (left) and Virna (center), says the labels \"Hispanic\" and \"Latino\" are limiting. Even the terms used to name them -- Hispanics, Hispanic-Americans, Latinos, Latino-Americans, the Spanish-surnamed -- too tightly package the people categorized by those definitions, some observers say. \"We are mixed and we are many things,\" said Phillip Rodriguez, a documentary filmmaker. Many of his films, such as \"Los Angeles Now\" and \"Brown is the New Green: George Lopez and the American Dream,\" explore the experience and identity of Latinos in the United States. Latinos \"very often don't share language, don't share class circumstances, don't share education; it's very difficult to speak about them as one thing,\" he said. From a census standpoint, being of Hispanic or Latino origin means a person identifies himself in one of four listed categories: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban or \"other Spanish, Hispanic or Latino\" origin. In the latter more open-ended category, respondents can write in specific origins, such as Salvadoran, Argentinean or Dominican. According to a Pew Hispanic Center/Kaiser Family Foundation survey in 2002, that is how most Latinos choose to identify themselves. When asked which terms they would use first to describe themselves, 54 percent said they primarily identify themselves in terms of their or their parents' country of origin. About one quarter choose \"Latino\" or \"Hispanic,\" and 21 percent chose \"American.\" But the broader terms -- Latino, Hispanic -- are the ones tossed about when the media want to discuss a \"trend among Latinos,\" or when a politician appeals to the \"Hispanic vote.\" The U.S. government came up with the term \"Hispanic\" in the 1970s to generally refer to people who could trace their origin to Spanish-speaking countries. The term \"Latino\" refers to origins from Latin America, which includes non-Spanish speaking countries like Brazil. The terms are often used interchangeably, which is a point of some contention in the wider community. But do the terms carry meaning among the people to whom they refer, or are they merely governmental designations? \"That's the way you call our people,\" Susana Clar, 52, said of the terms. She and her family emigrated from Uruguay nearly two decades ago, and she works as a vice president in her daughter, Vanessa Di Palma's, Salt Lake City, Utah-based communications firm. \"Either you are Latino [or] Hispanic. I'm fine with that, but I think that we are so much more than that,\" Clar said. Manuel Baez, 49, a native of the Dominican Republic who owns an insurance agency in Tampa, Florida, laughingly answered the question of how he identifies himself. \"Manuel or Manny,\" he said, adding, \"We're being put together in this package and that's too hard,\" he said, stressing that he didn't like labels. He continued, \"Dominican-American really represents who I am, instead of Dominican or Latino.\" He never uses Hispanic to identify himself because \"I am mixed,\" Baez said. \"Hispanic doesn't go with me because I don't believe that Spain was the best thing for Latin America.\" \"For me...there is no such thing as a Latino identity,\" said Suzanne Oboler, professor of Puerto Rican and Latino studies at John Jay College at the City University of New York. \"There's certainly a cultural understanding... [And] a political identity,\" she said, noting that the many different groups will join on particular issues such as immigration and wages. But she stressed that it was not a homogenous group. \"Not all Latinos speak Spanish, for example. Not all Latinos are going to vote Democratic... All Latinos are not immigrants.\" Others, such as Carl J. Kravetz, a longtime veteran of Hispanic marketing, said similarities among the different subsets of Latinos do show a Latino identity, one partly fused through the group's experience in the United States. Kravetz heads a Los Angeles-based Hispanic advertising agency called cruz/kravetz: IDEAS. The Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies embarked on a Latino cultural identity project last year -- when Kravetz was the organization's chairman -- to better understand a group of consumers they felt could not be adequately reached through the traditional Spanish-language market. There is \"very definitely a Latino identity,\" Kravetz said. It is drawn along parallels in values and ways of thinking and regardless of country of origin, the group tends to \"cluster\" in a few areas, he said. Those areas include interpersonal relationships (Latinos tend to emphasize family; individuality is not as important), perceptions of time and space (they have longer time horizons and have a relaxed sense of privacy), and spirituality (religion and spirituality have a strong influence on Latino life and perception of the world). David Chitel, the founder of New Generation Latino Consortium, a group of advertising and media companies, also said there are definite cultural ties among Latinos, particularly between those born in the United States. So much so, he said, that he and others coined the term \"new generation Latinos\" to refer to them. \"We're talking about people that have grown up here in the U.S. in Latino households, most likely with their parents speaking Spanish at home, eating certain foods at home, certain values and traditions that are instilled in them, from music to religious beliefs to the importance of family, these sorts of things,\" Chitel said. \"And it creates very much an identity that is Latino.\" Chitel said this group of U.S.-born Latinos should be reached with culturally nuanced media, in the same way the African-American market functions. Still, some chafe at the labels. \"Every time it comes up it just kind of annoys me and makes me mad,\" Anna Rivas, of Boulder, Colorado, said of her background. Her parents emigrated from Mexico before she was born, but she said she's never identified with the Mexican culture. \"On a regular basis I get asked where I'm from,\" she said. \"And I'll usually reply, 'My parents are from Mexico.' And I don't say, 'I'm Hispanic or Latino, or I'm from Mexico,' because I'm not.\" E-mail to a friend .", "da780ee614304d195bde3b7549313c02990d072e": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Navy has moved the guided-missile destroyer USS Cole and other ships to the eastern Mediterranean Sea off Lebanon, Pentagon officials said Thursday.

Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday. \"It isn't meant to send any stronger signal than that,\" he said. \"But it does signal that we're engaged and we are going to be in the vicinity, and that's a very important part of the world.\" The Cole was badly damaged by an al Qaeda bombing during a port call in Yemen in 2000, killing 17 sailors.

Another six vessels, led by the amphibious assault ship USS Nassau, are close to Italy and steaming toward the other three, the officials said. Mullen would not say whether the deployment has anything to do with the upcoming Lebanese parliamentary vote on a new president, which was postponed for a 15th time earlier this week. But he said the vote was \"important,\" and Washington was waiting for it to take place.

The ships \"should be there a while,\" the official added. Lebanon's pro-Western majority in parliament and the pro-Syrian opposition have battled for power over the last three years. The country has been without a president since November, when pro-Syrian leader Emile Lahoud's term expired and parliament was unable to agree on a replacement. Despite general agreement among the factions to award the post to army chief Gen. Michel Suleiman, disagreements over how to share power in a future Cabinet have kept the issue from coming up for a vote. Parliament speaker Nabih Berri's office announced Tuesday that the next planned session has been pushed back to March 11. Berri's office said the Arab League needed more time to break the deadlock. Lebanon has been wracked by a sometimes-violent power struggle since the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, whose supporters blamed Damascus for his killing. The resulting outcry eventually drove Syrian forces out of Lebanon, where they had been stationed since the 1970s. E-mail to a friend .

But McCain said earlier Tuesday that he was confident he would emerge as the presumptive nominee by the end of the night.

See county-by-county results in Texas . Eighty-three percent of blacks voted for Obama, while 16 percent supported Clinton, according to the exit poll. Meanwhile, 64 percent of Hispanics backed Clinton, while 32 percent went for Obama. Early exit polls indicate a distinct \"age gap\" in both states. Obama appealed most strongly to younger voters while older voters favored Clinton. Among Ohio Democratic primary voters aged 17 to 29, 65 percent went for Obama, and 34 percent went for Clinton. Among those age 60 and older, Clinton led Obama 67-31 percent. The same pattern held true in early exit polling from the Texas Democratic primary. Among voters aged 18 to 29, Obama led Clinton 61-39 percent, and among voters 60 and older, Clinton led Obama 63- 36 percent.

Sen. Barack Obama addresses Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached. Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina share the stage at Myrtle Beach's Palace Theatre as the nation honors the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. with a federal holiday. The debate, put together by CNN and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, comes five days before the Democratic primary in South Carolina, where almost half of the Democratic primary voters are African-Americans. These voters will be crucial to the outcome of Saturday's primary in South Carolina. They now appear to be leaning heavily toward Obama, who if elected, would become the country's first black president. Having a debate on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in South Carolina \"is very fitting,\" said David Bohrman, CNN senior vice president and Washington bureau chief, who is executive producer of the debate. \"Perhaps a debate on Martin Luther King Day in South Carolina should be made a must-stop on the road to the White House every four years.\" A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Friday suggested that nearly 60 percent of black registered Democrats were backing Obama as the presidential nominee, with 31 percent supporting Clinton. That's a major shift from October, when African-Americans backed Clinton over Obama, 57 percent to 33 percent. What appears to have changed is Obama's electability. \"There's been a huge shift among African-American Democrats from Clinton to Obama. African-American Democrats used to be reluctant to support Obama because they didn't think a black man could be elected. Then Obama won Iowa and nearly won New Hampshire. Now they believe,\" Bill Schneider, CNN's senior political analyst, said. \"Obama's lead over Clinton among black men is more than 50 points, and among black women, once a Clinton stronghold, Obama has an 11-point advantage,\" said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director. Entrance polls from Saturday's Nevada Democratic caucuses match what appears in the CNN poll. Eighty-three percent of black voters questioned before they entered the caucuses said they were backing Obama, with 14 percent supporting Clinton, who if elected, would become the country's first woman to win the presidency. These kinds of numbers could spell trouble in South Carolina for Clinton, who's coming off victories in the New Hampshire primary and the Nevada caucuses. But Clinton holds a special relationship with many in the black community, thanks to her efforts in support of civil rights and to the popularity of former President Clinton with African-Americans. Both Democratic front-runners were reaching out to African-American voters Sunday. Obama, who often refers to King in his speeches, spoke at Atlanta, Georgia's Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the late civil rights leader once preached.  Watch Clinton, Obama reach out to black voters \u00bb . Obama recalled the legacy of discrimination against African-Americans but challenged the audience at the historic black church to take a look at a few lingering prejudices among some within the community. \"And yet, if we are honest with ourselves, we must admit that none of our hands are entirely clean. If we're honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that our own community has not always been true to King's vision of a beloved community,\" Obama said, citing homophobia, anti-Semitism and anti-immigrant sentiment.

He won the primary there in 2004 when he was making his first bid for the White House. But he's running a distant third in most recent surveys in South Carolina, behind Obama and Clinton. On Sunday, Edwards sounded a cautious note, saying South Carolina was important but just one \"part of the long process. ...

James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, cited the timing of the debate to help put the spotlight on issues important to blacks. Clyburn, the highest ranking African-American in Congress, was instrumental in having Monday's debate held in South Carolina. \"When we were dealing with the dates of the primary, we tried to work in the symbolism that it would have to all of the world, for that matter, to have this debate on Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday celebration,\" Clyburn told Blitzer, who is the moderator of the event.

Bhutto sits on stage at a campaign rally minutes before her assassination. \"For standing up outside the car, I think it was she to blame alone -- nobody else. Responsibility is hers,\" the former general told CBS' \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday. Bhutto was killed December 27 in Rawalpindi, south of the Pakistani capital Islamabad, while she was standing in an armored moving car after rallying supporters for now-postponed parliamentary elections. Her head was above the roof and unprotected at the time of the attack. The cause of her death is not clear: a bomber blew himself up near Bhutto's limousine and videotape showed a gunman present, though no autopsy has been carried out. Asked if Bhutto could have been shot, Musharraf said, \"Yes, absolutely, yes. Possibility.\" He has said he welcomes an international investigation. Musharraf, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999, rejected criticism that his government did not do enough to provide security to Bhutto, who was seeking to regain the post of prime minister. He noted that she had already survived one assassination attempt and \"was given more security than any other person.\" Asked about the hunt for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, widely rumored to be in the remote border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan, Musharraf said, \"There is no proof whatsoever that he's here. We are not particularly looking for him, but we are operating against this -- and al Qaeda and militant Taliban. And in the process, obviously, it is combined. Maybe we are looking for him also.\" And Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Mahmud Ali Durrani, told CNN's \"Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer\" that, \"If we knew where he was, we would have taken him out.\" Durrani added that Musharraf's comment about \"not specifically looking for Osama\" means that the Pakistani military is \"totally focused on destroying al Qaeda and the Taliban network and not just one person.\" About Bhutto's death, he noted only that the investigation is not completed \"and we should not jump to conclusions.\" Still, he added, \"if she had not come out of the vehicle, the protected and armored vehicle, maybe we would have seen her smiling face again today.\" Though Musharraf's popularity at home has plummeted, he retains support from GOP presidential contender Sen. John McCain. \"I think he's a good man,\" the Arizonan told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"But I think he's made mistakes, don't get me wrong. And we've got to move forward with these elections and have them free and fair. \"But I can work with him. He understands the threat to his country that the Taliban and al Qaeda present. And radical Islamic extremists. He's a very smart man. He'd be one of the first to go. They've tried to kill him nine times, OK? Nine times they've tried to kill Musharraf. He's not their favorite guy.\" The New York Times reported Sunday that the Bush administration is considering expanding covert operations in the western part of Pakistan to shore up support for Musharraf's government and to find bin Laden and his second in command, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Democratic presidential candidate Bill Richardson of New Mexico told CNN's \"Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer\" that, though he had not heard details of the plan, \"it sounds like a strategy that makes sense.\" He added, \"We have got to take whatever action is needed.\" Richardson has called for Musharraf to step down and has called for free and fair elections. \"What we need to do is ask Musharraf, push him, push him to step aside for the good of the country, because he is widely unpopular,\" he told CNN. Sen. Hillary Clinton, a Democratic presidential candidate from New York, said Saturday that she would try to persuade Musharraf to share the responsibility for safeguarding his country's nuclear weapons with a delegation from the United States and perhaps Great Britain. Meanwhile, detectives from Britain's Scotland Yard on Sunday once again examined the white Land Cruiser that Bhutto was riding in when she was assassinated, Pakistan's state-run news agency said. The Associated Press of Pakistan said the detectives also watched videos of Bhutto's last moments three times, and looked at bird's eye view photographs of Liaqat Bagh park taken from a building that overlooks the Rawalpindi public site. The team of five detectives arrived in Pakistan Friday after Musharraf agreed they should work alongside Pakistani agencies to determine how Bhutto was killed and who was responsible for her death. On Saturday, the team spent more than two hours at the park. Musharraf said he expected the Scotland Yard investigators to help \"solve all the confusion\" surrounding the case. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, wants a United Nations inquiry into his late wife's assassination. The Pakistan interior ministry say the former leader died when she hit her head on the lever of her car's sunroof after ducking for cover after a suicide bomb attack on her convoy. However, supporters of Bhutto insist she was shot prior to the explosion -- a view that some say is supported by video footage of the moments before the blast.

Riley Ann Sawyers was moved from Ohio to Texas by her mother. Prosecutors said they have not decided whether to seek the death penalty against the girl's mother, Kimberly Dawn Trenor, and Trenor's husband, Royce Clyde Zeigler II. Two-year-old Riley Ann Sawyers was beaten to death and her body was disposed of in Galveston Bay. Riley's body was found October 29 by a fisherman on an uninhabited island in the bay. It was wrapped in black plastic bags and stuffed in a blue, plastic bin. Her identity was not known at first, and police dubbed her \"Baby Grace.\" Police sketches of the child were widely distributed, and Sheryl Sawyers, the girl's paternal grandmother, contacted police from her Ohio home to say the drawing resembled her granddaughter. DNA testing confirmed the child's identity. Trenor, 19, and Zeigler, 24, were initially charged with injury to a child and tampering with evidence. But since the initial charges were filed last month the investigation has continued and police have gathered additional evidence, in addition to confirming Riley's identity, said a statement released Wednesday by Galveston County Criminal District Attorney Kurt Sistrunk. Based on that, the grand jury was asked to upgrade the charges, he said. A three-hour hearing was held Wednesday in which grand jurors heard testimony from five witnesses, including police and FBI investigators and the medical examiner. The grand jury deliberated for only three minutes Wednesday before upgrading the charges, Sistrunk said. Trenor told police Riley had been beaten and thrown across a room and that her head was held under water before she died July 24. She said the couple hid the girl's body in a storage shed for one to two months before putting it in the plastic container and dumping it into the bay. A medical examiner said Riley's skull was fractured in three places that would have been fatal injuries. Trenor and the girl moved to Texas from Ohio in May to be with Zeigler, who Trenor had met online. Sistrunk said the investigation is continuing, and a decision on whether to seek the death penalty will not be made until its conclusion.

A protest appeared in India in November against the Saudi sentence. Lawyer and human rights activist Abdul Rahman al-Lahem told CNN's Nic Robertson that the Justice Ministry has reinstated his license. Al-Lahem had previously told CNN that the Saudi judge revoked his license as punishment for speaking to the media about his client's case, which attracted international attention. His client, an engaged teenager, was raped by seven men who found her alone with a man unrelated to her. She has said she was meeting with the man to retrieve a photograph. The attack took place in Qatif in March 2006. The seven rapists were sentenced to two to nine years in prison but she also was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison for having violated the kingdom's strict Islamic law by being alone with an unrelated man. The woman's sentence provoked outrage in the West and cast light on the treatment of women under Saudi Arabian law. Under Saudi law, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or have surgery. In challenging what he said were his suspension and disbarment, al-Lahem said he had received threats on his life from the religious right. Last month, Minister of Justice Abdallah bin Mohammed al-Sheikh, in a phone call to a Saudi Television newscast, said the lawyer's license had never been revoked. \"Such decisions are made through institutions in the kingdom,\" he said. \"The punishment of the lawyer or any lawyer does not come from a reaction; it comes from a carefully examined procedure within a special council in the ministry.\" He said the council charged with deciding law license revocations had not issued any decisions in the case.

An Italian news agency says al Qaeda No. 2 Ayman al-Zawahiri began planning Bhutto's killing in October. But such a claim has not appeared on radical Islamist Web sites that regularly post such messages from al Qaeda and other militant groups. The source of the claim was apparently Italian news agency, Adnkronos International (AKI), which said that al Qaeda Afghanistan commander and spokesman Mustafa Abu Al-Yazid had telephoned the agency to make the claim. \"We terminated the most precious American asset which vowed to defeat [the] mujahadeen,\" AKI quoted Al-Yazid as saying. According to AKI, al Qaeda No. 2 Ayman al-Zawahiri set the wheels in motion for the assassination in October. One Islamist Web site repeated the claim, but that Web site is not considered a reliable source for Islamist messages by experts in the field. The DHS official said the claim was \"an unconfirmed open source claim of responsibility\" and the bulletin was sent out at about 6 p.m. to state and local law enforcement agencies. The official characterized the bulletin as \"information sharing.\" Ross Feinstein, spokesman for Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell, said the U.S. intelligence community is monitoring the situation and trying to figure out who is responsible for the assassination. \"We are not in a position to confirm who may be responsible,\" Feinstein said. Feinstein said that the intelligence community \"obviously analyze(s) open source intelligence,\" but he would not say whether the community believes the claim has any validity. For now, he said, there is \"no conclusion\" as to who may be responsible.

Democratic senators will hold short \"pro forma\" sessions over the holiday break to prevent recess appointments. Nearly all the senators left the Capitol for the Christmas holiday last week, but Democrats are keeping the Senate in session to block President Bush from making any recess appointments -- a constitutional mechanism that allows the president, during congressional recesses, to fill top government posts for up to one year without Senate confirmation. Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, opened and then immediately gaveled the Senate session to a close. He spent 57 seconds in the chamber. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, announced December 19 that he would keep the Senate open with a series of \"pro forma\" sessions through mid-January. Talks had just broken down with the White House on a deal that would have allowed the president to make dozens of those appointments if he agreed not to appoint one controversial official, Steven Bradbury, as the permanent head of the influential Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department. Bush declined to accept the Democrats' offer, and Reid refused to approve Bradbury because of concerns about his involvement in crafting legal opinions for the administration on interrogation techniques of terrorism suspects.

During remarks at the White House, Bush, flanked by economic advisers, said the nation's economy is at risk for a downturn and Congress must act to head off trouble. \"This growth package must be big enough to make a difference in an economy as large and dynamic as ours,\" Bush said. \"By passing a growth package quickly, we can provide a shot in the arm to keep a fundamentally strong economy healthy, and it will help keep economic sectors that are going through adjustments, such as the housing market, from adversely affecting other parts of our economy.\"  Watch more of Bush's tax outline \u00bb . It should equal about 1 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, or roughly $140 billion, he added. Bush said the economy will continue to grow but at a slower rate. The president offered no specific details of the proposed package, but he did insist that it include tax incentives for business, \"including small businesses, to make major investments in their enterprises this year.\" Bush also said the economic package must include \"rapid income tax relief\" for consumers to \"lift our economy at a time when people otherwise might spend less.\" Although Democratic leaders in Congress expressed general support for Bush's remarks, other Democrats on Capitol Hill met the president's proposal with suspicion. Two Democratic leadership aides made it clear Friday that the growth package would not win support from Democratic leaders unless it includes relief for low and middle income earners. \"We want to include people who pay taxes, not necessarily income taxes -- a lot of lower income people pay payroll taxes,\" said one aide. Another source stated flatly, \"We're not going to pass a bill in the House that doesn't include low-income people.\" Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, said he was disappointed that Bush did not include stimulus-spending measures aimed at helping the disadvantaged such as extending unemployment benefits. Schumer said such spending initiatives would jump-start the economy faster than tax cuts alone. \"I think if we avoid any of the ideological fights, we could actually pass something so that it would take effect on March 1,\" Schumer said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, expressed agreement with Bush on \"the need to provide assistance immediately,\" saying in a statement that \"we must invest our resources in such a way that injects confidence and consumer demand, promotes economic growth and creates jobs.\" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said, \"I also agree that our focus must be on finding temporary measures that will do the job effectively.\" Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, agreed that \"we must act swiftly to boost the economy\" but stressed the need to help families who \"are struggling every day to pay their bills, heat their homes and pay their mortgages.\" Bush's remarks came a day after talks on the subject with Democratic and Republican lawmakers, and following Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's call for a fiscal stimulus package to help an economy beset by plummeting stock prices and a credit and mortgage crunch. Bush said Friday he was encouraged by his discussions with lawmakers. \"I believe there is enough broad consensus that we can come up with a package that can be approved with bipartisan support.\" Existing income tax cuts supported by the Bush administration are due to expire in 2010, and the president called on Congress to make them permanent. \"Unless Congress acts, the American people will face massive tax increases in less than three years,\" Bush said. \"This tax increase would put jobs and economic growth at risk.\"   Watch experts explain how to goose the economy \u00bb .

Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers stressed the importance of whom any relief package would target. \"It needs to go to people who are going to spend it,\" Summers said Friday on CNN's \"American Morning.\" \"That means particularly those who rely on tax refunds -- those receiving benefits, those whose incomes have been hurt by the downturn.\" Bernanke told the House Budget Committee on Thursday that he does not believe the economy will enter a recession, but he said he expects growth to proceed at a slow pace this year and possibly into early 2009. He said Congress needs to take decisive action to boost the economy. \"To be useful, a fiscal stimulus package should be implemented quickly and structured so that its effects on aggregate spending are felt as much as possible within the next 12 months or so,\" Bernanke said. But he said any package should be \"explicitly temporary\" to avoid running up the government's long-term debt. Bernanke stopped short of suggesting that the Bush tax cuts should be made permanent, telling lawmakers he supports \"the law of arithmetic.\" \"What comes in at least has to equal what goes out at some point,\" he said. In 2001, Americans received checks from the government designed to stimulate the economy. Individuals received $300 and families $600. Twenty to 40 percent of the checks were spent within days.

He gave up a six-figure salary as a marketing consultant and dedicated his life to restoring the world's ocean reef ecosystems. \"I had been following this reef since I had been 14; it was where my first dive was,\" recalls Barber. \"When that one little tiny reef was lost, that sparked something in me. If we lost one and it took that tens of thousands of years to get here, how fast is this happening?\" Barber had caught a small glimpse of a larger global issue -- the destruction of the world's coral reefs -- and it scared him. According to the Nature Conservancy, if the present rate of destruction continues, 70 percent of the world's coral reefs will be destroyed by the year 2050. Not only are they home to 25 percent of all marine fish species, but the organization states that 500 million people rely on coral reefs for their food and livelihoods. So Barber and his father, a marine biologist and fellow diver, sat down to devise a solution to \"put the reef back.\" What started as a basic idea to shape concrete around a beach ball led to three years of research, testing and prototyping with the help of friends and college professors.  Watch as Barber explains his passion for saving reefs \u00bb . \"Our goal was to mimic nature, not dictate nature,\" says Barber. \"And that meant that I couldn't come up with an idea; I had to design something that would fit exactly what the reef required.\" The result was what Barber calls a \"Reef Ball.\" Made of concrete engineered to last more than 500 years, Reef Balls are circular structures with a hollow center that serve as a base habitat upon which a natural reef can grow. Portable, inexpensive and environmentally friendly, according to Barber, Reef Balls can be built anywhere and are used to mimic and rehabilitate all forms of oceanic reefs, such as mangrove, oyster and coral reefs. They can also help control erosion and stabilize shorelines.  Watch as an organization in Tampa tries to restore habitats for oysters \u00bb . To manufacture and place Reef Balls in marine habitats around the world, Barber established The Reef Ball Foundation in 1993. Today, the non-profit organization works with environmental agencies, universities, community groups and corporations and empowers others to build and restore their local marine ecosystems. \"[Reefs] have an incredible bearing on human life,\" says Barber. \"Without conserving these resources, they're going to be all gone before we even know what we've lost.\" According to Barber, marine conservation isn't just about Reef Balls, but they're one important tool. \"It's about saving natural reefs. It's about changing our behaviors,\" says Barber. \"It's better to save the reef that you have than to build a new one.\" Since its inception, the Reef Ball Foundation has placed Reef Balls in more than 59 countries. \"For me, personally, the satisfaction comes from diving on a Reef Ball and seeing that the environment has been rehabilitated; that the reef is actually there,\" says Barber. \"And that our grandkids will be able to see the same thing.\" E-mail to a friend .", "e510fc72b8ef595e45f1a510d0cad761ae1bd032": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Valerie Gooding is in the top five most powerful businesswomen in Europe as named by the Financial Times. She runs global health and care organization BUPA and under her leadership it has grown to over 8 million customers in over 190 countries and record revenues. CNN's Todd Benjamin spoke to her in London and began by asking her why there are so few women at the top. She said it goes beyond family issues. Gooding: Women sometimes don't put themselves forward for things. And one of the things I think about and talk about a lot is that women often lack confidence to go for the next job, the top job. They sometimes don't wish to compete or they don't think they're good enough for the next thing. Benjamin: Why do you think that is? Gooding: Partly a lack of role models, partly it may be conditioning from a very early age about what the role of women is in society and the family, in work. But also I think there is still -- I don't like to call it a glass ceiling, but I think there is still an unseen barrier for women, which is that, if you ask most business people, would they like to promote more women, they would all say yes, they'd love to: \"Where are these women, I want to promote them,\" will be the answer. But often they don't really automatically think of a woman first for a top job. Benjamin: And what advice would you give to women who want to try and make it to the top? Gooding: Well, first of all, to learn as much as you can and to make sure you've got the right experience, the right qualifications, and to enjoy each job for its own interest and job satisfaction. But I think another piece of advice I would give to women is not to be afraid to put themselves forward and say what it is they want, because I think one thing that happens with women, which perhaps is a gender difference, is that women often hang back and think \"I will be noticed for my results, everybody will see how great I am because I've delivered these exceptional outcomes\". But actually life isn't like that, you have to tell people about your results and your achievements, and men are often better at doing that than women are. Benjamin: What do you think separates good leadership from great leadership? Gooding: Well, I think good leaders should be judged on their results. And I think of a good leader you should be able to say \"she transformed the business,\" \"she upped the performance,\" \"she exceeded the expectations of the stakeholders.\" I think of a great leader I would go to that old Chinese saying, \"of a great leader the people will say \"we did it ourselves\"\". Benjamin: Do you think that women in general as managers are more inclusive than men? Gooding: No, I don't. In fact, I sometimes find these gender differences, when sort of represented in the business environment, are actually just not very useful. I think men and women have very different styles of leadership as individuals and I don't think it goes down to straightforward gender divide. Because I have seen women who are more autocratic and more leading from the front and more dictatorial, and I've equally seen men who are very consultative. So, I don't just think it divides that way. Benjamin: You clearly love what you do. What is it about business that you think is such a buzz?

The recently remodeled Monte Carlo Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, is shown after and before the fire. A bit over an hour after it began, the fire was fully contained, according to the fire departments in Las Vegas and Clark County. Firefighters would remain at the hotel until \"the fire is completely knocked out,\" said Clark County Fire Chief Steven M. Smith. Watch the fire chief explain the situation \u00bb . That would be at least through the afternoon, he said. It was mainly an exterior fire, although there might have been slight damage to some rooms, he told CNN after a news conference. The cause of the fire was unknown. Welders had been working on the roof.  See where the hotel is located \u00bb . No one was trapped, and there were no reports of major injuries, said Ed Cagalo of the Clark County Fire Department. The 32-floor building was completely evacuated. The blaze was reported about 11 a.m. Black smoke and flames poured from the fire, which roared through the building's exterior stucco and foam until firefighters were able to get on the roof and knock down the flames.  Watch the fire burn \u00bb . Most of the damage was to the top floor of the building. Falling debris ignited parts of an exterior ledge four floors below. \"High-rise fires are never easy to fight. As you can see with it being outside, our firefighters actually had to hang out the windows to try and cut the fire off. We directed our fire streams at an angle so we could make contact with the fire. ... It wasn't an easy fire at all,\" Smith said.  Watch the chief talk about the firefighting efforts \u00bb . He urged motorists and pedestrians to avoid the area. Earlier, the smoke was visible from more than a mile away, CNN producer Darian Billington said. Billington said traffic was backed up on the Strip, and crowds of people were gathering to watch the blaze. \"It was horrible, there was fire everywhere,\" a hotel worker who watched the flames from a parking lot told CNN affiliate KVBC. Four U.S. Air Force HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters with rescue crews were put on standby at Nellis Air Force Base during the afternoon to assist in any rescue efforts, but were not needed, a Nellis spokeswoman said. The hotel has more than 3,000 rooms, including 211 penthouse suites, and conference rooms. The more expensive rooms are on the top floors. The hotel was built in 1996 for $344 million. It is in the heart of the resort corridor. The Monte Carlo, a subsidiary of MGM Mirage, has about 3,000 employees. In 1980, a fire across the street at the MGM Grand Hotel, now Ballys, killed 84 people and injured nearly 700.

During an event Friday in Pella, Iowa, Huckabee said the crisis sparked by Bhutto's death should lead to a crackdown on illegal immigrants from Pakistan. The Huckabee official told CNN that when he said that, Huckabee was trying to turn attention away from scrutiny of his foreign policy knowledge. Huckabee's foreign policy credentials have been under a microscope since the candidate admitted that he was unaware of an intelligence report that Iran had suspended its nuclear weapons program earlier this month. \"In light of what happened in Pakistan yesterday, it's interesting that there are more Pakistanis who have illegally crossed the border than of any other nationality except for those immediately south of our border,\" Huckabee said Friday. Americans might \"look halfway around the world and say, 'How does that affect me?' ... We need to understand that violence and terror is significant when it happens in Pakistan, [and] it's more significant if it can happen in our own cities. And it happens if people can slip across our border and we have no control over them.\" \"The immigration issue is not so much about people coming to pick lettuce or make beds, it's about people who could come with a shoulder-fired missile and could do serious damage and harm to us,\" Huckabee said, \"and that's what we need to be worried about.\" The Huckabee official said he told Huckabee that his reaction to the crisis in Pakistan will be the story for the next several days, and until he is \"briefed and up to speed\" on Pakistan, a good place for Huckabee to draw the line is on illegal immigration.  Watch a report about the 'surprising tactic' \u00bb . \"Why does Rudy Giuliani get more credentials on homeland security than you do? You've been a governor,\" the Huckabee campaign official said he told the candidate. The campaign official admitted that Huckabee's tough immigration talk is also aimed at helping him win male GOP voters in Iowa -- a bloc the official concedes the campaign has been losing ground with. Huckabee said 660 Pakistanis entered the country illegally last year. When asked by a reporter the source for that statistic, Huckabee appeared unsure, saying, \"Those are numbers that I got today from a briefing, and I believe they are CIA and immigration numbers.\" The Huckabee campaign later said the figure came from a March 2006 report by The Denver Post. But the Border Patrol told CNN on Friday that it apprehended only \"a handful\" of illegal immigrants from Pakistan in 2007. The number of illegal immigrants from Pakistan deported or apprehended is not mentioned in the latest report from the Department of Homeland Security/Office of Immigration Statistics. In 2005, the nation did not make the list of the top 10 sources of illegal immigrants. The previous year, Pakistan was the last country listed, but no specific numbers were given. Huckabee is the GOP front-runner in Iowa, according to most polls. A Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll conducted December 20-23 and 26 has Huckabee leading former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney 36 percent to 28 percent among likely caucus goers. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 7 percentage points. As the campaigns enter the final stretch before the Iowa caucuses on January 3, Romney has gone on the attack against Huckabee, particularly focusing on his record on illegal immigration issues while he was Arkansas governor. Huckabee's Friday comments on immigration came after he appeared to make another gaffe Thursday, when he seemed to suggest incorrectly that Pakistan was under martial law.  Watch Huckabee's response to Bhutto's assassination \u00bb . While commenting on Bhutto's death during an Orlando, Florida, press conference, Huckabee told reporters that the United States' first priority should be to find the responsible parties. \"But the most urgent thing to do is to offer our sincere sympathies and concerns to the family and to the people of Pakistan, and that's the first thing we would be doing other than, again, trying to ascertain who's behind it, and what impact does it have on whether or not there's going to be martial law continued in Pakistan, suspension of the constitution,\" Huckabee said. \"Those are concerns that the United States certainly should have.\" Later Thursday, at an event in West Des Moines, Iowa, Huckabee told CNN that \"it was not that I was unaware it was suspended, two weeks ago, lifted. ...The point was, would it be reinstated, would it be placed back in? All of the aspects of martial law have not been completely lifted even now. There's still a heavy hand Musharraf has used.\" Conservative critics immediately pointed out that Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf lifted the country's state of martial law roughly two weeks ago. The slip \"ought to be really bad news for Huckabee,\" said the National Review's Jim Geraghty, writing on the magazine's Web site. \"I'm not sure how big assassination-related news will play in the first primary states. Still, I think those misstatements will exacerbate the Huck/Not Huck divide in GOP circles.\" The National Review has endorsed Romney. But CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said the debate over whether Huckabee has command of the nuances of the Pakistan crisis would have little impact on his support. \"Mike Huckabee is a populist. His comments on Pakistan reflect a populist understanding of the crisis, which, is to say, not much,\" Schneider said. \"Sure, the political establishment is snickering, but I doubt that his misstatements bother his supporters much.\" E-mail to a friend .

President Bush draws parallels Wednesday between the cost of pulling out of Iraq and \"the tragedy of Vietnam.\" \"Three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left,\" Bush told members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, at their convention in Kansas City, Missouri. \"Whatever your position in that debate, one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens, whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like 'boat people,' 're-education camps' and 'killing fields,' \" the president said. The White House billed the speech, as it did next week's address to the American Legion, as an effort to \"provide broader context\" for the debate over the upcoming Iraq progress report by Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad. Bush also sought to shore up the perception of his support for Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, after voicing some frustration with him on Tuesday. \"Prime Minister Maliki's a good guy -- good man with a difficult job and I support him,\" Bush said. \"And it's not up to the politicians in Washington, D.C., to say whether he will remain in his position.  Watch Bush reiterate his support for al-Maliki \u00bb . Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, said Bush had drawn the wrong lesson from history: . \"America lost the war in Vietnam because our troops were trapped in a distant country we did not understand supporting a government that lacked sufficient legitimacy with its people,\" Kennedy said in a statement. Sen. Joe Biden, Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, invoked his own Vietnam analogy in a statement released after the speech: . \"It's the president's policies that are pushing us toward another Saigon moment -- with helicopters fleeing the roof of our embassy -- which he says he wants to avoid.\" Biden said Bush continues to cling to the premise that Iraqis will rally behind a strong central government, but he believes that will not happen. \"There's no trust within the Iraqi government; no trust of the government by the Iraqi people; no capacity of that government to deliver security or services; and no prospect that it will build that trust or capacity any time soon,\" Biden's statement said. But House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio said more Democrats are \"bucking their party leaders\" in acknowledging progress in Iraq. \"Many rank-and-file Democrats have seen this progress firsthand and are now acknowledging the successes of a strategy they've repeatedly opposed,\" Boehner said in a statement. \"But Democratic leaders, deeply invested in losing the war, would rather move the goalposts and claim that a precipitous withdrawal is the right approach despite the overwhelming evidence of significant progress.\" Former presidential adviser David Gergen said Bush ran the risk of doing as much harm as good for his case. \"By invoking Vietnam he raised the question, 'if you learned so much from history, how did you ever get us involved in another quagmire?' \" Gergen said. Gergen said he did agree with Bush in one respect, though: \"He's right, initially when we pulled back in Vietnam there were massive killings.\" On Tuesday, Bush had expressed frustration with the pace of progress toward political reconciliation in Iraq, saying if the Iraqi government doesn't \"respond to the demands of the people, they will replace the government.\" Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Wednesday shot back at criticism of his government, including pointed remarks from a U.S. senator who called his administration \"nonfunctioning\" and urged Iraq's parliament to turn it out of office. Speaking at a press conference in the Syrian capital of Damascus, al-Maliki characterized such comments as \"irresponsible\" and said they \"overstep the bounds of diplomatic and political courtesy.\" Government spokesman Ali Dabbagh told CNN that al-Maliki was referring to comments made Monday by Sen. Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, who called on Iraq's parliament to turn al-Maliki's \"nonfunctioning\" government out of office when it returns in two weeks. Levin said al-Maliki's government was \"too beholden to religious and sectarian leaders\" to reach a political settlement that would end the country's sectarian and insurgent violence. In his speech, Bush said withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today's terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility, citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam. \"Here at home, some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently,\" Bush said. President Bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the American people -- to withhold judgment on his troop \"surge\" in Iraq until the report comes out in September. It is being closely watched on Capitol Hill, particularly by Republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq might begin. Bush's speeches Wednesday and next week are the latest attempts by the White House to try to reframe the debate over Iraq, as public support for the war continues to sag. A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of Americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the Iraq war, and 72 percent say the Petraeus report will have no effect on their opinion. The poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report; 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq. In addition to his analogy to Vietnam, Bush referred to previous conflicts in Asia in talking about the war against terror in Iraq. \"There are many differences between the wars we fought in the Far East and the war on terror we are fighting today,\" Bush said. \"But one important similarity is that at their core, they are all ideological struggles. \"The militarists of Japan and the Communists in Korea and Vietnam were driven by a merciless vision for the proper ordering of humanity. They killed Americans because we stood in the way of their attempt to force this ideology on others.\" Bush said history proved skeptics wrong about Japan's ability to become a free society and will prove those who want to withdraw from Iraq wrong. \"In the aftermath of Japan's surrender, many thought it naive to help the Japanese transform themselves into a democracy. Then, as now, the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom,\" Bush said. \"Today, in defiance of the critics, Japan ... stands as one of the world's great free societies.\" E-mail to a friend .", "305a7272b28da5bc5574487ca0a09f48b852788c": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- They prefer the darkness and calm of early morning when their targets are most vulnerable, still sleeping or under the influence. They make sure their prey -- suspected killers and other violent fugitives -- know what they're up against. U.S. Marshal supervisory inspector James Ergas takes aim during a computer-simulated attack. \"When they wake up to a submachine gun and flashlight in their face, they tend not to fight,\" says James Ergas, the supervisory inspector for the U.S. Marshals Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force. The U.S. Marshals Service is the nation's oldest law enforcement agency and best known for protecting federal judges, transporting federal prisoners and protecting witnesses. Less known is the cutting-edge work of the agency's six regional task forces in capturing suspects. The task force in Atlanta is located in a nondescript warehouse office park. In 2007, the investigators from the Southeast task force arrested more than 3,000 suspects; only once did the Marshals exchange gunfire, Ergas says.  Watch Ergas blast bad guys in simulated attack \u00bb . \"This is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the Marshal Service,\" says Eugene O'Donnell, a former prosecutor and New York City police officer who now teaches at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. On any given day, Ergas and his force are tracking 10 to 15 suspected killers roaming the Southeast, while also searching for other violent offenders. Already this year, they have been involved in a number of high-profile searches: Gary Michael Hilton, the suspect charged in the killing of Meredith Emerson who disappeared while hiking in northern Georgia; a fugitive Marine wanted in connection with the killing of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach in North Carolina; and suspects wanted in connection with the killings of two suburban Atlanta police officers. But most of the time they're chasing suspects outside of the glare of the media spotlight. \"Our mandate is to track violent fugitives -- murderers, armed robbers, rapists and fugitives of that caliber,\" says Keith Booker, the commander of the task force.  Watch Booker describe their mission \u00bb . One suspect currently being hunted is Charles Leon Parker who has been on the run since the 1980s after being accused of molesting his stepdaughters. The Marshals were brought in recently, Booker says, after Parker allegedly called one of his victims and said, \"I wanted you to know I saw you and your daughter, and she sure is beautiful.\" O'Donnell says it takes highly trained, high energy, \"really special people\" to do such work day in and day out, especially when they're up against \"some of the most dangerous individuals in the country.\" \"It's not an exaggeration to say they're the front of the front line,\" O'Donnell says. \"It's not going to get any more challenging than this in law enforcement.\" To make sure they are well prepared, the Atlanta office is equipped with a locker full of high-powered weaponry; a high-tech operations center, complete with flat screen TVs, where they communicate directly with investigators in the field; a two-story house for training; and a 300-degree computer simulator that puts the Marshals into real life danger scenarios. In one demonstration, Ergas steps into the simulator and responds to reports of shots fired at a workplace. A woman rushes to a victim on the ground, as Ergas barks out commands. Moments later, a man rounds the corner. He too tends to the victim. Suddenly, the gunman runs into the corner and Ergas opens fire with his Glock. The suspect hits the ground.  Watch Ergas say there's no better training than the simulator \u00bb . A split second later, another gunman emerges, and Ergas blasts him too. Think of it as Wii on steroids. \"These are things you cannot get on a range,\" Ergas says. There are 50 different scenarios the simulator can create, with a technician able to change each scenario. A trainee can use a shotgun, rifle, Glock 22 or Glock 23. The guns shoot a laser and each shot is traced. Sometimes, the simulator jams the guns to see how one responds to the situation. After each training session, the person is debriefed about why he or she opened fire or didn't fire at all. Each shot is analyzed, because in the real world a law enforcement officer is held accountable for every bullet that comes out of his or her gun. It helps investigators train for situations they could face on any given day, at any given moment, Ergas says. \"No one wants to shoot anyone,\" Ergas says. \"Even officers that may not have pulled the trigger will be affected by shooting and killing someone.\" O'Donnell says the fact the task force rarely engages fire with suspects and that they have such rigorous training, \"underscores you can teach tactics.\" \"This is a model,\" he says. Booker says it helps having a coordinated team of armed officers with shields and big guns, as well. \"We overwhelm them with surprising speed and force,\" he says. \"That's what keeps us safe, and that's what keeps them safe.\" His message for those still out there? \"We'll pull all of our collective knowledge and resources and investigative techniques to hunt them down and take them into custody,\" Booker says. \"We won't stop until our job is finished.\" E-mail to a friend .", "9814600b03458475607fa2e4e9f1637138b7c9bf": "(InStyle.com) -- Check out these seven truly amazing destinations and plan the best place for your great escape.

There are reportedly only about 100 tigers, prized by so-called medicine men, left living in Vietnam. A Hanoi court convicted Nguyen Thi Thanh, 41, for \"violating regulations protecting rare wild animals.\" She was arrested last September after police raided a house that she rented in the capital city of Hanoi and found dead tigers, bear arms, monkey bones and elephant tusks. Officers found Thanh and three accomplices cooking tiger carcasses, the Thanh Nien daily reported. The three men received suspended sentences, ranging from 24 to 30 months, the daily said. The woman told police she sold the animals' bone marrow for 6.5 million Vietnamese dong ($400) per gram to traditional medicine men, according to reports at the time. Such medicine men think tiger bones and other parts can cure arthritis and other joint ailments, according to the Humane Society of the United States. Tigers are universally threatened, with only about 100 still living in Vietnam, the World Wildlife Fund said. The southeast Asian country has banned trafficking in endangered animal parts. Last year, the Vietnamese government unearthed 38 cases of illegal trafficking that involved 503 endangered animals, local media said at the time.

Heath Ledger is pictured with crew of the 2005 film \"Lords of Dogtown\" and members of the Zephyr skating team. CNN.com asked readers to share their memories of Ledger, who was found dead in a New York apartment Tuesday, January 22. Famous for his roles in the films, \"The Patriot\" and \"Lords of Dogtown,\" Ledger was widely acclaimed for his portrayal of the homosexual cowboy Ennis del Mar in 2005's \"Brokeback Mountain.\" CNN.com readers describe meeting Ledger in person, and call him humble and kind. Below are a selection of their responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity.  Donal Logue, actor, of Los Angeles, California  I met Heath eight years ago while working on \"The Patriot.\" He became a star while we were sequestered away in a small town in South Carolina based on the strength of the dailies going back to Los Angeles. Heath was a fantastically kind and sweet young man. He surrounded himself with his friends from Australia and never forgot any of us he ever worked with. I last saw him in Australia when he called my name on a Melbourne street and introduced me to Michelle, his (then) pregnant [girlfriend]. I have great memories of going for runs with him or watching a bootleg copy of a Parker and Stone's musical called \"Cannibal! The Musical of the Donner Party Tragedy.\" Heath must have been in a place of great pain and sadness to be split from his wife and child. He was sensitive and unfairly victimized in his native country by the unfortunate Australian custom called the \"tall poppy syndrome\" in which an Australian, the second he or she achieves global success, is immediately and arbitrarily accused of losing all of their humanity. Not true. He was a sweet person, and less importantly, an unbelievably talented actor. Maybe the best of his generation. Dan Bova of Larchmont, New York  Once when I was driving in Brooklyn, I got a flat tire. As I was jacking up my car, this deep voice from behind me said, \"Need a hand?\" It was Heath Ledger. I couldn't believe it. He helped jack up my car and change the tire. He was really good with tools! R. of Perth, Western Australia  I grew up with Heath around the speedway racing circuit. I remember the night he was a little boy and his Dad was racing speed cars at Claremont Speedway (my dad was in the race, too). His dad was coming 3rd then in the final corner, the two lead cars spun out and Heath's dad Kim took the lead and won the State Title race. Heath was standing a couple of rows in front of me with his mum and sister and they were all so excited, jumping up and down and cheering. He was about as happy as a little boy could be watching his dad become a champion. I remember that night because in the years that followed, I saw his parents marriage break up and it was like there was this moment in his childhood of pure joy that I witnessed. Later Heath would pit crew for Graham Jones, and I crewed for my dad and brother. Heath and I were both the youngest on our crews so that meant our job was to take the fiberglass bonnets over to the hoses and wash the mud off after each race really dirty work but he managed to stay cleaner than the rest of us. Crystal Davis of Toronto, Ontario  I met Heath in L.A. at a mall a year or so ago. I was staring at him working up the nerve to ask for an autograph. He saw me, started laughing and walked towards me. He said I was white as an \"egg\" and asked if he could do anything. I said, No thanks ... yes I forgot to ask for the autograph. He touched my shoulder and told me to take it easy and walked away. He looked back several times and smiled. What a great memory I have of him. My prayers go out to his family and friends. Dena Michnowich of Glen Cove, New York  I was walking in the lower east side of Manhattan one day and I noticed a really cute man holding his little daughter on his shoulders. She looked just like him. He told her that they had to make a right and asked her to point them in the right direction, which she did. I soon realized that it was Heath Ledger and I got really excited. I was walking right up to them as they were waiting to cross the street. When I got close, I waved and he smiled at me. He was so handsome I got the chills. I could also sense that he had a very sweet spirit. It was a very special moment for me. I'm so sad to hear that he died. Leanne Scorzoni of Staten Island, New York  I worked as a nanny for a number of years in Manhattan, and I ended up having a toddler class with my charge and Heath, Michelle and baby Matilda. The couple was so polite and laid back at first I didn't recognize who they were. They were genuinely interested in their child, her development, and treating the rest of us (including staff) with respect. He will be sorely missed. Michael Williams of Perth, Western Australia  I met Heath Ledger many years ago while I was working at a local fast food outlet here in Perth Western Australia. He came through to order and I was amazed at how polite, kind and friendly he was. He stopped to sign autographs while he waited knowing that to the people asking him he was somewhat of a hero. He did all this with the great Australian attitude that he had and a smile on his face, he was one superstar that took stardom well and in his stride, I for one feel thankful that I have met this great person. I send my deepest sympathy to his family and say to them that you do not mourn his passing alone; the people of Perth share your grief. Tracy Kimball of Rock Hill, South Carolina  I met Heath Ledger in 1999 while he was filming \"The Patriot\" in South Carolina. I was a reporter for a daily newspaper there and he was at a press conference about the movie at Historic Brattonsville, a Revolutionary-era plantation. He was so very kind and was more than happy to sign my newspaper. The media was flocking around Mel Gibson, but seeing a new young and dashingly gorgeous guy standing off to himself, I approached him and asked for his autograph. He flashed that smile, grabbed my pen and used my back to sign the newspaper I was holding. We had a conversation, but I don't remember it because I was so enamored. I had never heard of him before because the only American movie he had filmed was \"Ten Things I Hate About You,\" which I had not yet seen. I went back to the paper where I worked and wrote a story about the new hot Aussie star that would surely become hugely successful in America. His death really saddens me. He was such a talented actor and a new dad. Having a child the same age as his daughter, it makes me even sadder to think of her missing her father. Amanda Olmstead of Penticton, British Columbia  I met Heath when he was filming \"Brokeback Mountain\" in my hometown of Fort Macleod. He was a down to earth man with amazing talent. His portrayal of Ennis del Mar was life-changing for many of my friends. I am truly saddened by his death. Kristy O'Connor of Sydney, Australia  My heart goes out to Heath's family and little Matilda, I met Heath one time at a prenatal yoga class in Sydney with Michelle and was in awe of his devotion and attention to her. He was a true gentleman and I'm sure an amazing father. To make assumptions as to how or why he died is to bring more pain to an already devastated family. Adrian K. of Perth, Western Australia  I met Heath one night on the town in Perth. The one-degree of separation rule in Perth made him a friend of a friend. We had a brief and quiet chat. What struck me was his calm in the face of his monstrous burgeoning celebrity. With both of his feet planted firmly on the ground, he seemed to be facing the publicity with stoic resolve. Goodnight, Heath. You were a good bloke. \"A sad fan\" in Chicago, Illinois  I was an extra in the movie \"Dark Knight,\" which filmed in Chicago this past summer. I spend an entire weekend on set with Heath. He was rather quiet most of the time between takes, but seemed to be a nice, likeable guy. It was great to watch him work, as he was very committed to his craft. His death is a great loss. Kelly Fishburne of West Palm Beach, Florida  I met Heath Ledger while working in Atlanta. We both were taking a CNN tour. He was silly, smiling all the time and we spoke about horses and riding lessons. He was also talking about the movie the Patriot he filmed with Mel Gibson. He had to do lots of riding. He was down to earth and so very talkative. Just a normal guy, hanging out. A real gentleman. Jessi Lee of Central, South Carolina  I really enjoyed Heath's acting. His best movie was my favorite movie of 2005, \"Lords Of Dogtown.\" Heath played the somewhat obnoxious Skip Engblom, but thinking of all the other actors who could have taken the roll, I don't think anyone could have done it better. Even two of the original Zephyr shop boys themselves. Tony Alva & Stacy Peralta, said when Heath came in & did the voice he would use in the film, it was like hearing Skip from the past.

Blackwater CEO Erik Prince said Sunday that guards \"definitely\" faced insurgent fire September 16. \"There was definitely incoming small arms fire from insurgents\" in the September 16 incident in Baghdad, founder and CEO Erik Prince told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"Late Edition.\" There was no \"deliberate violence,\" committed by Blackwater employees, he added. Still, when asked whether it is possible someone with Blackwater \"screwed up\" in the incident, Prince replied, \"Certainly it's possible.\" He said he expects the FBI investigation to provide many answers. Meanwhile, U.S. and Iraqi officials continue discussing Baghdad's demand that Blackwater be expelled from Iraq within six months, The Associated Press reported Sunday. American officials are also coming up with ways to fill the security gap if Blackwater is forced to leave, AP reported. Blackwater guards, protecting U.S. officials in Iraq, face dangerous circumstances every day and have navigated the vast majority of those situations without any violence, Prince told CNN. The guards just try to do their jobs, and are \"not trying to make any trouble,\" he said. The Iraqi government accuses Blackwater guards of opening fire without provocation on civilians in a crowded area in Baghdad on September 16, killing 17 and wounding 27. Survivors told FBI investigators Blackwater guards shot at civilians presenting no threat.  Watch a Blackwater witness describe his account \u00bb . The first U.S. soldiers to arrive on the scene after the incident told military investigators they found no evidence contractors were fired upon, a source familiar with a preliminary U.S. military report told CNN. The soldiers found evidence suggesting the guards fired on cars attempting to leave and found weapon casings on the scene matching only those used by U.S. military and contractors, the military source said. But Prince on Sunday told CNN, \"In the incident reports I've seen, at least three of our armored vehicles were hit by small arms fire, incoming, and one of them damaged, which actually delayed their departure from the traffic circle while they tried to rig a tow. \"So there was definitely incoming small-arms fire from insurgents.\" He added, \"I guarantee our guys weren't shooting at each other.\" And he said the traffic circle is very big, so those first soldiers on the scene would have needed \"almost a battalion to secure that entire area, to do a thorough crime scene type investigation.\" \"So the jury is still out. We'll see what the FBI report comes up with, but I'm confident that the kind of people we have out there are proven military professionals,\" Prince said. Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh accused Blackwater of \"a deliberate crime against civilians,\" and said the company \"should be tried in court, and the victims should be compensated.\" A Philadelphia law firm has filed suit in federal court against Blackwater on behalf of the families of three Iraqis killed and one wounded in the in the incident, which occurred in and around Baghdad's Nusoor Square. The suit claims Blackwater \"created and fostered a culture of lawlessness amongst its employees, encouraging them to act in the company's financial interests at the expense of innocent human life.\" Prince called the lawsuit \"politically motivated\" for \"media attention,\" and rejected the depictions of his company. \"In Baghdad, the most dangerous city in the world, to say that it was a callous, rampant, evil action, you know, when the guys get it right 99 out of 100 times and don't have to use any force or any violence at all, I think they are doing very well,\" he said.

Tim Masters, center, walks out of a Fort Collins, Colorado, courthouse Tuesday with his attorney David Wymore. Court papers filed by District Attorney Larry Abrahamson cited \"newly discovered\" evidence, but took pains to state that evidence didn't clear Masters. \"While the newly discovered DNA evidence does not exonerate Timothy Masters, it clearly warrants a complete re-examination of all the evidence related to the murder of Peggy Hettrick,\" the court papers state. The motion seeks dismissal of the charges \"in the interest of justice.\" It points out the DNA testing used to uncover the new evidence wasn't available when Masters was investigated and tried. On Tuesday a judge threw out Masters' 1999 murder conviction, and he was freed -- also \"in the interest of justice.\" Although the motion signals that Abrahamson is dropping the Masters case, he did not rule out future prosecution. In a statement, the prosecutor cautioned: \"Contrary to news reports, the DNA testing results only suggest that there may be others, along with Timothy Masters, who should be investigated. These test results do not provide us with enough information to completely exonerate anyone.\" Abrahamson said he has asked Colorado Attorney General John Suthers to appoint a special prosecutor to continue the investigation of Hettrick's slaying. The attorney general will announce his decision early next week, Abrahamson said. Masters, 36, has been investigated for Hettrick's  murder since he was 15. He has insisted he had nothing to do with her death, and no physical evidence ties him directly to the crime.  Watch Masters describe his anger at police \u00bb . A jury convicted Masters 12 years after the discovery of Hettrick's stabbed and sexually mutilated corpse in a field near his trailer. Among the evidence jurors considered were a collection of knives found in Master's bedroom, gruesome sketches and testimony from a prosecution expert that he fit the psychological profile of a killer. Masters' defense team said he was framed, and that police and prosecutors sat on evidence that could have raised doubt about his guilt. The significance of Friday's motion to dismiss is largely procedural, but Abrahamson indicated earlier this week that it might be unnecessary to try Masters again. \"In light of newly discovered evidence revealed to me on Friday,\" Abrahamson said in a statement a week ago, \"I will be moving as expeditiously as possible to make the determination of whether all charges against Timothy Masters will be dismissed.\" Abrahamson also has vowed to review all \"contested convictions\" in which advances in DNA testing may prove useful. He said he wanted to examine the legal discovery process and that he had met with the Fort Collins police chief and his officers \"to discuss the critical flow of information with assurance that all information is available to our office and the defense.\" Special prosecutor Don Quick filed a motion earlier this month citing four instances in which police and prosecutors should have handed over evidence to Masters' original defense team.  See the key players in the case \u00bb . Among them was a police interview with a plastic surgeon who said it was improbable that a teen could have made the meticulous cuts necessary to remove Hettrick's body parts.

Jamie Lynn Spears, shown in September, stars in the popular Nickelodeon series \"Zoey 101.\" Spears, the star of Nickelodeon's \"Zoey 101,\" told OK! Magazine that she's pregnant and that the father is her 18-year-old boyfriend. There has been no public talk of criminal prosecution in the case. Consensual sex between the two may well have been legal, depending on where and when it took place. But critics of the nation's statutory rape laws say that laws that are ignored in some cases can be used to put other teens in prison and land them on sex-offender registries.  Watch CNN's Sunny Hostin on what the law says \u00bb . \"You have a disturbing disparity in how these laws are enforced,\" said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. \"I have no problem at all with nailing adults who sleep with children, but I have a problem with the prosecution of teenagers in consensual relationships. \"What this case should focus the nation on is having a more evenhanded approach to these cases.\"  Watch a psychologist talk about how Spears' pregnancy could lead to parents talking to their kids about sex \u00bb . In Louisiana, where Spears lives, it is a misdemeanor for someone age 17 to 19 to have consensual sex with someone age 15 to 17 if the difference between their ages is more than two years. In California, where she sometimes tapes her television show, it's a misdemeanor to have sex with someone younger than 18 if the offender is less than three years older. Someone more than three years older could be charged with a felony. According to OK! Magazine, which first reported the news Tuesday, Spears said the father of her baby is longtime boyfriend Casey Aldridge. Turley said most states have similar laws but rely on prosecutors to be selective in enforcing them. But that's a recipe for legal problems, he said. The issue drew international attention when a Georgia teen was sentenced to 10 years in prison for having consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old girl when he was 17. In 2005, Genarlow Wilson was tried for the rape of a 17-year-old girl at a hotel-room party. While he was found not guilty of that charge, he was convicted of aggravated child molestation for the act with the 15-year-old -- even though he was less than two years older. Georgia law, which has since been changed, required a mandatory 10-year sentence on the charge of aggravated child molestation and required Wilson to register as a sex offender when he was released. Under the revised Georgia law, the act now would be a misdemeanor. Now 21, Wilson was released from prison in October -- after serving more than two years -- when the state Supreme Court ruled his sentence was \"grossly disproportionate to his crime.\" \"The current laws leave too much to prosecutorial discretion,\" Turley said. \"We saw in the Wilson case how prosecutorial discretion can lead to grotesque results.\" He said statutory rape prosecutions of teens are more common in Southern states and small towns than they are elsewhere in the country or in big cities. B.J. Bernstein, Wilson's attorney, argued throughout his case that Wilson was imprisoned for an act that, while perhaps morally questionable, probably is going on among teens everywhere. \"If you prosecuted, even with misdemeanors, all those cases, you'd clog up the justice system with kids having sex,\" she said. \"It's a social issue -- and it may be something that parents don't want to happen or wish wouldn't happen at that age -- but it shouldn't be a crime.\" Spears, who turned 16 on April 4 and says she is 12 weeks into her pregnancy, told the magazine she plans to raise her child in Louisiana, \"so it can have a normal family life.\" Nickelodeon released a statement saying the network respects Spears' decision \"to take responsibility in this sensitive and personal situation.\" E-mail to a friend .", "eb2fe21af9629392d61a4fabe6cad72130525f2f": "NEW DELHI, India -- Police covered up the murder of a British teenage girl in Goa last month to protect the tourist industry, a state minister and local media said Monday. Scarlett Keeling stands on Anjuna beach in Goa a few days before her death. Officers had initially said Scarlett Keeling had drowned on Anjuna beach after taking drugs, but changed their story when the 15-year-old's mother protested and a second autopsy suggested she had been raped and murdered. A suspect in the case was arrested Sunday but Fiona MacKeown said she did not believe he was the man who killed her daughter. \"This is a clear case of murder and it has gone out of proportion because the police tried to cover it up,\" Francisco X. Pacheco, Goa's Tourism Minister told Reuters.com. Indian media suggested the cover-up was an attempt to protect Goa's tourism industry. \"They should have arrested this man a long time ago and this issue would have got diluted, but now because of the tainted image of some police officers in the case, things have gone out of hand,\" Pacheco said. Police said they were investigating allegations of a cover-up and the actions of junior officers. \"There are certain things under my scrutiny and I have taken cognizance of all these issues, specially these officers,\" Kishan Kumar, a senior police officer overseeing the probe told Reuters. Keeling's mother said she also believed police were trying to cover up the truth behind her daughter's murder, and that they had arrested Samson D'Souza, 29, to make it look like they were making progress in the case. \"We've had an awful lot of contact with people that have been in this situation before, and they've warned us to be careful (that) the police will try and find someone immediately to try and put a front on it that they're actually doing something,\" Fiona MacKeown told BBC radio on Monday. Kumar described D'Souza as a \"local Anjuna boy\" who was a bartender at Liu's, a beachfront bar. He said police had confirmed D'Souza's role in Keeling's rape and were now trying to find evidence that he killed the teenager. \"We have sufficient evidence to show that he was involved in rape,\" Kumar told CNN. \"So far as murder is concerned, we are investigating further.\" Scarlett and her family arrived in November for an extended vacation in Goa, known for its white sandy beaches and dance music scene. Beachfront shacks house the bars that fuel the nightlife. MacKeown said Scarlett was left in the care of a trusted male friend and his aunts while the rest of the family traveled to an adjoining Indian state, but she told the BBC that she has had no contact with the family since her daughter's death. The mother said Monday she sent a letter to Goa's chief minister asking for India's Central Bureau of Investigation to look into the case. Goa is popular with Western tourists but several tourists have died from drug overdoses in recent years while women have been attacked and sexually assaulted.

Brazilian genius Kaka fully deserves winning the 2007 World Footballer of the Year award. The prestigious Ballon d'Or award is widely regarded as the most prestigious individual prize in football and Kaka's inclusion on its coveted roll of honor is a testament to the 25-year-old Brazilian's current standing in world football. When AC Milan defeated Liverpool in the Champions League final in Athens, avenging their heartbreaking loss to the same team in Istanbul two years previously, it enabled Kaka to fulfill his dream of holding aloft Europe's premier trophy -- a winner's medal he fully deserved after a sublime 90-minute performance. Kaka's stock for both club and country has risen steadily since his move to the San Siro from Sao Paulo for a fee of just $8.5 million in the summer of 2003. Unlike many a Brazilian sporting genius, Kaka did not hone his skills on the beach or the streets of a favela shanty town. He was born into a comfortable middle class Brasilia family, where football was not the only hope of a bright future. However, it soon became clear that this particular boy had a very special skill and he was signed by Sao Paulo, after his family had moved there, at just eight years of age -- making his first team debut as an 18-year-old. Kaka's progress was soon picked up by his national team coach and Felipe Scolari named the graceful midfielder in his 23-man squad for the 2002 World Cup finals, earning him a winners' medal despite playing only 19 minutes of the tournament in a group match against Costa Rica. A year later, and Kaka was on his way to Milan. Within a month he had made the starting line-up and his 10 goals helped the Rossoneri lift the Scudetto and the European Super Cup. Throughout his career, Kaka has always possessed the innate ability to score goals -- his record for both club and country sees him average roughly a goal every three games. Yet to describe Kaka merely as a goalscoring midfielder would be doing him a massive injustice. Tall, elegant and blessed with astonishing skill, Milan and Brazil utilize Kaka's ability superbly. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti soon recognized Kaka's genius, changing his team's system to a 4-4-1-1, playing the Brazilian behind a main target man. With Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso holding the central midfield area, Kaka has a license to roam in behind the lone striker, be it Filippo Inzaghi, Ronaldo or Alberto Gilardino. And Kaka does this with devastating effect, running at the opposition with pace and power, finding defense-splitting passes or shooting from range with deadly accuracy be it from a dead-ball situation or open play. The fly in the ointment for Milan comes in the shape of their poor form this season. Although they have already reached the last 16 of the Champions League, the club are floundering in Serie A and face the unthinkable prospect of not qualifying for next season's competition unless they win the trophy. Real Madrid have coveted Kaka for the last two years -- expect the world transfer record to be smashed if Milan don't secure a place among Europe's elite.

Maria Lauterbach, according to police. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean, wanted for murder, may have fled to his native Mexico. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean is charged with first-degree murder. He remains at large, and authorities say he may have fled to Mexico. Also, an affidavit obtained Thursday by CNN states that Christina Laurean knew about the death one day before reporting it to authorities. The Marines were assigned to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach was eight months pregnant when she was reported missing December 19. Authorities say she was killed four days earlier. A warrant allowed authorities to search Western Union records. Authorities said in the accompanying affidavit that Cesar Laurean and his wife received a transfer of money between December 10 and January 12. The affidavit provided no other details. Authorities requested the search warrant and all accompanying documents be sealed. The FBI says Laurean may have fled to his native country of Mexico. Cesar Laurean, 21, is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He mailed at least one letter from Houston, Texas, since his disappearance, CNN affiliate KPRC in Houston reported Thursday. According to the affidavit, Christina Laurean, 25 -- who also is a Marine -- went with her husband to a Jacksonville attorney on January 10, and the lawyer told Cesar Laurean he could face the death penalty. The next day, Christina Laurean reported Lauterbach's death to the Onslow County Sheriff's Office, where she appeared with an attorney and a sergeant from her former chain of command. She turned over to deputies several notes from her husband that she said she found at their home. In the notes, Cesar Laurean said Lauterbach committed suicide and he buried her. Lauterbach, 20, had accused Cesar Laurean of raping her and was to testify at a military hearing not long after her disappearance. According to a co-worker, she feared Cesar Laurean, although the military said she told prosecutors she did not. Lauterbach's allegations involved two encounters -- one on or about March 26 and one approximately two weeks later, the Marines told CNN. Lauterbach received two protective orders, one of which was in effect when she died. Christina Laurean on January 11 told authorities her husband had denied the rape allegations and said he was not the baby's father, according to the affidavit. In the document she says her husband told her: . Dubois contends the facts show probable cause exists to show that Cesar Laurean \"committed murder.\" The detective said he doesn't believe Lauterbach committed suicide, especially because she had told people she wanted the child. Christina Laurean told police she was at a Christmas party for her husband's Marine unit during the late afternoon and evening of December 15, Onslow County Sheriff Ed Brown told CNN. Her husband did not attend the party, she told authorities. Lauterbach's charred remains and those believed to be of her unborn child were found in a fire pit in the Laureans' backyard. Police have said blood spatters were found throughout the Laurean home on walls and ceilings, and evidence showed someone tried to clean them up and paint over them. DNA testing is being conducted to see if Lauterbach's unborn baby was fathered by Cesar Laurean, Brown said, adding there was no rush on the part of detectives to get those results. The FBI is offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to Cesar Laurean's arrest. Anyone in Mexico with information is asked to contact the legal attache at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. Meanwhile, authorities have discovered the weapon likely used to kill Lauterbach, a spokesman for the Onslow County Sheriff's Office said Thursday. Authorities have said the woman died of blunt force trauma to the head. A man who had rented a room to Lauterbach, Sgt.

On a conference call with reporters, Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said it was clear Obama had \"lifted rhetoric\" from Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. Late Monday, Clinton followed up with a swipe of her own. \"If your whole candidacy is about words, then they should be your own words,\" Clinton said in Madison, Wisconsin. \"That's what I think.\" Obama downplayed the significance of the accusation. \"I've written two books, wrote most of my speeches. So I think putting aside the question ... in terms of whether my words are my own, I think that would be carrying it too far,\" Obama said. \"Deval and I do trade ideas all the time, and you know he's occasionally used lines of mine,\" Obama said. Obama said he also used some of Deval's words at a Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Wisconsin. \"I would add I've noticed on occasion Sen. Clinton has used words of mine as well,\" said Obama. \"As I said before, I really don't think this is too big of a deal.\" Obama campaign officials said Clinton had a pattern of borrowing from some of her rival's signature phrases, including \"Yes, We Can\" and \"Fired Up, Ready to Go.\" They circulated a YouTube video and list of these alleged instances to reporters. The Clinton campaign earlier pointed to similarities between the words of Obama and Patrick that have raised eyebrows and attracted traffic on YouTube. A central passage in a speech Obama gave Saturday -- aimed at convincing voters that his campaign is not just about lofty rhetoric -- is adapted from one that Patrick used in his 2006 campaign, the Obama campaign said when asked about it. The controversy is lost on the Massachusetts governor, who endorsed Obama. Obama's campaign had Patrick call the New York Times over the weekend and issue a statement. \"Senator Obama and I are long-time friends and allies. We often share ideas about politics, policy and language,\" Patrick said in the statement. \"The argument in question, on the value of words in the public square, is one about which he and I have spoken frequently before. Given the recent attacks from Senator Clinton, I applaud him responding in just the way he did.\"  Watch a comparison of Obama's and Patrick's speeches \u00bb . The Obama campaign also confirmed comments chief strategist David Axelrod -- an adviser on Obama's Senate campaign and Patrick's gubernatorial run -- made to the New York Times about the speeches. \"They often riff off one another. They share a world view,\" Axelrod told the Times about Obama and Patrick. \"Both of them are effective speakers whose words tend to get requoted and arguments tend to be embraced widely.\" Responding to attacks from Clinton that he offers words while she offers action, Obama has been arguing that words matter. Saturday night at a gala for the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Obama said to frequent applause, \"Don't tell me words don't matter! 'I have a dream.' Just words. 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.' Just words. 'We have nothing to fear but fear itself.' Just words, just speeches!\" In 2006, Patrick, fending off attacks from his rival Kerry Healey, told a crowd, \"Her dismissive point, and I hear it a lot from her staff, is all I have to offer is words. Just words. 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal' -- just words. Just words. 'We have nothing to fear but fear itself' -- just words. 'Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country' -- just words. 'I have a dream' -- just words.\" Clinton has argued that while Obama provides rousing speeches, she has the stronger grasp of the issues and the knowledge of how to use the presidency to start making changes from \"day one.\" Speaking last week at a General Motors plant in Ohio, she said, \"There's a big difference between us -- speeches versus solutions, talk versus action. You know, some people may think words are change. But you and I know better. Words are cheap. I know it takes work.\" E-mail to a friend .

They asked the community for help in solving the slayings. Police and fire units responded Monday after six people were killed in Memphis, Tennessee. Police found six people -- two men, two women and two boys -- dead in a home in a north Memphis neighborhood Monday, said Memphis police Lt. Joe Scott. Three other children who were wounded in the home were taken to a hospital. Scott did not release the names of the victims. He said there was no sign of forced entry into the home, and evidence at the scene indicated that the killer or killers left the house. Detectives were trying to determine the day of the killings, which could have occurred as early as Saturday, Scott said. He said police had not developed a suspect and need people to come forward with information. \"We need the community's help,\" he said. \"These were children that were brutally killed. We know that there are people out there that heard things, saw something. This is a stain on our community. We really need the community's help to solve this.\" The four dead adults were shot and the two dead children were stabbed, sources told CNN affiliate WMC-TV. The wounded children -- a 7-year-old boy, a 10-month-old girl and a 4-year-old whose gender wasn't immediately known -- were transported to Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center. They were treated for gunshot wounds, said hospital spokeswoman Jennilyn Utkov, who said she did not have any additional information about their conditions. At least one of the wounded children also was stabbed, police told the Commercial Appeal newspaper. The newspaper reported Tuesday that two of them were in very critical condition and one was in serious condition. A neighbor told CNN Tuesday that he heard gunshots coming from the house Saturday night. \"I heard about six or seven shots,\" said Wayne Bolden, a landscaper who said he lives across the street from the home where the killings occurred. \"I did not call the police because you always hear shooting in this neighborhood. Now I wish I would have called.\" He said he did not see any movement at the home the next day.  The two cars, a van and a passenger car, never moved. Monday, he saw many police cars at the home and heard about the killings, he said. Bolden said a family that included a man, a woman and five or six children moved into the home about five months ago. \"I did not know him by name,\" Bolden said of the man. \"But the kids were always out playing, and he would barbecue outside on his front porch.\" A prayer service was held for the victims Tuesday morning at the family's nearby church, said Keith Norman, senior pastor at First Baptist Church. He said he had been asked by the police to counsel the family members of the victims. Another prayer service was scheduled for 6 p.m., he said, and some of the victims' family members are expected to attend. \"There are multiple families affected by this,\" said Norman, who said he did not want to speak about what led to the killings. \"We are just praying for the family members and trying to help them get through this.\" Police do not know what was behind the violence, the Commercial Appeal newspaper reported. \"We just don't know the motive or cause of death, but we do have four adults and two children [dead],\" Memphis police Lt. Jerry Guin told the paper. Rob Robinson told the Commercial Appeal that he was the landlord for the brick, single-family house that rented for $550 per month. \"They were very nice, very polite to me,\" Robinson told the paper of the residents. \"It's kind of surprising, actually. I've never had any trouble with them, no damage to the property. They paid their rent and even helped with repairs and stuff.\" Neighbor Leo Baker told WMC-TV he has lived nearby for 10 years but did not know the residents of the home. \"It's sad you come home to find out something like this has gone on,\" Baker said. \"It's kind of sad, and scary too.\" Video footage showed emergency vehicles on the scene, with people embracing in rainy weather outside police tape surrounding the home. \"I've been on a scene where there were one or two or three [victims], but I don't remember anything this large,\" Guin told the Commercial Appeal. The newspaper reported that the shooting appeared to be the city's deadliest mass killing since 1973, when 28-year-old David Sanders randomly shot and killed five people before being shot dead by police. In 2000, police said firefighter Frederick Williams confessed to a shooting in Memphis in which four people were killed -- his wife, a sheriff's deputy and two fellow firefighters.

Police have more than one confession in the case and the individuals will be charged with murder, said Robert Parker, director of the Miami-Dade Police Department. The suspects were identified as Venjah K. Hunte, 20; Eric Rivera Jr., 17; Jason Scott Mitchell, 17; and Charles Kendrick Lee Wardlow, 18. Additional arrests are possible, Parker said. \"The key to solving this case was citizen's tips,\" he said. Taylor, 24, died Tuesday, a day after he was shot during an apparent burglary at his Miami home. The police investigation revealed the suspects thought the house was empty, Parker said. \"They were certainly not looking to go there and kill anyone,\" he said. \"They were expecting a residence that was not occupied, so murder or shooting someone was not their initial motive. ... Their obvious motive was to go there and steal the contents of the house.\" The men knew Taylor lived at the house, Parker said. At 1:45 a.m. Monday, Taylor's girlfriend, Jackie Garcia, called 911 and said someone had been shot. Authorities have said she told police she was hiding under the bedding during the attack. Garcia did not see what happened and could not provide a suspect description, Parker told reporters on Wednesday. Police said Garcia and Taylor were awakened by noise in the living room, and that Taylor got up and locked the bedroom door, but the door was kicked in and two shots were fired, one striking him in the leg. Garcia tried to call 911 but was unable to, and used her cell phone instead, police said. There was no evidence the line had been cut, Parker said Wednesday. A break-in was also reported eight days earlier, Miami-Dade police said. A police report said someone forced a window open and left a kitchen knife on a bed. Several drawers and a bedroom safe were searched during the break-in, according to the report. Taylor was home unexpectedly because of an injury, his former attorney, Richard Sharpstein, told reporters Tuesday. \"I think he was surprised or they were surprised to find him there,\" he said. Taylor spent four years with the Washington Redskins, but had been out with a sprained right knee. He did not play in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. Taylor was a first-round pick in the 2004 draft, according to his team's web site. He played at the University of Miami, where he was an All-American in 2003, and was also a high school standout in the city. Dubbing him \"the prototype NFL free safety,\" the Redskins credited Taylor's team-leading tackling prowess for sending him to his first Pro Bowl after 2006. He was regarded as one of the hardest hitting players in the league. Taylor recorded 257 tackles (206 solo) during his brief career, two sacks and seven interceptions. E-mail to a friend .

Now she is on death row, and all he can do is pray. Razeena Mohammad (left) and Mohammad Sultan Nafeek, parents of Rizana Nafeek. Rizana, who was 17 when she started work in Saudi Arabia, was convicted of killing a 4-month-old baby boy in her care just two weeks into her job. Nafeek says the child died accidentally, choking on milk. His daughter was sentenced to beheading in a case rights groups say underlines the vulnerability of many of the 1.5 million Sri Lankans who work abroad -- nearly 400,000 of them in Saudi Arabia alone. \"Our family was suffering hardship, and so our daughter volunteered to go and work abroad to send money home,\" Nafeek told Reuters by telephone from his modest home in Mutur in Sri Lanka's war-torn northeast. After the December 2004 tsunami forced them from their home, the family was displaced again by renewed civil war between the state and separatist Tamil Tiger rebels. Nafeek visited Saudi Arabia with Sri Lanka's deputy foreign minister this month in a bid to secure clemency and met with relations of the dead child's parents but came away empty handed. Under Saudi law, a pardon is the gift of the family of the victim, and so far the parents of the dead child have refused to meet either the family or Sri Lankan officials. \"The cops told us: 'Go and pray to Allah. If you can get the forgiveness of the parents, your daughter will be free,' \" he said. \"So I am praying all the time.\" \"If we had been able to meet the parents, we are sure they would have been willing to forgive our daughter after seeing our situation.\" The Sri Lankan government is investigating the agency that sent Rizana to work abroad when she was technically still a child but remains hopeful she will be pardoned or exonerated. \"I am fairly confident,\" said Deputy Foreign Minister Hussein Bhaila. \"We have spoken to tribal leaders of their particular tribe, we have spoken to area officials... It is they who will now have to speak (to the parents).\" \"His Excellency the President (Mahinda Rajapaksa) has been following this case very keenly. This is an exceptional case because of her tender age,\" he added. Rights groups accuse the government of failing to protect its expatriate workers -- one of the main sources of foreign-exchange revenues for the $23 billion economy -- with legal aid. They also decry Saudi Arabia's legal system. \"This case raises many troubling questions about the treatment of children and foreigners in Saudi Arabia's criminal-justice system,\" Human Rights Watch said in a statement issued overnight. \"International law prohibits the death penalty for crimes committed before the age of 18.\" Saudi Arabia executed four Sri Lankans convicted of armed robbery earlier this year, and did not inform Sri Lankan authorities beforehand. Sri Lanka reinstated its own death penalty in 2004 after the murder of a high court judge, but it has been dormant since 1976. There is no indication any of the dozens of convicted murderers, rapists and drug smugglers on death row in Sri Lanka and effectively serving life prison terms will actually be executed.

Leah Perry, who sent this photo of son Bobby and dog Rosie, thinks Vick should not be allowed back on the field. The plea deal may include prison time, but the NFL has not yet decided what football sanctions, if any, it should impose on Vick, a spokesman said. We asked CNN.com readers whether they thought Vick would -- or should -- play professional football again as well as their opinions on the case.  Below is a selection of those responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. Stephanie King of Arlington, Washington Michael Vick is a disgrace. For anyone thinking he should be let off easy for admitting his guilt -- think again. The only reason he did that was because he knew the evidence against him was so great. Remember only shortly ago he was stating vehemently that he \"only owned\" the property and had no idea what was going on there. It wasn't until the eyewitness accounts were brought to light that he \"apologized.\" One cannot be \"sorry\" for torturing and killing animals. As you know it's been proven that those with the ability to do so also have a stronger chance of being abusive to humans. How can we allow someone like that to be a role model for children? If we do we're degrading our society and shame on us. Patricia Reese of Paola, Kansas Yes, I think Mr. Vick should be allowed to play football again. He is a talented individual and it would be a shame to waste that talent. I also believe he should be able to rebuild his life. However, as part of his restitution to society, I believe he should contribute at least 40% of his salary for what could have potentially been his maximum jail sentence to the Humane Society to help abused and abandoned animals. Debbie Clayton of Greensboro, North Carolina He should never be allowed to play [in the] NFL or earn a dime associated with the NFL. He should be made to work so many hours per week, every week, at minimum wage at an Animal Shelter. Jeff Wise of Atlanta, Georgia Why not give him a chance to play again? Seriously how many chances has the NFL given to Ricky Williams? Smoking pot is against the law, but he's been given a number of chances, and STILL isn't banned from the NFL! Jeremy Montgomery of Mount Laurel, New Jersey I think that Vick should not be allowed to step on the field again and any endorsement deals revoked. What he did was reprehensible. He is in a spotlight where he should be held at a higher standard for a role model. Josh Hebert of Loganville, Georgia He should take whatever punishment our government gives him, but when he has done his time (if he does do time) he should be able to continue playing football. The charges against him are not football related in any way. Angela Ziegler of Cleveland, Ohio The NFL needs to \"step up to the plate\" and be the man that Michael Vick is not. Allowing him in their league gives a signal that animal abuse is OK with them. Remember Jeffrey Dahmer started as an animal abuser! Want him as your role model or a spokesman? Kelly Koch of Holland, Michigan The NFL and all sponsors should refrain from any future contact with Michael Vick. I, for one, will boycott those with future dealings with him. John Robinson of Redmond, Washington Pro athletes are constantly getting in trouble with the law. Unless we make a policy that all players who are convicted of a felony are banned from the league, then Vick should be allowed to play after a suspension. Randy Jonson of Stamford, Connecticut Until I know the depth of the gambling angle it's hard to be certain. Dog fighting is brutal but if it's only dog fighting/killing, he should get whatever the feds give him and be able to return to football once his debt is paid. Bill Saray of Derby, Connecticut Vick should never play again. He wasn't the best QB to begin with. Anyone with such a blatant disregard for life -- animal or human -- is not worthy of the position in life he was given. Playing in the NFL is not a right. As such, the league should ban him permanently, while society should shun him publicly. If only scarlet letters were still around. Todd Morrison of Howell, Michigan Mr. Vick should be judged of his crime. Not by his fame, nor his race. He should be prosecuted as a person. I believe Mr. Vick's NFL playing days should be determined by the NFL commissioner with consideration of the NFL's personal conduct policy. This is how everyone should be treated in America. Everyone is equal regardless of popularity, fame, and race. Lance G. of Dearborn Heights, Michigan First off, I am an African-American ... this is NOT a race issue. I wish the ignorant people here in the U.S. would get off that tip. This is not an issue to raise the \"race\" card. Even his so-called homies (who were all black) turned on him. Vick ... committed a felony and now he has to pay for it. He should have chosen a better hobby in life than dog fighting. As for playing football ... he should be banned from the league for at least 2 to 3 years, including his jail time. Leah Perry of Chelmsford, Massachusetts I don't think Vick should be allowed to play football, nor should he get off easy. After he serves his sentence, I think he should work at the MSPCA [to] make him see what cruelty to animals really looks like in all aspects. Steven Todd of Fort Wayne, Indiana I think Michael Vick will play football again, though at what level is anybody's guess. I do not think he should be banned for life. He may have gambled, but not on the game as Pete Rose did. A suspension is in order and I think a year would be fair, but a prison term and suspension would put him out of football for up to three years, and who knows what kind of QB he will be after this ordeal and so long an absence? Jennifer Runyan of Fayetteville, North Carolina I think the whole Michael Vick case is disgusting. The NFL needs to ban him permanently. He shouldn't be able to use the obscene amount of money he makes to torture innocent animals. Kids looked up to him and how many of them will think that abuse is OK now? I don't think he deserves to play ever again. I applaud the people sending Michael Vick jerseys into the Atlanta Humane Society to use cleaning the kennels, now that's appropriate! Watch what a dog thinks of his Vick jersey . Debbie Connor of Whitesville, Kentucky No, he should not be granted the right to play pro football again! He was given the \"Golden\" key to a life of fame and riches and he blew it away. He should be working for the road department, picking up \"Road Kill\" off the streets! Julio Hernandez of Kalamazoo, Michigan He needs to be banned from the NFL forever. These \"men\" are role models for the youth of this country. What kind of message would we be sending to them if we were to let him play in the NFL again? Not a good one, I can tell you that much. He's through. And if he's not, I certainly won't be watching any Falcons games, or for that matter any team he may eventually play for. Nichelle Williams of Woodbridge, Virginia If Imus is going to return back to the air ... then Vick should return to the field. You violate some people or beings; you apologize, let the air clear and go on with business as usual! John Brandon of Old Hickory, Tennessee To make a long story short -- my family will never watch a game with Michael Vick in attendance.

But Richard Branson did just that, setting up a magazine and then entering the record business. Now his brand is behind more than 300 companies -- from cola to trains, from phones to planes making Virgin a global name. Soon Virgin will reach galactic proportions. In 2009 Richard Branson hopes to take tourists into space. CNN's Todd Benjamin caught up with the billionaire in London and asked what drives him to create such a diverse enterprise. Branson: What drives me to create a lot of different businesses is simply a feeling that we can, most likely, do it better than other people in particular areas. We won't create a business if somebody else is doing it really well, the only time we'll create one is if it's not being done well. Benjamin: How would you describe your own personality? Branson: I love people, I love to learn. I never went to university so I see my life as one long university education I never had. I'm very inquisitive, hence the fact we've gone to 350 different businesses, which is quite unusual for a western company. Benjamin: You run your companies as a series of independent companies. What do you look for in your key lieutenants? Branson: Number one, the Virgin brand is absolutely paramount, they must do nothing to damage the reputation of the brand. And the second thing is to look after their team of people. Benjamin: Your headmaster when you left high school said to you ''Branson, congratulations, I predict you'll either go to prison or become a millionaire.'' What was it in your character that you think made him make that observation? Branson: Well I suspect the fact that at age 13 I'm writing him letters on how he could organize the catering better and how the school could save money, and if they save money they could then put it into better facilities for the students. And I managed to persuade him to give me a study to start my magazine and it was only when he actually finally came to me and said \"Look, you're either going to have to do your school work or your magazine,\" that I said \"Well, goodbye. I'm off to do the magazine, but thanks very much.\" Benjamin: In your autobiography you write about being four-years-old and your mother stops the car and makes you get out and what does she make you do? Branson: We were on the way to my grandmother's house in Devon, and I think about three miles before we got there she made me get out and told me to find my own way to my grandmother's house. Basically, her approach was to try and get us to stand on our own two feet and she went to extreme measures sometimes to do so. Benjamin: Without your persona do you think the Virgin brand could have ever become what it became? Branson: I think the particular Virgin brand perhaps needed me, in the past, to get out there and be adventurous, and therefore to give the brand an adventurous feeling; take on the big guys, which we did, and beat the big guys and that's what's created the Virgin brand. I think now if my balloon pops, or the space ship just continues to go into space, or whatever, I think the brand is strong enough to withstand all that and it'll continue to grow.

All the same, from the New Year enjoying a cigarette while you sip on your cafe au lait will become a thing of the past. From January 1 it will be illegal in France to smoke in cafes as well as clubs, casinos and hotels. France is extending its ban on smoking to include bars, discotheques, restaurants, hotels, casinos, as well as its fabled cafes. In a country renowned for its fondness for romance, smoking has never quite shaken off its romantic associations with smoky Left Bank cafes and waifish Parisienne beauties clutching on a Gauloises. In spite of the health dangers, about 13.5 million people smoke out of a population of 60 million with around 26 percent of 15 year olds estimated to smoke, according to 2002 figures from the World Health Organization. A smoking ban was first introduced in France in February this year to cover workplaces, schools, airports and hospitals. The new restrictions will only apply to the inside of premises, meaning smokers are still free to light up on the terraces. Even so, enforcing the ban may prove tricky in a country well known for its cafe culture. To soften the blow, the authorities have agreed to an amnesty over the New Year holiday and will not fully enforce the new arrangements until Wednesday. After that time, any smoker caught will face a fine of \u20ac450 ($662), while hotel and bar owners who fail to prevent smokers from lighting up on their premises will be fined \u20ac750 ($1,100). France has lagged behind many of its European neighbors in bringing in legislation to curb smoking in public places. Ireland became the first European country to introduce a comprehensive smoking ban in 2004. Since then Italy, Spain, Belgium and Britain have followed suit with similar bans.

A grand jury identified Eric Rivera Jr. as the shooter in the death of NFL star Sean Taylor. Court documents say the youngest is alleged to have fired the fatal shot. He is identified as Eric Rivera Jr., 17. He appeared briefly on Wednesday morning before a judge in Miami, Florida. Rivera has been indicted as an adult and Judge John Thornton found probable cause to support charges of first degree felony murder and burglary with assault or battery with a firearm. Three other suspects -- Venjah K. Hunte, 20, Jason Scott Mitchell, 19, and Charles Kendrick Lee Wardlow, 18 -- appeared Tuesday in court via videoconference. They wore thick green vests, which defense attorneys said were suicide safety smocks.

A memorial stone recalls the place of the Munich air disaster in Kirchtrudering near Munich. Eight players lost their lives on February 6, 1958, when Flight 609 ZU crashed on the third attempt to take off after re-fuelling in Germany as United returned from knocking Red Star Belgrade out of the European Cup. Sir Matt Busby's side, back-to-back English champions and well positioned for a hat-trick attempt, were arguably on course to become the best United team. The United players killed at Munich were Geoff Bent, aged 25, Roger Byrne(28), Eddie Colman (21),  Mark Jones (24), David Pegg (22), Tommy Taylor (26), Liam Whelan (22) and 21-year-old Duncan Edwards who died in hospital 15 days after the crash. They and the other 15 people who lost their lives will be remembered with a commemorative service at Old Trafford while a short ceremony, organised by supporters, will also take place at the memorial site in Kirchtrudering, on the outskirts of Munich. In keeping with tradition, United supporters will also gather under the memorial plaque at Old Trafford where the clock is fixed at the exact time of the final fateful take-off attempt. Later in the day, a minute's silence will take place ahead of England's friendly with Switzerland at Wembley as a further mark of respect. As he bows his head during this week's Munich commemorations, survivor  Harry Gregg's mind will understandably flash back to that snow-laden runway, but only briefly. The 75-year-old Ulsterman prefers not to remember the afternoon he lost so many friends among the victims, but instead the days when the dream of the 'Busby babes' was still vibrant and alive. Goalkeeper Gregg, hailed a hero in the wake of the crash after returning to the wreckage to pull out survivors, is adamant those are the times which always burn brightest in his memory. \"I was part of something that was a very, very beautiful thing at that time,\" said Gregg, who cost United a record 23,000 pounds sterling when he joined from Doncaster Rovers two months before the disaster. \"I'll always be proud of that. The fact there's going to be a minute's silence after 50 years is a tribute to the people I played with, but one must remember as well there were other people on board that aircraft, a lot more people. \"I want the minute's silence to be over and then I want to remember the happy times, that's what I want the world to remember, that's what I want the families to remember.\" E-mail to a friend .", "ab2d99eedfd685ce685fa44e735695c27e946683": "(CNN) -- The presidents of Sudan and Chad signed a non-aggression agreement late Thursday, aiming to halt cross-border hostilities between the two African nations. Chad President Idriss Deby, right, and Sudan's President Omar al-Beshir, left, shake hands after signing the pact. The signing came after nearly two full days of talks in Dakar, Senegal, between Sudan President Omar al-Beshir and Idriss Deby, the president of Chad. Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade facilitated the talks, and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon met with officials from both nations and witnessed the signing of the agreement at about 10 p.m. \"The idea is to get the governments of Sudan and Chad to normalize their relations with each other and to halt any action that would allow for the cross-border movement of rebel factions or armed factions of either side that could hurt the other country,\" said United Nations spokesman Farhan Haq. Each country accuses the other of supporting armed rebel groups that cross the border to attempt to destabilize the government. The rival nations' armies have skirmished several times. The United Nations says refugees and armed groups have been regularly crossing the border between the troubled Darfur region of Sudan and Chad. They allegedly include many of the rebels that attacked N'Djamena, the capital of Chad, in early February. As recently as Thursday, just hours before the agreement was signed, Chad issued a communique saying rebels from Sudan had crossed the border. Chad is still recovering from a failed attempt last month by rebels to overthrow Deby's regime. The United Nations says the swelling number of Darfur refugees and other displaced people living in eastern Chad is causing serious strain on the region. Kingsley Amaning, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Chad, said more than 10,000 people from Darfur, in Sudan, have fled into 12 official refugee camps in eastern Chad. They join some 240,000 Darfurians who have lived in Chad since 2004 because of fighting in their homeland and an estimated 180,000 displaced Chadians also living there. The number of displaced Chadians is growing because of the recent fighting there, Kingsley said. Haq said the United Nations, which has peacekeeping troops in the Darfur region, will work to assure Sudan and Chad carry out the terms of Thursday's deal. The countries have signed several peace agreements in the past, only to see renewed violence flare up. E-mail to a friend .", "df9c4e1b8698581720b28c71f1e98f82bd6ea6e6": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Larry Craig filed an appeal Monday in his continued legal fight stemming from a bathroom sex sting this summer. Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, initially said he would resign at the end of September but then changed his mind. The Idaho Republican wants the Minnesota Court of Appeals to overturn a judge's decision refusing to let him withdraw a guilty plea to misdemeanor charges stemming from his arrest in June. \"From the outset Senator Craig has maintained that he is innocent of any illegal conduct at the Minneapolis airport,\"  Craig's lawyer, Billy Martin, said in a written statement. \"Like every other citizen, Senator Craig has the constitutional right to make every effort to clear his name.\" Martin called the judge's decision \"a manifest injustice.\" In an interview Sunday with Boise, Idaho, TV station KTVB, Craig said \"we don't know what the appellate court will say to me,\" according to the station's Web site.  Watch Craig discuss his chances on the appeal \u00bb . \"Honestly, the appeals courts tend to defend the courts below them. It is my right to do what I'm doing. I've already provided for Idaho [the] certainty that Idaho needed, I'm not running for re-election. I'm no longer in the way. I am pursuing my constitutional rights.\" The appeals process could take months to complete, court spokesman Kyle Christopherson said. Craig entered a guilty plea after his arrest in a men's room at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport for allegedly propositioning a plainclothes police officer for sex. Craig originally said he would resign from the Senate on September 30 if he could not get the guilty plea withdrawn. He later postponed his decision until the judge ruled. After an October 4 ruling against him, Craig changed course, saying he would not resign and would continue to pursue his legal options. \"I am innocent of the charges against me,\" he said at the time. The Idaho lawmaker's decision not to resign has created a political headache for the Senate's Republican leadership. When news of the arrest first surfaced, GOP leaders called for an investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee. They later applauded Craig's decision to resign. And when Craig announced that he would continue to serve in the Senate, GOP leaders did not appear pleased. \"It's embarrassing for the Senate. It's embarrassing for our party,\" said Sen. John Ensign of Nevada, who leads the GOP's Senate campaign committee, on the day of the judge's decision. \"I think it's best for the U.S. Senate, it's best for certainly his party, that he just keeps his word.\" Romney accused . In an interview taped Sunday with NBC's Matt Lauer, Craig complained that GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney \"threw me under the campaign bus\" when news of his arrest came out. \"He not only threw me under his campaign bus, he backed up and ran over me again,\" Craig told Lauer in the interview set to run Tuesday night, according to MSNBC.com. Romney, former governor of Massachusetts, called Craig's behavior \"disgraceful\" and urged the senator to resign when news of the arrest broke in August. Craig was Romney's Senate liaison before resigning from the campaign. Romney spokesman Kevin Madden defended the presidential candidate's response. \"Gov. Romney simply believes that a public office is a public trust,\" Madden said. \"He believes when a public official enters a guilty plea, they have broken that public trust and should step aside for the sake of their constituents.\" Also in the Lauer interview, Craig and his wife, Suzanne, denied that their marriage is a cover for his homosexuality, according to MSNBC.com. \"People know me and know that I would never do that,\" said Suzanne Craig, MSNBC.com reported. \"That's almost like selling your soul for something.\" The senator has denied he is gay. \"I love this woman very, very much,\" Larry Craig said, according to MSNBC.com. \"The day I found her, I fell deeply in love. And we're heading toward our 25th anniversary.\" When she learned the story was going to break, Suzanne Craig said, \"I felt like the floor was falling out from under me. ...

A general view of the new Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport prior to its official opening on Friday. The British monarch, who also opened Heathrow's first passenger terminal in 1955, was present under strict security a day after a man carrying a backpack was arrested for running onto a runway at the airport. The first flights from the new terminal are scheduled for March 27. Its opening has come after 15 years of planning and construction by its owners BAA -- and protests by local residents and environmental groups. It is part of a strategy which could lead to passenger numbers almost doubling to 122 million a year, with a sixth terminal and a third runway in the pipeline despite some vociferous opposition. Spanish-owned BAA, which also runs Gatwick and Stansted in Britain, also plans to eventually demolish Terminals 1 and 2 and replace them in a project called Heathrow East.  Watch Queen Elizabeth meet airport staff. \u00bb . Residents were once told by BAA that there would be no fifth terminal, but the company is planning to forge further ahead despite the concerns of environmental groups. \"Terminal 5 stands as a monument to the binge-flying culture this Government has done so much to encourage,\" Greenpeace transport campaigner Anita Goldsmith told the UK Press Association. \"It's part of an obsession with expansion which can only mean more flights, more emissions and more climate change.\" Richard Dyer of Friends of the Earth added: \"If the Government is serious about tackling climate change, the opening of Terminal 5 must mark the end of airport expansion in Britain. \"Further expansion of Heathrow would be environmentally irresponsible and isn't necessary for the economy of London.\" However, business groups welcomed the expansion at Heathrow. \"Thriving, growing airports are vital to help maintain Britain's economic competitiveness,\" Neil Pakey, chairman of the Airport Operators' Association, told PA. \"Domestic air links to Heathrow are particularly valuable for the regional economies, and this new terminal will undoubtedly provide them with a much-needed boost.

Khiel Coppin's brother Joel Coppin spoke briefly with reporters saying, \"We want justice.\" Authorities were responding to a 9-1-1 call his mother made about a \"family dispute with a gun,\" police said. In the background of the call, played at a news conference Tuesday, 18-year-old Khiel Coppin can be heard saying, \"I've got a gun, I've got a gun,\" New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne told CNN. The teen put an object under his shirt and told his mother around the time she phoned 9-1-1 that he was going to say he had a gun, said New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. The teen told her, \" 'I'm prepared to die,' \" Kelly told reporters. When authorities arrived at the Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment, the teenager had something stuffed under his shirt and several times showed a knife to police. \"Shoot me, kill me,\" he shouted, according to Kelly. \"Come get me. I have a gun. Let's do this.\" Coppin ignored repeated commands to stop and get on the ground. Witnesses said the teen appeared to be holding an object underneath his shirt and pointed it at the officers. Coppin continued to approach officers, as they ordered him to stop, said Kelly. Twenty shots were fired; Coppin was struck eight times, Kelly said. \"This was a terrible tragedy for Khiel's family, no doubt about it,\" said Kelly. But the commissioner stressed that officers reasonably believed they were about to receive fire. Kelly said the teen's mother reported he had not taken his anti-depressant and anti-psychotic medication. Police have not recovered a gun and do not believe that Coppin was armed, Kelly said. A reporter asked Kelly if it's possible the young man was goading police to shoot him, a phenomenon known commonly in law enforcement circles as suicide-by-cop. \"That's certainly a possibility,\" said Kelly. \"The boy didn't have no gun, he had a brush on him,\" said Andre Wildman, a neighbor who told CNN that he saw the shooting.  Listen to mother's 911 call \u00bb . Another neighbor, Wayne Holder, said police should be required to see a weapon before opening fire on a suspect. \"At least see a gun before you start to discharge it,\" Holder said. Police \"don't even have to see it, [if] they think you got one, you're going to get shot.\" Coppin was taken to a hospital where he was declared dead. An autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday, the medical examiner's office said. The Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network is expected to hold a news conference on Tuesday about the shooting. Police said they were investigating whether Coppin had a history of mental illness and whether his mother had tried to have him hospitalized earlier Monday. The shooting came a year after unarmed groom Sean Bell, 23, was killed hours before his wedding in a shooting involving New York police. In 1999, unarmed African immigrant Amadou Diallo, 22, died when police in the Bronx shot him 19 times. Bystander Dyshawn Gibson described Monday's shooting to CNN affiliate WABC-TV. \"He dropped the brush,\" Gibson said. \"He put his hands up. Police just started firing.\" Coppin was seen pacing around the apartment prior to the shooting, according to an initial police statement issued Monday night. \"He began screaming from the window at his mother and the police,\" the police statement said. \"At some point, the male climbed out of the window and began crossing the sidewalk toward the police.\" That's when police began firing, a police spokesman said.

In the past 40 years, roughly 20 percent of the Amazon rainforest has been wiped out. \"The wealth of biodiversity is so immense, we cannot even estimate the amount we don't know,\" says Cl\u00e1udio C. Maretti, Brazil-based director for conservation for the World Wildlife Fund. \"Every new expedition you do to the Amazon, you might find one new species of fish. Every other, you might find some new bird or frog.\" The Amazon rainforest, which encompasses an area nearly as large as the continental United States and stretches across nine countries, is considered the world's richest and most varied natural habitat, with several million species of insects, plants, birds and fish calling it home. It also plays an important role in regulating Earth's temperature as its dense vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen into the air. But the Amazon has been under pressure from outside forces for decades. In the past 40 years, roughly 20 percent of the rainforest has been wiped out. Maretti says an additional 17 percent has been degraded to varying degrees. \"We have been deforesting at enormous rates,\" Maretti says. The chief drivers of this deforestation are large-scale business interests involved in logging, mining, agriculture and, especially, cattle ranching. Some of this activity is sanctioned by the government; much of it is not. Greenpeace estimates as much as 80 percent of the logging is illegal. The Amazon rainforest is just one of many habitats around the world threatened by encroaching development or natural resource extraction. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations estimates that 50,000 square miles of forest -- more than three times the size of Switzerland -- are lost each year because of clearing and degradation. The threat is particularly acute in the more tropical areas of South America, Africa and Southeast Asia. Cambodia, for example, lost nearly 30 percent of its primary forests from 2000 to 2005, according to FAO. Vietnam lost close to 55 percent of its primary forests, FAO found. And Nigeria lost nearly 56 percent of its primary forests over the same period, the worst rate of forest loss in the world, according to FAO. The destruction of the Earth's oldest and richest forests is not a new phenomenon, but the rate of destruction has increased in recent decades. \"Worldwide, one-half of all forests we've lost in the last 10,000 years has occurred in the last 80 years. Half of that was destroyed in the last 30 years,\" says Scott Paul, Forest Campaign Coordinator for Greenpeace. Paul says the chief driver of forest destruction is the buying and selling of forest products and farm products in the international market, not to meet local needs. \"The timber market, and also for agriculture, mining: When it plugs into the international economic system, that's when you've got to watch it,\" he says. Paul would like to see a certification system so that consumers know the source and conditions under which the product they're consuming was harvested. \"If you buy wine and cheese, we can tell the region and the year. But forest products have always been cut in remote and distant areas and thrown in a pipe and spit out on the other side. There is no way to determine if something came from a well-managed forest or an illegal forest where there is slavery, murder, drug trade, etc.,\" he says. While the story of the world's old-growth forests would appear to be one of unremitting destruction, forests lost to logging and agriculture are actually growing back in some areas, such as the northeast region of the United States and parts of Europe. This thrills some wildlife advocates who would like to see the restoration of exiled or decimated species. \"Northern New England is the only place in the eastern United States where you have the potential for large-scale wilderness where wolves, lynxes, cougars, woodland caribou and salmon rivers could be restored,\" according to Michael J. Kellett, executive director of RESTORE: The North Woods. \"We could literally have almost the entire ecosystem of the Maine woods as it once was.\" With large-scale agriculture all but gone from New England and logging companies concentrating their attention elsewhere, Kellett's biggest fear is that real estate development could begin to carve up the vast forests of Maine. His proposed solution: create a national park. In Brazil in recent years, the government reportedly has stepped up efforts to slow the Amazon's destruction. Last October, Brazil said the rate of deforestation plunged 41 percent because of the enforcement of environmental laws. Environmental groups say the drop also was caused by the fall of soy prices and the rise of Brazil's currency against the dollar, making the country's exports more expensive. The World Wildlife Fund's Maretti is hopeful that Brazil, with international help, will be able to protect even more of the Amazon, an area he considers among the most vital natural habitats in the world. \"We do have strong civil society. We do have more governance,\" Maretti says. \"But we certainly need support from abroad. I don't believe Brazil can do this job alone.\" E-mail to a friend .", "c26f356dc536e5797ba550be6e27a95059f1ce53": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States imposed stiff sanctions against Iran on Thursday, targeting two Iranian military groups and a number of Iranian banks and people it accuses of backing nuclear proliferation and terror-related activities. \"What this means is that no U.S. citizen or private organization will be allowed to engage in financial transactions with these persons and entities,\" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said. \"In addition, any assets that these designees have under U.S. jurisdiction will be immediately frozen.\" Rice and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson made the announcement in a brief appearance before reporters on Thursday morning. Rice accused Iran of \"pursuing nuclear technologies that can lead to a nuclear weapon; building dangerous ballistic missiles; supporting Shia militants in Iraq and terrorists in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories; and denying the existence of a fellow member of the United Nations, threatening to wipe Israel off the map.\"  Watch Rice tell why sanctions are being imposed \u00bb . \"Many of the Iranian regime's most destabilizing policies are carried out by two of its agencies: the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or the IRGC, and the Quds force, an arm of the IRGC,\" she said. She said the sanctions were being imposed \"because of the Revolutionary Guard's support for proliferation and the Quds force support for terrorism.\" The United States also designated three Iranian state-owned banks for sanctions, two of them \"for their involvement in proliferation activities\" and the other \"as a terrorist financier,\" Rice said. \"Iran funnels hundreds of millions of dollars each year through the international financial system to terrorists,\" Paulson said. \"Iran's banks aid this conduct using a range of deceptive financial practices intended to evade even the most stringent risk management controls.\" The Revolutionary Guard Corps, he said, \"is so deeply entrenched in Iran's economy and commercial enterprises, it is increasingly likely that, if you are doing business with Iran, you are doing business\" with the corps. \"We call on responsible banks and companies around the world to terminate any business with Bank Melli, Bank Mellat, Bank Saderat, and all companies and entities\" of the corps, Paulson said. The move marks the first time the United States has attempted to punish another country's military through sanctions. Previous sanctions imposed by the United States have been tied to Iran's nuclear program. The United States has been working with other world powers to halt what they believe is Iran's intent to develop a nuclear arsenal. Iran says it is pursuing nuclear power for peaceful reasons. Mohamed ElBaradei, director-general of the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency, said last month that Iran's declared nuclear material has not been diverted from peaceful use and criticized U.S. rhetoric regarding Iran. The Quds Force is blamed by the U.S. military for training and arming Shiite militias in Iraq and smuggling highly lethal explosives into Iraq, where they are used to attack coalition forces. Iran denies the charge. \"If the Iranian government fulfills its international obligation to suspend its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activity, I will join my British, French, Russian, Chinese and German colleagues, and I will meet with my Iranian counterpart any time, anywhere,\" Rice said. \"We will be open to the discussion of any issue. But if Iran's rulers choose to continue down a path of confrontation, the United States will act with the international community to resist these threats of the Iranian regime.\" Last month, representatives of world powers announced that unless a November report shows a \"positive outcome\" of talks with Iran about its uranium enrichment program, they will move ahead with plans for a resolution imposing additional sanctions on the country. The U.N. Security Council has repeatedly demanded that Iran suspend enrichment of uranium and has imposed limited sanctions on Tehran for refusing to comply.

Member of Sharjah royal family and one of Forbes' 100 most powerful women, Sheikha Lubna took the post of minister for economy and planning of United Arab Emirates in 2004. Her background is in IT and before the government appointment worked at the Dubai Ports Authority where she gained the \"Distinguished Government Employee Award\" in 1999 for developing a documentation system that reduced cargo turnaround from one hour to ten minutes. In 2000, Sheikha Lubna founded Tejari, the first Middle Eastern business-to-business marketplace. As a result of Tejari (Arabic for commerce) 70 percent of Dubai's government purchases are made online, while only 30 percent of bureaucrats were web-literate before its launch. One of the cornerstones of Sheikha Lubna's work has been to allow for foreign ownership, so when John Defterios met up with her, he began by asking her about her upcoming strategy. Sheikha Lubna: We are looking with scrutiny at the companies a lot at the moment and we have several sectors. We will evaluate each sector, from the service side, finance, accounting. And any sector that we believe we need further development in terms of economic growth, then we will focus on that: on increasing the acquisition or the ownership of the foreign company. Defterios: If you look at the Middle East, specifically within this Gulf region, it's quite a radical change to open up specific sectors to majority foreign ownership. Is this society in the region ready for this move? Sheikha Lubna: Interestingly, the United Arab Emirates is host to 80 percent of its population coming from outside. We host 200 nationalities, so for us, the contribution to the economy has already started over 15 years ago with the existence of the expatriate community. So in many ways I think the openness is only a natural path: it's an organic path to continue the openness that exists. Foreign direct investment is not your own wealth. When you have your own wealth, you have a tendency to be complacent sometimes, because it's your money and you may not think you need to actually strengthen your infrastructure. However, if you look at foreign direct investment, it mandates you to be much more transparent, you have to be very diligent about your work, and it also creates new knowledge coming into the country and you can create more development through employment. Defterios: It's interesting, you read the front line of the DP World, P&O acquisition and the furor it created in the United States particularly within Congress. What are the lessons, not just from the UAE perspective, but the lessons learned from both sides during that whole process? Sheikha Lubna: First of all, I think it is important to understand, in this global world, there is a circulation of funds and there is excess of wealth that has to go somewhere. Liquidity of markets sometimes means you invest internally or you invest abroad. We've learned a lesson being in the oil crises earlier that you need to diversify your money and look into investment abroad. And we've seen this where the UAE invests in the Far East, Australia, Asia as well as in Europe and the United States. What's more important to understand is that if you're going to lock up your interest in terms of selling either because of protectionism or a particular idea in your mind that I don't want to sell to this particular organization versus another, there are other places. Defterios: That's not a veiled message your saying, that's pretty forthright this comment. Sheikha Lubna: But it's a message to all of us. If today I lock up my investment opportunity here, money will not come to me, money will go somewhere else. When I have investment coming from abroad, it creates confidence in this country that 'I am a global image'. So when I say it, I am not directing this as a message to a particular country. I am saying all countries are equal when it comes to regulation, when it comes to responsibility, when it comes to strategy in terms of attracting foreign funds and wealth coming to the country. So that's really a lesson that's very very critical. Defterios: A number of firsts: the first to start a B2B marketplace; the first female minister within the country, an economy minister; and the first to launch a perfume range as well. What is it all about? Trailblazing, setting examples, being an entrepreneur? How would you describe what you're doing here? Sheikha Lubna: Everybody laughs about the perfume. One, I think the United Arab Emirates, since inception (it's not from today but from the founder late Sheikh Zayed) has always given equal opportunities for women. But it's up to us as women to decide what is it that we can push, and what it is that we can do and not do. In my personal belief you need a bridge, you need a door opener for women. And sometimes women do not want to take the risk. Sometimes they are shy of achieving what they should be achieving. I had the opportunity and I had the trust from the government and the community, so to me, it is setting the example internally for the young women, and men by the way. Be it in technology, or economy or e-commerce. Defterios: And the perfume line is the exclamation point? Sheikha Lubna: A young woman, actually a perfume creator, who sells exclusively to Saks Fifth Avenue in Dubai, decided to create a perfume with my name. So I had two mandates from her. One, I had to smell it, otherwise if it doesn't smell good I'm not going to take it as a name. So one, I had to actually agree to the scent of the perfume. And it's an Arabic perfume by the way. And second, my mandate was that I would only launch it with my name for her, if she gives 20 percent of its sales and revenue to the Friends of Cancer Patients.

Eliot Spitzer used a high-priced call-girl ring at least eight times in recent months, and agents had him under surveillance twice this year, sources familiar with the investigation said Wednesday. Sources say New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer used a call-girl service eight times in recent months. Spitzer announced his resignation Wednesday, two days after reports of his connection to the Emperors Club VIP became public. He has not been charged with a crime. He told reporters Wednesday, \"I cannot allow my private failings to disrupt the people's work.\" The resignation will take effect Monday.  Watch Spitzer say he will resign \u00bb . The sources said the investigation began when New York's North Fork Bank notified the Treasury Department about suspicious transfers of money from Spitzer's bank accounts. That investigation led agents to the alleged organizers of the prostitution ring, four of whom were charged in a criminal complaint last week, the sources said. A grand jury in New York is likely to hear evidence in the case soon, said Kathleen Mullin, an attorney who said she represents one of the ring's employees. Mullin would not identify her client, but said she was not the woman identified only as \"Kristen\" linked to Spitzer in court papers. She said her client and other women who worked for the Emperors Club have been asked to testify before the grand jury. Asked if her client had any encounters with Spitzer, Mullin said, \"We have no information regarding the governor.\" Wiretaps on suspected members of the ring, authorized in January, yielded more than 5,000 telephone calls and text messages and another 6,000-plus e-mails, according to court papers. In those intercepts, the organizers told clients how to arrange and pay for their trysts, a federal agent's affidavit states. The affidavit identified clients by number, with Spitzer designated \"Client 9,\" a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN this week. Sources familiar with the investigation said federal authorities Wednesday were trying to clamp down on leaks of the investigation's details.  See a timeline of the investigation \u00bb . The affidavit states \"Client 9\" paid $4,300 for 2\u00bd hours with a call girl he arranged to meet at Washington's Mayflower Hotel, with some of that a deposit on a future session. Court papers state he also paid for train tickets, cab fare, mini-bar and room service charges for Kristen -- a 5-foot-5, 105-pound brunette he arranged to meet the night of February 13. Kristen is a 22-year-old would-be singer from New Jersey, The New York Times reported Wednesday. The newspaper said Ashley Youmans -- now known as Ashley Alexandra Dupre -- was identified in court documents as Kristen. Dupre has not been charged with a crime. She made a brief appearance Monday in U.S. Magistrate Court as a witness against four people charged with operating the Emperor's Club, the Times said. In an entry on her MySpace page, Dupre says she left \"a broken family\" and \"abuse\" in 2004, eventually settling in Manhattan \"to pursue my music career.\" \"I am all about my music, and my music is all about me,\" she writes on her MySpace page. \"It flows from what I've been through, what I've seen and how I feel.\" Dupre's mother, Carolyn Capalbo, told the Times she and her daughter were close, adding that \"she obviously got involved in something much larger than her.\" Spitzer, whose squeaky-clean image as a corporate corruption-buster made him a rising Democratic star, testified to the House Financial Services Committee the next day about the effect of the mortgage meltdown. He took a state plane from Buffalo, New York, to Washington and back to New York, his office confirmed Tuesday. Sources told CNN that FBI agents had Spitzer under surveillance at the Mayflower that night -- and on an earlier occasion, on January 26, when no prostitute showed up. His resignation is unlikely to affect decisions about whether he will face prosecution, the sources said. His attorneys were negotiating Wednesday with the U.S. attorney's office in New York in an effort to avoid criminal charges, a source told CNN. But in a statement issued after the governor's resignation, U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia said no agreement had been reached between his office and the governor \"relating to his resignation or any other matter.\" The resignation could be a factor in the U.S. presidential race. Spitzer was a superdelegate, one of nearly 800 party leaders and officials who cast their votes at the Democratic National Convention. They are free to vote for any candidate they wish. Spitzer was a political ally of New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, who is currently in a tight race with Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to win the Democratic nomination. A candidate must get 2,024 delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination. With the race so close, superdelegates could play a larger role in determining the Democratic presidential candidate than in past elections. According to two sources who spoke Tuesday with CNN, Spitzer hit the federal radar when a bank reported to the Internal Revenue Service that a significant amount of money had been suspiciously transferred from one account to another. Late last year, upon investigating the movement of money that the bank initially reported, the IRS found that the accounts were connected to Spitzer, the sources said. The IRS contacted the FBI, which joined the case to investigate the possibility of government corruption. Federal law requires a banking institution to file a suspicious activity report when the institution suspects a transaction is linked to a federal crime. More specifically, banks are required to report to the IRS any transactions totaling $5,000 or more if the transactions \"involve potential money laundering or a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act.\" The act requires businesses to keep documents that are useful for identifying and investigating money laundering. After receiving the IRS report last year, the FBI Corruption Squad linked the account transfers to a prostitution ring, according to sources. The FBI criminal division joined the probe to look into the prostitution ring, while the federal corruption team continued its investigation into Spitzer. Legal experts not involved in the case have said Spitzer could face some type of money-laundering charge, such as structuring a financial transaction to evade federal bank reporting requirements by breaking up a large transaction into smaller ones. Sources tell CNN that prosecutors have considered pursuing a structuring charge, but have run into some difficulty. And Richard Smith, a former Justice Department official, said structuring charges are \"fairly difficult to prove.\" \"You are going to have to prove that he withdrew sums of money with the intent to evade the reporting requirements, to conceal the fact that he is withdrawing the money,\" said Smith, the former deputy chief of the Justice Department's fraud section. \"Because if the money was withdrawn, it appears if his lawyers are correct, in a manner that he didn't conceal anything, it begs the question whether or not they can prove the reckless intent that he withdrew this money in small sums to avoid the reporting requirement.\" Spitzer also could face charges related to the Mann Act, which makes it a federal offense to transport someone across state lines for the purpose of prostitution. But sources tell CNN that the government is less interested in pursuing charges for prostitution than on following the money. E-mail to a friend .

Here, CNN's Arwa Damon describes the hardships faced by Iraqi women. Her documentary airs this weekend on CNN and CNN International. Nahla's husband returned to Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein. He was killed in a bomb blast in 2007. BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The pain here is choking -- it's a dark, suffocating sorrow. \"They took my husband away in front of me. I found his body in the morgue a few days later. He had multiple bullet wounds and his eyes had been gouged out,\" one woman tells me, forcefully twisting a tissue in her hands as if it somehow could ease her agony and erase the chilling memory. She didn't want her story told, too afraid that she would meet the same fate as the man she loved. Her husband's body bore the \"signs of torture.\" How many times has that phrase been used? It's such a common phrase it's as if what really happened gets glossed over: skin scraped off their bodies, fingernails ripped out, horrifying screams of pain before death. How many times have we reported death tolls from one horrific bombing or another and not been able to get across that these are lives that literally were blown apart? No matter how hard we in the media try, Iraq remains a nation filled with untold tragedies, the scope of which so often is overwhelming. And no matter how hard Iraqis try to shield themselves and those they love from the horrors here, more often than not they fail. Yet they keep fighting.  See the sacrifices of Iraq's women \u00bb . Nahla works at a radio station and is one of those women. She's tall, slender, elegantly dressed and has a firm handshake. I look at her and it's nearly impossible to imagine what she's been through. \"This numbers game, you always think that you are exempt from the numbers,\" Nahla tells me, referring to the daily death toll. \"You're pained by them, but you are outside of them.\"  Watch Nahla's struggle to live on \u00bb . On April 14, 2007, her world shattered. There was an explosion on a bridge in the capital and 10 people were killed. Her husband, Mohammed, was one of them. \"And with it, I am motionless,\" she says. \"Truly, life was in color and now it is in black and white. I feel like it is a game of musical chairs we used to play with others. ... One time you are hit with the chair; another time, someone else is. Now, my son and I are out of the game completely, completely.\" The image of the man she loved, tall and proud, is of a doctor who moved his family back to Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein because he believed his country needed him. He was a father who doted on their 6-year-old autistic son. Also etched into her memory is the image of his charred body, melted together with nine others, a twisted pile of black, scorched flesh. Yet Nahla's voice is calm as she speaks, only breaking at the very end of our conversation, when the pain, buried so deep, rises to the surface. She couldn't suppress her gut-wrenching dry sobs. I don't know how many times I have heard stories like hers after nearly five years of war here, and yet I still get chills. I can't stop being in awe -- nor can I stop looking at these women in amazement. Life in Iraq has forced people to confront horror that would leave many of us paralyzed.  Watch a divorcee forced to live amid squalor with her kids \u00bb . Where do they find the strength to keep going? Some don't and choose to live out their lives as hollow shells, just waiting for this wretched existence to be over. But so many others refuse to be beaten down, refuse to allow the horror that is Iraq to win and kill their spirit. \"If I want to see Baghdad again from before the war, I have to do my part while the other person will do his part and the other person will do his part,\" says Dr. Eaman, a children's doctor, as her bright smile seems to shine unnaturally in Baghdad's grim atmosphere. \"This is the dream, and I wish everybody would believe it and it will happen, I'm sure, and this is what is keeping me here,\" she continues. \"I have been attacked by three insurgents and was going to be kidnapped.\" She now lives at the hospital, choosing to disassociate herself from her 8-year-old son to keep him safe.  Watch why \"I must help my people\" \u00bb . \"I wish I can have him with me, live with me, you know, raising him, and just show him how to do things more than anything else,\" Eaman says as she laughs and apologizes for her tears. She knows she chose to live with that pain because she believes other children need her more. \"Iraq is my life, is my country. Being a woman and knowing what other [countries] look like, I want to make a change. I want to make a change for the future for a lot of people.\" Yanar is another fighter, petite with curly dark hair and a commanding presence. \"You have been beaten, pushed, kicked and blindfolded,\" Yanar says, describing today's Iraqi woman. \"You cannot see, you cannot hear, but you are kicking back. It's not OK to be like that. You kick back and you fight for what you deserve ... you should not be turned into a prisoner.\" She started the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq to act as a watchdog to help safeguard women's rights amid war and conflict. She is another woman who exhibits jaw-dropping courage.  Go inside Iraq with CNN's Arwa Damon \u00bb . She left her family and her comfortable life in Canada and came to Baghdad to build growing support for women's rights. She lives a life that at times sounds more like a James Bond movie -- having to constantly move because of death threats -- than that of a mother of a 9-year-old. \"At many stages I had to change my house so my address is a secret; nobody knows where I am other than 10 very close allies,\" Yanar says nonchalantly, as if what she is saying is completely normal. But in Iraq it is -- it's a country where a person's parameters of what they accept as being \"normal\" have to shift to survive. \"What brings me here,\" Yanar says, \"it is that everybody that I love, all the people that I love have been crushed.\" She adds, \"This cannot happen, should not happen, cannot be allowed to happen.\" What we as journalists cannot allow to happen is for these voices to go unheard. No matter how hard it is for us to find them -- literally navigating roadblocks and checkpoints or spending days chasing down someone -- the voices of the innocents caught in war must be heard.

Activists display a portrait of detained democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, in Myanmar. \"It is my duty to give constant and serious considerations to the interests and opinions of as broad a range of political organizations and forces as possible,\" Ibrahim Gambari said, reading the statement from Suu Kyi. On Friday Suu Kyi was able to meet with three executive members of her National League for Democracy and a party spokesman -- the first time they have met in more than three years. Members of her party said Suu Kyi was \"very optimistic\" about prospects of the process for reconciliation, the Associated Press reported. The Nobel Peace Prize winner has said she will continue to be \"guided by the policies and wishes\" of the opposition political party she heads -- the National League for Democracy. In the statement, Suu Kyi also welcomed the appointment of Aung Kyi as the minister of relations, a position the junta created last month to be a liaison between government and Suu Kyi, whom the junta has under house arrest in Yangon. She has been confined to her home for the better part of almost two decades. Aung Kyi -- viewed as a moderate -- was appointed as the liaison officer amid international pressure following September's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations. As many as 110 people are believed to have been killed in the violence, including 40 Buddhist monks. Video smuggled out of the country showed unarmed protesters being beaten by the military regime's security forces, and one man -- believed to be a Japanese journalist -- was shot and killed at close range. The protests were sparked by a huge fuel price increase imposed by the military government, and quickly escalated. Myanmar's military junta said in mid-October that it had detained more than 2,900 people during the crackdown. Many of them are still believed to be in custody. Suu Kyi described her October 25 meeting with the liaison officer as \"constructive,\" said the statement read by Gambari. \"I look forward to further regular discussions.\" Gambari said he will return this week to New York to brief U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the five-day trip to Myanmar, also called Burma. The situation in the secretive Asian nation is not what it was \"a few weeks ago,\" said a U.N. statement released in conjunction with the end of Gambari's trip. \"We now have a process going which would lead to substantive dialogue between the government and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi,\" the statement said. \"The sooner such a dialogue can start, the better for Myanmar.\" During his trip, Gambari met with Myanmar's prime minister, Gen. Thein Sein, and other government officials, as well as Suu Kyi, the United Nations reported.

Francesca Lewis, 13, apparently fell out of the plane or was ejected on impact, her mother, Valerie Lewis, told CNN on Wednesday. The girl endured two days in the rugged mountains of Panama, in frigid temperatures and heavy rain, before rescuers stumbled upon her in the wreckage on Christmas Day. \"She's doing all right,\" Valerie Lewis said. \"She is having tests done at the hospital right now, and so far things seem good -- kind of miraculous. \"The fact that she so far doesn't seem to have any major damage seems incredible.\" Dr. Alexander Quidano at the Mae Lewis Medical Center in Boquete, Panama, said Francesca was in stable condition, awake and speaking. She was being treated for a fractured arm and several cuts, but tests, including a CAT scan, were under way to make sure nothing else was wrong, Quidano said. Francesca apparently was disoriented when her rescuers saw her under a wing of the wrecked plane, her mother said. She thought she was at home and wondered why an airplane wing was in her house, her mother said. Rescuers carried the girl on a stretcher for three and a half hours in torrential rain over rugged terrain to a helicopter. \"We're so relieved to have her with us,\" her mother said. The small plane disappeared Sunday in a mountainous area of Panama. Authorities found the bodies of pilot Edwin Lasso, American businessman Michael Klein and Klein's 13-year-old daughter, Talia, about 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, according to a statement posted on the Web site of Panama's civil protection agency.

Authorities and hundreds of volunteers spent the last two days searching the dense jungles and mountainous terrain, but heavy rain in the area had hampered recovery efforts. \"I just want to thank all of the people that cared so much about trying to help us,\" Valerie Lewis said. \"So many people tried to help, and at great effort and sacrifice, and through the Christmas holiday. \"I mean, the most important family holiday, people were giving up that to go and trudge through the mud.

Election officials say Nawaz Sharif's previous convictions bar him from standing for reelection. A spokesman for Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League told CNN Monday that Sharif had been barred by the election commission because of a previous criminal conviction. Sharif filed paperwork for his candidacy last week, although he had left open the possibility that he would boycott the election in protest of a state of emergency imposed by President Pervez Musharraf. Sharif, an outspoken critic of Musharraf, who ousted him from power in 1999, had said he wanted to keep all options open. Sharif returned to Pakistan last month, ending seven years in exile in Saudi Arabia. He had first returned in September, but Pakistani authorities deported him within hours of his arrival. Sharif was convicted of terrorism, hijacking and tax evasion after Musharraf seized power in 1999. He was released in 2000 in exchange for agreeing to 10 years of exile in Saudi Arabia. He retained his Pakistani citizenship, but has not been allowed to travel to Pakistan or directly take part in Pakistani politics. Musharraf, who quit as military leader and took office for a third term last week, has pledged to lift the state of emergency by December 16. He was criticized of using the emergency to crack down on political rivals and to purge the judiciary of those likely to block the approval of his reappointment as leader.

French soldiers at the NATO-led peacekeeping mission in Kosovo last month. Kosovo is expected to declare independence from Serbia early in the new year. Serbia, however, insists the region should remain autonomous within its borders. Speaking at the end of a one-day summit of European heads in Brussels, Jose Socrates, the Portuguese prime minister currently holding the European Union presidency, said that sending the security mission was a \"political decision.\" The police and security force is expected to be deployed to the Balkan state ahead of an announcement of independence. \"This is the clearest signal that the EU could possibly give that it intends to lead on the whole issue of Kosovo's future, its status and its role in the region,\" Socrates said. According to CNN's Robin Oakley in Brussels, European leaders are trying to balance an obvious readiness to back Kosovan independence with incentives to Serbia, which is seeking membership of the EU. EU leaders are deeply conscious of their failure in the early 1990s to move early enough to prevent the bloodletting in the Balkans over the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, he said. Although most EU leaders support Serbia becoming a member state to boost stability in the Balkans, French President Nicholas Sarkozy said that Serbia's membership is dependent on it recognizing Kosovo's independence and handing over war criminals. Socrates confirmed to CNN that any fast-tracking of Serbia into the EU could only be considered if it agreed to hand over Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb general wanted at the The Hague for suspected war crimes. Two years of negotiations on the future status of Kosovo ended in failure earlier this week, when talks mediated by Europe, the United States and Russia ended without an agreement. The disputed province is dear to the Serbs, Orthodox Christians who regard it as Serbian  territory. But it is equally coveted by Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, Muslims who have a 90 percent majority. Since 1999 the United Nations has been running the province with NATO peacekeepers, who still number 16,000.

Tocopilla, Chile, north of Santiago, is about 35 km (21 miles) from the quake's epicenter. \"Tonight, people are going to have to sleep in the street, because there are a great number of houses that are uninhabitable,\" said Moyano. Places that could be used as shelters, such as schools and gyms, were  damaged in the quake, the mayor said. Moyano put the number of people without shelter at 4,000. Tocopilla's population is 24,000. Moyano described going through the damaged city and running into people asking, \"Mayor, my house collapsed. What do I do? Mayor, I don't have water.

Investigators search for the body of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach Friday. Tests found the \"trace of violent activity in the house\" and \"evidence of an attempted cleanup,\" said Onslow County Sheriff Ed Brown. Investigators are treating the death of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach as a murder, Brown added. Lauterbach, 20 -- who was eight months pregnant -- was reported missing from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, by her mother December 19. Cpl. Cesar Armando Laurean, whom Lauterbach had accused of rape, is the suspected killer, and is being sought, Brown said. He confirmed that Laurean had left a note, but did not divulge what it said. Investigators told CNN, however, that Laurean left a note to his wife saying Lauterbach had committed suicide and that he buried the body. \"Evidence now is saying what he's claiming happened did not happen like he said it happened,\" Brown said. Authorities searching Laurean's home found a cavity in his backyard earlier Friday. A preliminary investigation indicated a \"suspicious situation,\" prompting police to secure the scene and wait for daylight Saturday.  Watch authorities search for a grave \u00bb . \"We think that we have found what would be the skeletal remains [of Lauterbach],\" Onslow County District Attorney Dewey Hudson told reporters. While authorities will not know for sure until Saturday, \"there are certainly some strong indicators that there are human remains\" buried in the cavity, he said. \"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand if there's a cavity out back and blood on the inside, that's probably going to be a key location for where this crime may have taken place,\" Brown said. He also hinted that investigators have uncovered more twists in the case. \"I do think this case is going to be a bizarre ending, and when I say bizarre, more than just a death and a burial.\" Brown stunned reporters earlier in the day by opening a press conference with the announcement: \"She is dead, and she is buried.\"  Watch Brown describe the cavity \u00bb .

The outpouring of love from family, friends, neighbors and the general community has been very touching. \"Please understand that the family needs time alone to deal with this tragedy. We wish to thank everyone for their love and concern.\" \"They're having a very difficult time dealing with this,\" said Peter Steiner, a Kentucky psychiatrist who is Maria Lauterbach's uncle and Mary Lauterbach's brother. \"They remained hopeful, and really, although everyone knew it was a possibility, it was very difficult when it became apparent.\" Brown said a witness came forward Friday morning with a statement and evidence that convinced authorities Lauterbach was dead. Brown wouldn't name the witness, or describe Lauterbach's cause of death, except to say she died \"from an injury.\" Asked whether the witness was in protective custody, Brown said the person does not feel the need for protective custody, as Laurean likely left the county and possibly the state. A source close to the investigation told CNN the witness is Laurean's wife. Lauterbach's relatives believe the pregnancy was the result of the alleged rape, Steiner said. A reporter who asked military officials why Laurean hadn't been taken into custody after Lauterbach reported the alleged rape was told there were indications that Lauterbach and Laurean carried on \"some sort of friendly relationship\" after she filed the complaint against him. \"The information developed over the last 24 hours leads us to believe that she still had some kind of contact\" with him, said Paul Ciccarelli, agent in charge of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service at Camp Lejeune. Because of that, Laurean wasn't considered a flight risk, he said. Steiner disputed that, saying his niece had no relationship with Laurean. Ciccarelli also said the rape investigation is still active.  Watch police face unanswered questions \u00bb . Lauterbach disappeared before she was able to testify at an Article 32 hearing -- a kind of military grand jury -- about the sexual assault. Earlier Friday, Brown said a Marine who returned to North Carolina from California -- Sgt. Daniel Durham, 20, in whose home Lauterbach had been living for a short time -- was questioned, but does not appear to have any link to the death. Lauterbach had rented a room in Durham's home, off the base, because she had been subjected to repeated harassment by the Marines after reporting the alleged rape, Steiner said.

Passengers pass through security at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois. GAO officials are expected to testify about the investigation Thursday before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The investigators reported that most of the time security officers followed Transportation Security Administration policies and procedures, but investigators were able to take advantage of \"weaknesses in TSA procedures and other vulnerabilities.\" \"These weaknesses were identified based on a review of public information,\" the planned GAO testimony says. Investigators concluded that if they had attempted the same test at other airports, they would have evaded detection. But the GAO did not detail the weaknesses because they \"are sensitive security information.\" The investigators obtained the bomb-making components at local stores and over the Internet for less than $150, according to testimony.  Watch a tester point out a TSA mistake \u00bb . The GAO said its investigators also tested the devices that could be built with the components they smuggled and discovered that \"a terrorist using these devices could cause severe damage to an airplane and threaten the safety of passengers.\" The GAO investigators devised two types of devices: an \"improvised explosive device\" made of a liquid explosive and a low-yield detonator, and an \"improvised incendiary device\" that could be created by combining commonly available products prohibited in carry-on luggage. The GAO said it found the instructions for creating the devices \"using publicly available information,\" including Internet searches. According to the testimony, a transportation security officer barred one of the investigators from bringing an unlabeled bottle of medicated shampoo through the checkpoint. But the security officer allowed a liquid component of the improvised explosive device to pass through undetected, although that item is prohibited by the TSA. In another test, the investigator put coins in his pockets to assure he would get a secondary inspection. But the officer, using a hand-wand and a pat-down, failed to detect any of the prohibited items the investigator was carrying. The GAO said it had briefed the TSA on its findings \"to help them take corrective action.\" In testimony to be provided to the same congressional committee, TSA chief Kip Hawley defends the administration's policies and procedures, saying that the screening checkpoints are but one of a \"multilayered approach to security.\" \"We recognize that, despite our efforts to make each layer as strong as possible, a concerted effort may target any one layer,\" according to the testimony. \"Our ongoing success is a result of the tremendous power in the reinforced, multiple layers. Truly, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts -- and together, they are formidable.\" Hawley sketches for members of Congress 19 security steps the TSA employs before, during and after checkpoint screening. \"Each and every one of these 19 security layers is important and strong in its own right,\" he says. \"Linked together, they are effective and daunting.\" Although it would not discuss the specific nature of its recommendations, the GAO said it recommended establishing special screening lines based on risk and passengers with special needs. The TSA should introduce more \"aggressive, visible and unpredictable\" measures to detect concealed items and develop new technology for screening at checkpoints. Hawley's said the TSA concurs with the GAO's recommendations and specifically discussed several \"new technology\" items that he said were \"greatly improving our effectiveness in detecting prohibited items.\" Among the new technology, he said, were whole body imagers, bottled liquids scanners, hand-held explosives scanners and advanced technology X-rays. And, he added, \"our pursuit of new technology is not limited to what I described today.\" He also said the TSA is constantly conducting covert tests of the screening process, including detection of prohibited liquids and IEDs. \"The nation's aviation system remains secure,\" he said, \"but requires ongoing improvement and vigilance to stay ahead of the threat of terrorism.\"  E-mail to a friend .", "67fc9fa49a2c443dcbab030b9c6247a662716bc9": "(CNN) -- The orgy of violence that has greeted Kenya's disputed election result has led to hundreds of deaths and forced tens of thousands to flee their homes. But away from the tragic human cost, the unrest has also provoked concerns about the stability of the east African country's economy, until now seen as a model for the region. Businesses have been destroyed and looted and supply routes disrupted after the opposition accused incumbent president Mwai Kibaki of election fraud after he was declared winner Sunday. Investors are watching events closely in the country, fearful of how it could affect one of Africa's few economic success stories. And the early signs have been worrying. The equity market on the Nairobi Stock Exchange lost 40 billion Kenyan Shillings ($591 million) in value on its first day of New Year trading Wednesday, the Kenyan financial newspaper Business Daily Africa reported. And business leaders said that the government was losing around 2 billion Shillings ($29.5 million) a day in lost revenue as a result of the political violence, the paper reported. \"We do seem to be in a new place, there's a lot of uncertainty about where we go from here. And a lot depends crucially on how long-lasting this is,\" said Razia Kahn, an analyst specializing in Africa at Standard Chartered bank. Kenya has attracted a large number of multi-nationals and is home to one of the world's fastest growing stock exchanges. Its relative economic success has been helped in part by its thriving tourist sector, with visitors attracted by its abundant wildlife and pristine beaches. Provisional figures for 2006 from the Kenya's tourist board said the country had received 1.5 million visitors for the year, a growth of 5.2 per cent. However, fears that the tourist industry could take a heavy hit from the unrest grew with the British Federation of Tour Operators announcing Thursday it was suspending all holidays to the country departing up to and including this Saturday.  Watch an aid worker describe fears that crisis may resemble Rwanda's \u00bb . British tourists already in the country have been advised by the British Foreign Office to stay indoors and to stay away from the major cities. There are also worries about the knock-on effect for the region, since around 40 percent of Kenya's exports go to other African nations, Kahn said. Of even greater concern is the effect on Kenya's lucrative agriculture industry. Exports of tea, coffee, vegetables and flowers are big earners for the country, with agriculture making up about a fifth of the total economy. There have been media reports of tea and coffee auctions being halted by the violence as well as widespread disruption to transport routes as rioters blockade major roads across the country.

Iraqi women mourn the death of their relative outside the morgue in the restive city of Baquba, Iraq, on March 12. \"Despite claims that the security situation has improved in recent months, the human rights situation is disastrous,\" Amnesty International says in its report, titled \"Carnage and Despair: Iraq Five Years On.\" In a summary of the report, Amnesty writes that \"a climate of impunity has prevailed, the economy is in tatters and the refugee crisis\" keeps escalating. The International Committee of the Red Cross, in a report titled \"Iraq: No Let-up in the Humanitarian Crisis,\" writes, \"Despite limited improvements in security in some areas, armed violence is still having a disastrous impact. Civilians continue to be killed in the hostilities. \"The injured often do not receive adequate medical care. Millions of people have been forced to rely on insufficient supplies of poor-quality water as water and sewage systems suffer from a lack of maintenance and a shortage of engineers.\" The Bush administration and many Republican lawmakers, including presidential candidate Sen. John McCain, have frequently praised successes in Iraq in recent months, noting improvements in security in key areas. They attribute that in part to the buildup of U.S. troops in Iraq ordered by President Bush last year. Vice President Dick Cheney described the five year U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in a news conference Monday during a visit to Baghdad. \"This week marks the fifth anniversary,\" said Cheney. \"It has been a difficult, challenging, but none the less successful endeavor.\" Democrats, including presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, have said the government failed to use the downturn in violence to achieve the steps it was supposed to make possible. Sen. John McCain met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Monday where he stressed the United States' commitment to Iraq.  \"We recognize that al Qaeda is on the run, but they are not defeated. Al Qaeda continues to pose a great threat to the security and very existence of Iraq as a democracy. So we know there's still a lot more work that needs to be done,\" he said. Amnesty writes, \"Key political benchmarks have yet to be realized.\" Both Amnesty and the Red Cross slam the Iraqi government for failing to grapple with the critical needs of their populations. Amnesty also says the Iraqi government and the U.S.-led Multi-National Forces  are responsible for some nightmarish circumstances. \"Civilians are also at risk from Multi-National Forces and Iraqi security forces, with many killed by excessive force and tens of thousands detained without charge or trial,\" Amnesty writes in its summary. \"The death penalty was reintroduced in 2004 and hundreds of people have been sentenced to death. At least 33 people were executed in 2007, many after unfair trials.\" In its report, Amnesty says the Iraqi government \"has failed to introduce practical measures to deal with the gross and serious human rights violations perpetrated by its security forces. There appears to be no serious willingness to investigate properly the many incidents of abuses, including killings of civilians, torture and rape, and to bring those responsible to justice. \"The government has also been unable to reign in Shiite militia groups, such as the Mehdi Army, or to rid the Interior Ministry of death squads. The fact that the government is divided along sectarian lines has serious repercussions on its effectiveness and bodes ill for the future.\" The two reports cite a litany of concerns, including severe widespread poverty, a lack of food and water, and broken families left to scrounge for whatever they can find to get by. Both reports describe a situation that shows no sign of clear improvement. Amnesty also says conditions for women have worsened with the rise of fundamentalist religious groups. Many women \"have been forced to wear Islamic dress or targeted for abduction, rape or killing.\" The group notes a study by the World Health Organization in 2006/2007 that found 21 percent of Iraqi women had experienced physical violence. Amnesty adds that the \"predominantly Kurdish region of northern Iraq has been more stable with fewer acts of violence, and has seen growing economic prosperity and foreign investment.

His Tuscan Sun Festival opens Saturday in Cortona, Italy. An all-new Singapore Sun Festival opens October 18. And a secret known to missionaries everywhere is clearly in sway at the Festival del Sole in Napa Valley, which has just concluded its second year: Bonding with the locals. With quick fervor, local leaders, the hospitality industry and those all-important vintners of Napa have embraced their festival. When symphony conductor St\u00e9phane Den\u00e8ve mentioned last year that he'd like to get married there, Tatiana and Gerret Copeland of the Bouchaine wine estate threw the ceremony for them in the vineyards.   See images from a maestro's marriage in the vineyards of Napa during this year's Festival del Sole \u00bb . \"It's a mission in my life to have more and more people enjoy and love the arts,\" Wissman says in an interview sandwiched between Den\u00e8ve's presentation of the Grieg piano concerto and Prokofiev's \"Romeo and Juliet\" suite with the Russian National Orchestra.  Watch highlights and comments from Barrett Wissman and the artists of Festival del Sole \u00bb . \"One of the reasons that we have these festivals -- engage local communities and have music, literature, art, film, cuisine, wine, all these subjects -- is we attract different people who like each one. And then get them to like something else. Today, our goal in education in the arts is to get everybody involved.\" Wissman is uniquely positioned to \"get everybody involved.\" More than a priest or even a bishop in this arts-mission field, he's a cardinal in the industry, the chairman of IMG Artists, a major player in world artists' representation. IMG's roster includes violinists Joshua Bell and Itzhak Perlman, mezzo-soprano Fredericka von Stade, flutist James Galway, guitarist Christopher Parkening, the Joffrey Ballet and composer Jay Greenberg, among many others. Wissman has just announced a new managing director for IMG in North and South America, Elizabeth Sobol. She is, herself, a co-producer of a new festival in Boca Raton, Florida, and architect of a highly publicized new joint venture for IMG with Gorfaine-Schwartz, the agency representing trumpeter-composer Chris Botti, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, singer-songwriter James Taylor and Hollywood film composer John Williams. No matter how far-flung the festivals and events, Wissman stays near his roots. \"I'm a pianist,\" he says, \"a concert pianist. I still play, I play from time to time in the festivals. So I'm a musician, I come from the arts.\" In the case of Napa's Festival del Sole, Wissman has a co-founder, San Francisco-based attorney Richard Walker, who has a specialization in artists' management.  Watch an audio slide show in which Richard Walker talks about the atmosphere of the festival \u00bb . Having worked with Mikhail Pletnev's Russian National Orchestra, Walker says, since its inception in 1990 as the first symphonic entity founded after the Soviet Union's collapse, he emphasizes the stylistic range demanded in festival work. And Walker echoes Wissman's interest in making these festivals oases in the itinerant lives of world-traveling artists. \"The events that surround the musical performances,\" Walker says, \"are attended by the artists, themselves -- a time of camaraderie for them because they see each other and spend time enjoying each other's company.\" As if on cue, two world-class pianists, Polish-Hungarian Piotr Anderszewski and French-born Jean-Yves Thibaudet, are seated at the same table at a gala post-concert dinner held by Far Niente wine estate on a cloudless night in a circular arbor crowded with honeysuckle. Thibaudet jumps up at one point to accompany violinist Bell in Manuel Ponce's \"Estrellita,\" watched by composer Marco Tutino and cellist Nina Kotova. Read about Joshua Bell's recent win of the $75,000 Fisher Prize . \"We are located in a wonderful hotel,\" says conductor Den\u00e8ve, the newlywed whose base of operations is Glasgow where he is music director of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. \"Wonderful swimming pool, actually it's a great way to socialize and get to know more and more the fellow artists because usually you are engaged and just have one or two nights.\" Thibaudet places a similar premium on these festivals' sense of community for artists. \"When we have concerts,\" he says, \"we just come into town, we play and we leave.  Usually there won't be any other soloists, there's only you. So we never get to meet each other during the year.\" And it appears that the Napa community couldn't be happier than to find these major concert and recording artists \"working the valley.\" In a kind of vine-roots, if not grassroots, effort, the wineries have jumped with endearing eagerness into what Walker terms a \"friendly competition\" for whose after-concert gala can be the most opulent. They lay on rich dinners set at starlit tables, some by glowing pools, others on cricket-chirpy hilltops and still others under chandeliers hung high in some of the most honored wine-making facilities in the country. One of the venues for the festival this year has been the Medieval-looking Castello di Amorosa, another the renovated Lincoln Theatre in Yountville. Wineries participating in special events around an intensely proud sponsorship of the festival have included Far Niente, the Copelands' Bouchaine Vineyards, Darioush Winery, Clos Pegase, Robert Mondavi Winery, Peju Province Winery, Pine Ridge Winery  and St. Sup\u00e9ry Vineyards and Winery. Many of these are festival-funding partners, joined by Domaine Chandon, Blackbird Vineyards, Dalla Valle Vineyards, Plumpjack Winery, Folio Winemakers' Studio, Gargiulo Vineyards, Swanson Vineyards and COPIA, a nonprofit center of wine-making culture in the valley. The vintners, themselves, seem to enjoy the chance to mingle in the common interest of the festival and in the company of these artists they seem to be tying onto their hearts like vine tendrils in their fields. Margrit Mondavi is a welcome guest one evening at Far Niente, as are Tatiana and Gerret Copeland of the Bouchaine house. Florence's Maria Manetti Farrow, whose ranging Villa Mille Rose is an influential olive oil estate, seems to be everyone's fondest table mate and every artist's favorite dinner companion. Resort partners include Auberge du Soleil, Calistoga Ranch, Solage Calistoga, the Carneros Inn and Silverado Resort. Walker, in fact, estimates that the Napa festival -- which with Cortona and Singapore is produced by the nonprofit Del Sole Foundation for the Arts and Humanities -- could cost as much as $10 million to stage, if the many in-kind services provided by hoteliers, wineries and others were totaled in cash. The \"rehearsals\" for all this, if you will, took place in Cortona, where Wissman and Charles Letourneau, executive producer, have staged several years of festival events in what Wissman likes to call \"a magical, Fellini-esque feel.\" When he looked for a spot in the United States to base a sister festival, \"Napa was the perfect place,\" close to the metropolitan pace of San Francisco but removed enough to shelter artists and audiences in peace. Wissman looks across a long, candlelit table amid shadowy great barrels of Bouchaine wine. French conductor Den\u00e8ve has Tatiana Copeland's dinner guests in stitches with his tale of how he proposed to his new wife on the glass floor high atop the Canada's National Tower in Toronto -- \"My God, it was frightening!\" \"One has to lead,\" says Wissman, Cortona's Saturday opening already occupying his thoughts.  \"When doing something important.

Hillary Clinton rebounded from her third-place finish in last week's Iowa caucuses. Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent the past few days saying she has the experience to change Washington. She narrowly defeated Sen. Barack Obama in the New Hampshire primary, with 39 percent of the vote to Obama's 37. \"Last week, I listened to you, and in the process I found my own voice,\" the New York senator said after her victory. \"Now let's give America the kind of comeback that New Hampshire has just given me.\" Forty-three percent of self-styled independents said they voted for Obama, and 31 percent said they backed Clinton. Independents made up 43 percent of all voters polled. Addressing his roaring supporters after the race was called, Obama congratulated Clinton. But he was a candidate determined to draw a distinction between Clinton and himself. \"But the reason our campaign has always been different, the reason we began this improbable journey almost a year ago, is because it's not just about what I will do as president,\" he said. \"It is also about what you, the people who love this country, the citizens of the United States of America, can do to change it. That's what this election is all about.\" But Clinton was ahead of Obama 45 percent to 34 percent among those who said they were registered Democrats. Those voters made up a majority -- 54 percent -- of all respondents. Clinton also claimed the majority of women's votes, according to the polling. That's in contrast to last week's Iowa caucuses, in which Obama surprised observers by stealing the female vote from Clinton. Analysts say that shift among female voters was crucial to the Clinton turnaround. \"If I had a single word, the word would be 'women,' \" said CNN political analyst Bill Schneider. \"She got the women back.\" And Schneider said the support of union voters that put Clinton over the top. \"Union voters have her a 10 point lead,\" he said. CNN projected former Sen. John Edwards to finish third. College graduates, who made up 29 percent of the electorate, opted narrowly for Clinton -- 38 percent to Obama's 37 percent, according to the polling. Those polled who called themselves very liberal, and moderate, went with Clinton over Obama -- although by less than 2 percentage points in each -- and those who said they are somewhat liberal were evenly split. Pundits also were citing the role of former President Bill Clinton in helping his wife recover from what pre-primary polls were suggesting was a deficit of 9 percentage points to Obama in New Hampshire. The former president spent Tuesday in Hanover -- home to Dartmouth College -- where Obama had been expected to win handily. \"They dispatched him to the area that Obama was surging,\" said CNN analyst Donna Brazille, who managed former Vice President Al Gore's campaign in 2000. \"I think it had the effect of tamping down Obama support and giving Senator Clinton a real reason to come back in this race.\" New Hampshire was considered crucial to Clinton's campaign. If Obama had been able to sweep Iowa and New Hampshire -- after months of Clinton being considered the front-runner among Democrats -- it could have given him powerful momentum going into future primaries. \"Age is also playing a big factor -- older voters are overwhelmingly outnumbering younger voters -- a proportion that is clearly benefiting Clinton,\" Schneider said. \"Sixty-seven percent of Democratic primary voters are over the age of 40, and they are breaking heavily for Clinton over Obama.\" Over the past several days, Clinton has trumpeted her experience, saying that she has delivered change as both first lady and as a senator. After losing to Obama in last week's Iowa caucuses, it was unclear whether she could overcome what appeared to be Obama's ability to electrify American voters who had previously taken a sour and skeptical view of politicians and the political process. The duel between the Obama and Clinton campaigns grew especially testy Monday and Tuesday. She said she had more experience than he, and was therefore more qualified. He accused her of representing the status quo of Washington. And on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, Bill Clinton criticized the media for not pressing Obama more fully on Iraq, and accused the Illinois senator of shifting his position to reflect changing attitudes about the war in Iraq. Then, there was an issue unto itself -- Hillary Clinton's almost-tears. Clinton's eyes welled up this week while responding to a voter's question about her health and appearance. Pundits and voters alike questioned whether Clinton's emotions were sincere or faked as part of some strategy to diminish criticism that she is too steely, too cold. In front of the crowd of mostly female New Hampshire voters, an admittedly fatigued Clinton responded to a question by saying: \"This is very personal for me, it's not just political, it's [that] I see what's happening, we have to reverse it.\" Her voice broke, and she was then applauded by the crowd. Polls indicated the show of emotions fared well with male voters, according to CNN's John King, but turned off some female voters. Edwards was followed in votes by New Mexico Gov.

Protests at the crackdown have taken place overseas, including one outside the Myanmar embassy, London. \"He calls on the senior leadership of the country to cooperate fully with this mission in order to take advantage of the willingness of the United Nations to assist in the process of a national reconciliation through dialogue,\" said a U.N. statement. The envoy, Ibrahim Gambari, is scheduled to lead a briefing on the situation in Myanmar for the U.N. Security Council Wednesday afternoon. \"Noting reports of the use of force and of arrests and beatings, the secretary-general calls again on authorities to exercise utmost restraint toward the peaceful demonstrations taking place, as such action can only undermine the prospects for peace, prosperity and stability in Myanmar,\" Ban's statement said. There's been no official word yet if the military junta ruling Myanmar will accept the offer from the U.N. secretary-general. Speaking at the Labour Party conference Wednesday, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown underscored that any trampling on human rights would not be accepted. \"The whole world is now watching Burma and this illegal and oppressive regime should know that the whole world will hold it to account,\" he said. U.S. President George W. Bush, speaking to the U.N. General Assembly's annual session Tuesday before the crackdown, said his administration would impose stiffer sanctions against the country's military regime. \"The United States will tighten economic sanctions on the leaders of the regime and their financial backers. We will impose an expanded visa ban on those responsible for the most egregious violations of human rights, as well as their family members,\" he said. \"We will continue to support the efforts of humanitarian groups working to alleviate suffering in Burma (the country's traditional name) and urge the United Nations and all nations to use their diplomatic and economic leverage to help the Burmese people reclaim their freedom.\" His comments were echoed by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, also at the U.N. General Assembly. \"I'm deeply concerned about the situation in Burma and Myanmar, and I would like to appeal for the peaceful, spontaneous demonstrations which are expressing just political and social concerns that they not be repressed by force in any way,\" Sarkozy said. Soe Aung, National Council of the Union of Burma spokesman, called for the world to take action. \"There should be some action -- decisive action -- taken by the international community. At least there should be an urgent meeting of the Security Council level,\" he said. Aung also commented that the demonstrators do not seem content to back down. \"The monks are very determined that they are going to go ahead with the demonstrations unless their demands are met,\" he said. Such demands include an apology from ministry authorities for the mistreatment of monks in central Myanmar, a reduction in the price of gasoline -- which originally sparked protests in late August -- and the release of protesters detained since demonstrations began, Aung said.

A woman rides on a bus exclusively for female passengers last month in Mexico City. Fans of the new service call their daily commutes more pleasant now that bus rides steer clear of too-close-for-comfort contact with men. \"We're not just talking about sexual harassment, about rapes or about incidents of violence,\" said Ariadna Montiel, director of the Network of Passengers' Transportation for the Government of the Federal District. \"But also about touching, staring, which is what generally occurs on public transport.\" The single-sex service, which started in January, is available on four major lines in the city, and it's expected to expand to another 15. Other plans include replacing male drivers with women. One woman described the service as \"excellent,\" saying it's \"more comfortable too because it doesn't make as many stops.\" Another passenger said she feels more comfortable and safer. Last year, the government received seven complaints of sexual abuse aboard the city's buses, which provide 200 million rides each year, officials said.  Authorities said that a single complaint is enough to justify taking such measures.

Kuwait's emir has dissolved parliament following conflict between the Cabinet and govenrment. The emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, said he was forced to dissolve parliament to safeguard Kuwait's national unity, citing the fragile political situation in the region and his primary concern for internal security and stability. New elections have been set for May 17, according to Kuwait's state-run news agency, KUNA. According to Kuwait's constitution, elections must be held within 60 days of dissolving parliament. Kuwait's parliament, made up mostly of opposition politicians, has been locked in a feud with the government which it accuses of corruption and abuse of power. Parliament has continuously called for some government members to be investigated, which is what prompted the Cabinet to resign this week. Al-Sabah said he tried to get lawmakers and government ministers to reconcile their differences, but they only inflamed the situation through their statements to the media. E-mail to a friend .

She prepares their meals, gets them ready for school and helps them with their homework. Keri Christensen was nearly a victim of a roadside bombing in Iraq when the convoy in front of hers was hit. But this housewife and mother of two is far different than most of the women living in her Denver, Colorado, suburb. She's an Iraqi war veteran, among the first women in the United States to be classified as combat veterans. Even though she's been home from the war for more than 2\u00bd years, she's now fighting another battle -- this one with depression, nightmares, sleeplessness and anger. She says all of it is caused by her time in Iraq. \"I start feeling those feelings of 'I'm not worthy. I can't raise my family,' \" Christensen said. Women have made up about 11 percent of the military force in Iraq and Afghanistan in the past six years, according to the Department of Defense; that's an estimated 180,000 women in the war zone. The figure dwarfs the 41,000 women deployed during the Persian Gulf War and the 7,500 who served during the Vietnam War, mostly as nurses. Unlike past wars, women are assigned to combat support roles. Many are seeing violence firsthand in an unconventional war.  Watch CNN's Randi Kaye report on female veterans \u00bb . As a member of the National Guard, Christensen transported tanks in Iraq. She says she was shot at and was nearly a victim of a roadside bomb when a convoy in front of hers was hit. \"You have this fear, 'Oh, my God, I still have to go through there,' \" she recalled. \" 'Am I going to make it?' \" Christensen says that she was sexually harassed by a superior while serving in Iraq and that the harassment added to the pressure created by just being in a war zone. \"I just know it took a big toll on me because I was trying to deal with it myself. Just trying to be a soldier,\" Christensen said. In 2007, the Department of Veterans Affairs found that women are reporting signs of mental health issues when they return home at a higher rate than their male counterparts. The VA diagnosed 60,000 veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. Of those, 22 percent of women suffered from \"military sexual trauma,\" which includes sexual harassment or assault, compared with 1 percent of men. Christensen, who has been diagnosed with PTSD, says she doesn't like leaving her comfort zone. She doesn't drive more than two miles from her home. \"When I get outside my familiar safe territory, I start to feel overwhelmed,\" Christensen said. \"It gets foggy. Not sure where I'm really going. Something comes over me where I don't feel like I have control over it.\" \"PTSD is actually something that shows up over time, and so the natural recovery process doesn't happen,\" said Dr. Darrah Westrup, who counsels female veterans at the VA-run Women's Health Clinic in Menlo Park, California. \"So three months out or so, you find yourself still not sleeping, still with nightmares, still having intrusive thoughts,\" Westrup said. Westrup says another factor contributing to poor mental health is the high amount of sexual trauma reported by women screened by the Veterans Administration. She says many women have trouble reporting the trauma to their superiors out of fear of retribution. \"When you are in a war zone, your survival depends on people watching your back and on unit cohesion,\" Westrup said. \"The same individuals who attacked you are those who will be protecting you, or you'll be fighting alongside the next day.\" Christensen receives counseling and group therapy sponsored by the VA. However, the military has said there is no merit to her claims that she suffered military sexual trauma. Like many who suffer from post-traumatic stress, Christensen still has her ups and downs. She says she's just working to get past the feelings of guilt, shame, loss of control and low self-esteem. \"I don't think we'll ever be the same. I think that you can learn to cope with it, and that's what I'm learning right now,\" she said.

Arlene Samen, right, helps provide childbirth education and equipment to those in need through One H.E.A.R.T. \"When I came to Tibet I heard of so many tragic stories of women dying -- no access to care in remote areas, no history of trained birth attendants, and no knowledge about pregnancy and childbirth,\" Samen recalls. It is a problem that stretches well beyond Tibet's borders. According to the World Health Organization, more than 500,000 women worldwide die each year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth, and nearly 7 million babies are either born dead or die within 28 days of their life. Almost all these deaths occur in the developing world. Upon her return from Tibet, and in association with the University of Utah Health Services Center, Samen, 54, created One H.E.A.R.T. (Health Education And Research in Tibet) to combat the high infant and maternal mortality rates in Tibet and around the world. Through One H.E.A.R.T., Samen's mission is to reach remote areas where women have limited access to a safe delivery, distribute the organization's training model, and debunk any fears toward safe, sanitary birthing practices. \"It's not uncommon for babies to die from basic things like not cleaning their mouth out to breathe,\" says Samen. \"In surveys we've done, more than 50 percent of babies that died were born alive. This is due to lack of education.\"  Watch Samen talk about the organization's work \u00bb . Since 1998, One H.E.A.R.T has worked to set up centers that teach and educate local nurse practitioners, villagers and expectant mothers on how to deliver and care for newborn babies. A huge part of the organization's instruction includes hands-on birthing demonstration and distribution of community-tailored birth kits. \"I witnessed deliveries where the infant did not even have a blanket,\" says Samen. \"I put a kit together with very simple items and anyone, anywhere can use this kit to keep infants and mothers alive during and after childbirth.\"  Watch home video of Samen in Tibet, where she delivered a baby \u00bb . The birth kit typically includes a sterilized razor blade, a clean sheet, three towels for the baby, three fleece blankets, a string to tie around the umbilical cord, gloves for the person delivering the baby and soap for hand washing. Over the last 10 years, Samen's team has supplied more than 3,400 safe birthing kits to pregnant women and has trained more than 1,000 people in life-saving techniques. For 2008, One H.E.A.R.T.'s education outreach program has targeted Nayarit, Mexico, a mountainous terrain in Mesoamerica and the native land of more than 50,000 indigenous Cora and Huichol Indians. This past February, accompanied by a team of doctors and translators, Samen spent three days embedded within Nayarit's Santa Theresa communities, using an instructional newborn doll for childbirth training sessions and discussing safe birthing techniques and procedures. \"The traditional birth attendants told us they don't like to bring the women to the hospital because there's a fear of C-section and complications. [The women] would rather die than to come in and get help,\" Samen says.  Watch Samen describe the rigors of bringing a child birthing center to a remote area of Mexico \u00bb . \"I found that really astounding and would like to look into that further to see if there's ways that we can cross that barrier and really help them so that they don't have that kind of fear.\" Samen lives in Salt Lake City, but currently spends several months of the year in Tibet. Future plans for One H.E.A.R.T. include training local partners on the ground in Nepal and Ecuador.

The cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed provoked widespread outrage in the Muslim world two years ago. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service said police arrested a 40-year-old Dane of Moroccan origin and two Tunisians. The Danish citizen is charged with a terrorism offense, the intelligence service said, and the Tunisians will be deported. Police have not yet released the names of the three. The operation took place in the Aarhus area of western Denmark at 4:30 a.m. local time following lengthy surveillance, the intelligence service said. The target of the plot, the intelligence service said, was the cartoonist for the Danish newspaper Morgenavisen Jullands-Posten, which first published the controversial drawings in September 2005. The paper identified the cartoonist as Kurt Westergaard.  Watch how threats have targeted cartoonists \u00bb . \"Not wanting to take any undue risks [the intelligence service] has decided to intervene at a very early stage in order to interrupt the planning and the actual assassination,\" the statement by Jakob Scharf, the agency's director general, said. \"Thus, this morning's operation must first and foremost be seen as a preventive measure where the aim has been to stop a crime from being committed.\" The uproar over the cartoons ignited after the Danish newspaper published caricatures of Islam's Prophet Mohammed. Some Muslims believe it is forbidden by the Quran to show an image of the prophet. Demonstrations erupted across the world in early 2006 after other newspapers reprinted the images months later as a matter of free speech. Some turned deadly. Many protesters directed their ire at Denmark, prompting the closure of several Danish embassies in predominantly Muslim countries, including Indonesia and Pakistan. Westergaard's cartoon depicted the prophet wearing a bomb as a turban with a lit fuse. Westergaard said he wanted his cartoon to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terror. However, many in the Muslim world interpreted the drawing as depicting their prophet as a terrorist. \"Of course I fear for my life after the Danish Security and Intelligence Service informed me of the concrete plans of certain people to kill me,\" Westergaard said in a statement posted on the newspaper's Web site. \"However, I have turned fear into anger and indignation. It has made me angry that a perfectly normal everyday activity which I used to do by the thousand was abused to set off such madness.\" CNN's Paula Newton said the arrests reinforced growing fears in Europe that radical Islam was trying to suppress free speech. \"More and more Europeans feel that Islam is a threat to their way of life,\" Newton said. A recent Gallup poll for the World Economic Forum showed a majority of Europeans believed relations between the West and the Muslim world were worsening. According to the poll this sentiment was strongest held among Danish. Westergaard remains under police protection and does not know whether it will continue. \"I could not possibly know for how long I have to live under police protection; I think, however, that the impact of the insane response to my cartoon will last for the rest of my life,\" he said. \"It is sad indeed, but it has become a fact of my life.\" Carsten Juste, the paper's editor-in-chief, said staffers have been \"deeply worried\" for several months. \"The arrests have hopefully thwarted the murder plans,\" he said on the newspaper's Web site.

But she wasn't looking for the perfect safari lodge. She was hunting for the right cosmetic surgeon. When she told her family, it wasn't an easy sell. \"South Africa? You're going to get some kind of witch doctor,\" she recalls her father saying. \"But I told him they perfected some of the first heart surgeries down there. To me, South Africa had the most reputable surgeons.\" Hiltbrunner, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, traveled to Johannesburg in 2004 for a face-lift, upper arm lift and eyelid surgery. And she and her husband -- who hadn't taken a vacation in 20 years -- went on a luxury safari, included in the package by medical-travel agency Surgeon and Safari. \"Medical tourism\" may sound strange, but patients are discovering they can get some cosmetic surgeries abroad for less than the U.S. price. And many surgeries include sightseeing packages. The roster of countries in which hospitals and surgeons are marketing their services to foreigners is growing. South Africa, Argentina, Thailand, Brazil, Costa Rica, India and Singapore have become major players. Robert Painter, a travel writer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, journeyed last year to Argentina for dental surgeries -- and tango lessons: \"If I'm going to be stuck somewhere for two weeks at a time, twice, Buenos Aires has got to be the best possible place,\" he says . Painter's procedures were organized by Plenitas, a medical-travel facilitator in Buenos Aires, which booked him at a hotel with a dance studio in the back. He wasn't the only guest getting surgery: \"While I was there, there was a young lady who was also having implants -- though not of the dental type.\" Cost-cutting pros and cons . Cosmetic, or elective, procedures aren't covered by insurance, so cost remains the motivating factor for most medical tourists. Surgeries in many countries cost half or even one-fifth what they would in the U.S. -- including airfare, hotel and excursions. \"A full face-lift that would cost $20,000 in the U.S. runs about $1,250 in South Africa,\" a 2005 article in U-Daily, the University of Delaware's online news service noted. Faith Richter, of Hope Sound, Florida, got a face-lift in Bangkok, Thailand. Her trip was organized by New York City's Med Journeys. \"In the U.S., it would have cost $20,000 for the procedure alone, with no time in the hospital,\" she says. In Bangkok, Richter was in the hospital four days, and the total cost of her 19-day trip, including sightseeing and airfare for two, was $10,600. Painter estimates he saved $18,000 on his surgeries. \"Cost was the primary factor,\" he says. \"The only factor.\" Medical costs abroad are less than in the U.S. for many reasons -- favorable exchange rates, lower salaries and fewer medical lawsuits, which means lower malpractice-insurance costs. But the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery warns against low-cost surgery. \"Get bargains on your shoes and laundry detergent, not on your face,\" says spokesman Tony Staffieri. \"Researching the quality of doctors should be a patient's primary consideration, but it isn't always,\" he says. \"Some people think 'tummy tuck and shopping.' This is not makeup; it's somebody cutting you.\" Some medical professionals fear that patients will overlook the severity of invasive surgeries and fail to ask the right questions. More casual attitudes toward plastic surgery -- spurred by lunch-break Botox treatments and same-day liposuctions, paired with temptingly cheap alternatives and vacation packages -- increase the risk of bad outcomes. Even stateside, cosmetic surgery can have tragic results. \"First Wives Club\" author Olivia Goldsmith died during a chin-tuck in 2004, and this year Kanye West's mother, Donda, died after a tummy tuck and breast reduction. However, a 2004 study published in the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, found that \"deaths occurring at office-based surgery facilities (in the U.S.) are rare -- less than a quarter of a percent.\" Quality surgeons . Medical tourism experts counter criticism by saying that cheaper prices don't necessarily mean lower quality of care. \"In general, it is the hospitals and facilities that have justifiable claim to 'world-class' status or to meeting or exceeding U.S. standards that are competing for patients from the United States and other countries,\" says Jeff Schult, author of \"Beauty from Afar: A Medical Tourist's Guide to Affordable and Quality Cosmetic Care Outside the U.S.\" The authors of a 2006 \"New England Journal of Medicine\" article confirm the high standards of internationally accredited hospitals: \"We doubt (...) that the average U.S. hospital can offer better outcomes for common complex operations.\" \"Almost 80 percent of the doctors we use have been trained in the U.S. or U.K.,\" says Tim Wallace, vice president of sales and marketing for Med Journeys. \"It gives the American consumer a degree of confidence.\" Richter, a registered nurse, agrees that standards are high abroad. \"After the surgery, the nurses were there for me 100 percent,\" she says. \"At home, we're so understaffed and overburdened, and inundated with paperwork.\" When Painter visited U.S. dentists, \"I felt like I was being processed for a home loan,\" he says. \"In Argentina, I had three dentists working on me at once.\" While medical tourism continues to increase in popularity, it's still not mainstream. When Richter left for Bangkok, she \"didn't tell a soul, not even my seven children, who are almost all in the medical field. They would have had a stroke. \"At Thanksgiving, though, they were all saying, 'You really do look good.'\" E-mail to a friend . LifeWire provides original and syndicated content to web publishers.

The 1-ton creature is believed to have been about 3 meters in length and 1.5 meters tall. The fossilized skull of the new giant rodent . The giant rat's skull, which measures an impressive 53 centimeters in diameter was found by Andr\u00e9s Rinderknecht and Ernesto Blanco, two scientists from Montevideo, Uruguay. The two paleontologists stumbled upon the fossilized remains in a broken boulder in San Jose along the coast of Uruguay. By looking at the size ratios of the skulls and bodies of existing rodents, scientists determined the bodyweight of the rodent must have approached 1,000 kilograms or a ton, making it the world's largest rodent to have been discovered to date. The relatively small size of its teeth however, suggests it fed mainly upon soft vegetables and fruit. \"We can give an educated guess that the rodent would have been 3 meters long -- assuming that it was similar to a Capybara (the largest rodent alive today) and taking it into account that large mammals generally have relatively smaller heads. It's tail probably was closer to the one of capybara or guinea pig (very short) and not like a rat,\" Ernesto Blanco says. The scientists believe the rodent, named Josephoartigasia monesi, roamed the earth about four million years ago at the same time as other giant creatures, such as terror birds, saber-toothed cats, ground sloths and giant armored mammals.

In a video released Sunday, Benazir Bhutto, far right, appears through the sunroof before shots ring out. It was a violation of Pakistani criminal law and prevented a medical conclusion about what killed the former prime minister, said Athar Minallah, who serves on the board that manages Rawalpindi General Hospital. However, the police chief involved, Aziz Saud, told CNN that he suggested an autopsy be done, but that Bhutto's husband objected. The revelation came on Monday after new videotape of Bhutto's assassination emerged, showing her slumping just after gunshots rang out. The tape provided the clearest view yet of the attack and appeared to show that Bhutto was shot. That would contradict the Pakistan government's account. Read Bhutto's full medical report . A previously released videotape showed a man at the right of her vehicle raising a gun, pointing it toward Bhutto, who was standing in her car with her upper body through the sunroof.

Bhutto fell into the car, then came the blast.  Watch new tape showing apparent gunman \u00bb . These images seem to support the theory that Bhutto died at the hands of a shooter before a bomb was detonated, killing another 23 people. Doctors at Rawalpindi General Hospital declared the 54-year-old dead hours after Thursday's attack, but the cause of her death has been widely debated. Pakistan's Interior Ministry announced on Friday that Bhutto died from a skull fracture suffered when she fell or ducked into the car as a result of the shots or the explosion and crashed her head onto a sunroof latch.  See the likely sequence of events \u00bb . Bhutto's family and political party maintain that the government is lying, and insist she died from gunshot wounds. Bhutto's husband, in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday, called for an international investigation into his wife's death, saying the new video proves the Pakistani government \"has been trying to muddy the water from the first day.\" \"Everything is now very clear that she was shot,\" Asif Ali Zardari said. Zardari also called on the U.S. government to push for an international probe. \"I want them to help me find out who killed my wife, the mother of my children,\" he said of the Bush administration. Javed Iqbal Cheema, spokesman for Pakistan's Interior Ministry, said the government's conclusion on Bhutto's death was based on \"absolute facts, nothing but the facts\" and \"it was corroborated by the doctor's report.\" But Minallah issued an open letter on Monday and released the doctors' clinical notes to distance them from the government statement, and he also talked to CNN. In the letter, Minallah said the doctors \"suggested to the officials to perform an autopsy,\" but that Saud \"did not agree.\" He noted that under the law, police investigators have \"exclusive responsibility\" in deciding to have an autopsy. Minallah told CNN that he was speaking out because the doctors at the hospital were \"threatened.\" \"They are government servants who cannot speak; I am not,\" he said. He did not elaborate on the threats against the doctors. He said the lack of an autopsy has created \"a perception that there is some kind of cover-up, though I might not believe in that theory.\" \"There is a state within the state, and that state within the state does not want itself to be held accountable,\" Minallah said. Cheema said the government had no objection to Bhutto's body being exhumed for an autopsy if the family requested it. Her widower has said the family was against exhumation because it did not trust the government. Minallah said the family could not have prevented an autopsy at the hospital without getting an order from a judge. The three-page medical report, which was signed by seven doctors, described Bhutto's head wound, but it did not conclude what caused it. It noted that X-ray images were made after she was declared dead. The wound was described as an irregular oval of about 5 centimeters by 3 centimeters above her right ear. \"Sharp bones edges were felt in the wound,\" it read. \"No foreign body was felt in the wound.\" E-mail to a friend .

The \"Barbie Bandits\" helped their hometown earn the dubious distinction as the nation's bank robbery capital. Here one of the so-called \"Barbie Bandits\" is captured on surveillance video at a surburban Atlanta bank. Atlanta's FBI field division topped Los Angeles in reporting the most bank heists, with 350 for the 12 months ending September 30, 2007, according to the FBI, which annually names areas most prone to bank robberies. The Los Angeles area was No. 2 with 338 heists, followed by Philadelphia with 316. Just Thursday, two suspects overpowered a security guard at an Atlanta, Georgia, bank, took his gun, robbed the bank and fled with money in hand, police said. Eventually, police shot one of the suspects in an exchange of gunfire. Two more armed bank robberies took place in metro Atlanta Friday. The FBI says violent crime is up across the nation, especially in major metro areas like Atlanta. So it's no surprise Atlanta has become a prime target for bank robberies, FBI spokesman Stephen Emmett told CNN.  Watch Hotlanta or Heistlanta? \u00bb . \"This goes hand in hand with those figures,\" Emmett said. Atlanta's rapid growth over the last decade has also been a factor. A recent Atlanta Business Chronicle article reported that metro Atlanta has 26 more banks than in all of North Carolina -- roughly one bank for every 3,500 people in the region.  See photos of bank heists in metro Atlanta \u00bb . \"We would attribute a lot of that [bank robberies] to the growth and the fact that the banking industry has matched that growth with an increase in bank branches throughout the area,\" Emmett said. Atlanta's rise in bank heists comes just as Los Angeles has aggressively countered once out-of-control bank robberies. Los Angeles has gone from more than 500 bank robberies in the mid-2000s to this year's 338, the FBI stats show. According to the FBI, its Atlanta field division reported 350 bank robberies in the last year -- the most notorious of which were the \"Barbie Bandits\" and \"Grandpa Bandit\" robberies. The FBI says 122 of the heists were armed robberies, or robberies where a weapon was visibly used. Emmett said many more of the robberies were what law enforcement officers classify as \"note jobs\" -- where a robber gestures as if he or she has a gun on them in a demand note handed over to the teller. Also factored into the total number of robberies were ATM heists and a record nine armored car robberies. Those armored car robberies are particularly disturbing to Emmett. \"Anyone that would confront an armored car courier knowing that he's already armed and in somewhat of a defensive posture, that mindset is very troubling for law enforcement,\" he said. While Emmett said there is no \"typical\" bank robber, he said he has seen some trends, most notably that they are often people battling drug addictions. He also said bank robbers are often repeat offenders. Two recent high-profile cases in Atlanta seem to confirm that. Two women dubbed the \"Barbie Bandits\" were arrested after working with a bank employee to rob a Bank of America in the Atlanta suburb of Acworth. They both later admitted to police to having drug addiction problems. Recently apprehended 69-year-old Bobby Joe Phillips, dubbed the \"Grandpa Bandit,\" is suspected to have robbed seven banks in Tennessee and the Atlanta area and had a criminal history. Emmett says typically very little money is taken in a bank heist. Joe Brannen, president of the Georgia Bankers Association, agrees, saying \"the average is $2,000 to $3,000. It's not as big a payoff as most people think it is.\" With the holidays in full swing, authorities are steeling themselves for a spate of bank robberies with robbers looking for quick holiday cash. \"I would make the assumption that a large part of it is the increased [financial] pressures this time of year,\" said Brannen. The FBI advises banks to be extra vigilant this time of year and to keep a close eye on jittery individuals donning gloves, hats and sunglasses. But Brannen says profiling people like that can be problematic. \"We've chosen not to go there. Here in Atlanta, lots of people wear head coverings for religious purposes. This is a free and open society,\" he said. He said customers want to come into a bank unimpeded -- that 99.9 percent are just customers, not bank robbers. Brannen says banks do all they can to balance convenience for their customers and the bank's need for security. \"There is no good, magic solution.\" he says. Emmett said as long as metro Atlanta continues to grow, so will the number of bank robberies. \"This is something that is part of growth. We have more banks. We have more people. We're a big city now.\" E-mail to a friend .

It was in his collection in California. The original of this Norman Rockwell reproduction was found in the collection of Steven Spielberg last year. Spielberg wasn't the thief, and he doesn't know who took Rockwell's \"Russian Schoolroom\" -- an oil of 16 pupils looking at a bust of Lenin. All the A-list director knows is he paid about $200,000 for the 16 x 37 canvas in a legitimate purchase. The FBI says its just one example of how pilfered art lands in  respectable places. And it was an uncommon ending for stolen art -- someone found it. Recovering masterpieces happens in less than 5 percent of cases, said Bonnie Magness-Gardiner, the FBI's Art Theft Program manager. Usually, expensive pieces go missing. No one knows who took them. No one gets prosecuted, and everyone wonders, \"Why steal something you can't turn to cash quickly?\" Art thieves do a simple risk versus reward evaluation, said Corine Wegener, associate curator of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. Thieves know that \"even if they receive only a fraction of the work's market value, the cash gained was at low risk of death or injury -- museums can be a relatively soft target,\" said Wegener, who's teaching a University of Minnesota class this month on art theft. But it could be years -- or never -- before the thief sees even a small payoff. In 1990, robbers took $300 million worth of certified masterpieces -- among them Rembrandt's \"Storm on the Sea of Galilee\" and Vermeer's \"The Concert\" -- from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, Massachusetts. No one's seen them since. On Sunday, robbers made off with one of the biggest art hauls in European history, grabbing four paintings worth an estimated $163 million from the E.G. Buehrle Collection in Zurich, Switzerland. They took works by Paul Cezanne, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh.  See what robbers grabbed in Switzerland \u00bb . \"These paintings are extremely valuable on the open market, but they'll never go onto the open market. So at the same time they're both priceless and worthless,\" said Charles Hill, the former chief of Scotland Yard's art and antiques unit. \"Some thieves may buy into the myth that a wealthy but unscrupulous collector will contact them and offer to take the art off their hands,\" Wegener said. \"When this doesn't happen, the thieves often try to ransom the art back to the museum or the insurance company.\" One London art dealer, who said he has handled stolen works, told CNN on condition of anonymity that an insurance company would rather get art back at a fraction of its original price than pay the owner its insured value.  Watch how art thieves operate \u00bb . Ransoming art to an insurance company through an intermediary adds \"up to 10 percent of the market value, which ... given the art market, is quite a lot of money,\" the dealer said. David Vuillaume, secretary general of the Swiss Museums Association, told Time magazine that ransom may be what the thieves behind the Swiss heist want. \"We are thinking that maybe in a week or two there will be a ransom demand. But we just have to wait and see,\" Time quoted him as saying. The museum has offered $90,000 reward for information leading to their recovery, Time reported. Options for art thieves . Julian Radcliffe, chairman of the Art Loss Register, which operates a database to help recover lost and stolen art, said ransom or reward are unlikely to bring results. \"It is very seldom that people have been able to undertake a ransom,\" he said. \"This gang might think that a reward has been offered, and that they'll get the reward.\" But in fact, \"the reward won't be paid unless someone is arrested, or there is proper criminal intelligence,\" and that's unlikely to happen, Radcliffe said. He said the thieves may just be patient, willing to get their payoff decades later. Or the art may move through an underground network, gradually increasing in value, before being slipped back onto the legitimate market. Take Spielberg. He bought \"Schoolroom\" in an above-the-board transaction. \"Usually, these pictures will change hands in the criminal underworld at a fraction -- 1 percent or less -- of their true market value,\" Radcliffe said, before someone tries to get them back into the international market. In such an effort, the seller may hope the work has been forgotten over time or they may disguise it as a copy or student re-creation. \"They may try and sell them not as being by Degas, but as being a copy, or school, or by a follower of one of the great artists. And that is the ways in which they try and get them on the market,\" Radcliffe said. The original thieves rarely face justice, the FBI's Magness-Gardiner said. \"The stolen items turn up years, sometimes decades, after the theft,\" she said. \"Because a work of art does not require a title document in order to be transferred from one owner to another, a stolen object easily enters the legitimate stream of commerce. \"It is impossible to trace them back to the original thief in most cases. Even if the original thief can be identified, there is also a statute of limitations on prosecution for theft,\" Magness-Gardiner said. What happens to stolen art? Even if the art is recovered, original owners may not get it back. While museum pieces are likely to go back to their collections, private owners may not be so lucky. \"Russian Schoolroom\" remains in Spielberg's possession while courts determine the rightful owner, a spokesman for the director said. But art stolen from a Los Angeles mansion and sold in Sweden remains with its Swedish purchasers, according to a case file posted on the Web site of the Los Angeles Police Department's Art Theft Detail. Even though the thief was caught, \"the Swedish government refused to return the paintings, claiming that according to Swedish law, the auction buyers had purchased the paintings in good faith,\" according to the Web site. In the case of Rockwell's \"Russian Schoolroom,\" someone took it from a gallery in Clayton, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb, in 1973, according to an FBI synopsis of the case. In 2004, The FBI's Art Crime Team found out that the piece had been for sale at a New York Rockwell exhibition 15 years earlier and posted a picture and description of the painting on its art recovery Web site. Spielberg's staff learned of the search and told the FBI that Spielberg had it in his collection in Los Angeles. He had purchased it from a legitimate dealer in 1989, an FBI press release said. The agency also determined the painting was auctioned in New Orleans in 1988, but it has yet to determine who took the painting or its whereabouts from 1973 to 1988. Whoever took \"Russian Schoolroom\" from the suburban St. Louis gallery in 1973, or the masterpieces from the Boston museum 1980, or the works lifted in Zurich this week, shouldn't be mistaken for a high-society, tuxedo-wearing, \"Thomas Crown Affair\" kind of thief, Radcliffe said. \"These people are the worst sort of criminal. They are just like the criminals who traffic individuals or sell children, or murder. \"They are thoroughly unpleasant people. There is no romanticism in anyway that should be connected to it.\" E-mail to a friend .

Sampras enjoyed the spoils of victory in Macau after two previous defeats to Federer. Federer had one the two previous clashes in an Asian series in straight sets but was handed a 7-6 6-4 defeat in the finale. American ace Sampras downplayed his victory, noting Federer was coming off a long season and that he was helped by his big serve and the fast indoor carpet surface. He had only aimed to win one set during the three-match series. \"Let's not get carried away,\" he said at a news conference. Sampras ruled out a comeback from retirement, telling the audience after the match, \"I had my time in the 90s.\" Federer tried to put on a positive spin on the loss, saying he wasn't embarrassed to lose to his idol, but still showed some disappointment. \"It's been tough beating my idol the last two times. I'm happy that he got me at least once,\" he said, but adding, \"I hope we can do it again in the future. I'd like to get him back.\" The two players have won a combined 26 Grand Slam titles, but Sampras, 36, retired five years ago after winning the U.S. Open in 2002. Federer is coming off another outstanding season in which he won three grand slams and last week's Masters Cup in Shanghai. \"I'm sort of surprised. This guy can play tennis, you know,\" the Swiss player said after his loss Saturday. Federer beat Sampras 6-4 6-3 in Seoul on Tuesday and edged the American 7-6 7-6 in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday. In Macau, Federer was never able able to force a break point on the powerful Sampras serve, but had set points at 6-5 and 8-7 in the tiebreak. But Sampras saved both and a run of three points, capped by a forehand winner, gave him the opener. The ninth game of the second second proved vital as a forehand error by Federer gave Sampras a break point which he gratefully took with another fine forehand. Sampras closed out the match as a Federer backhand return sailed long. Federer said he thought Sampras could still beat the world's top five players on a fast surface. Sampras then predicted that Federer could beat his record of most grand slam wins (14) \"if not next year, pretty soon.\" \"He's a great, great player.

Construction workers unearthed ancient walls in the busy Iztapalapa neighborhood in June, and government archeologists said Wednesday they believe they may be part of the main pyramid of the Aztec city, destroyed by conquistador Hernan Cortes in the 16th century. Iztapalapa, now infamous for violent crime and drug dealing, has grown into a sprawling, poor district of the capital, obscuring the ruins. \"We knew the general location but couldn't explore because it's a big urban area,\" said government archeologist Jesus Sanchez, who is director of the site. Iztapalapa's ruler, Cuitlahuac, nearly annihilated Cortes and his Spanish troops in 1520 in what became known as the Sad Night. After eventual victory, Cortes destroyed the city. Sanchez hopes he has found the city's main pyramid just below the neighborhood's central plaza and garden. He and his team will spend more than a year investigating before deciding whether to excavate. Mexico City is littered with pre-Hispanic ruins. In October, archeologists in the city's central Zocalo square unearthed a 15th century Aztec altar and a 12-ton stone idol just yards from choking downtown traffic. The Aztecs, a warlike and deeply religious people who built monumental works, ruled an empire stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean and encompassing much of modern-day central Mexico.

The protesters, which witnesses said numbered close to 1,000, swore to fight in the name of their prophet. Gillian Gibbons, 54, was given 15 days in jail late Thursday after she was convicted of insulting religion. She was cleared of charges of inciting hatred and showing contempt for religious beliefs, her lawyer, Ali Ajeb, said. Ajeb said they planned to appeal the sentence, which begins from the date she was detained, Nov. 25. Including Friday, she has 10 more days in jail. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said he was \"extremely disappointed\" that the charges were not dismissed. Meanwhile senior British lawmakers were en route to Khartoum to try to secure Gibbons' early release.

Veronique Robert, mother of the 15-year-old French-Swiss teen, speaking outside a court in Dubai. The boy's mother, Veronique Robert, was visibly upset after the sentence was read and promised to appeal. Robert, a French journalist, brought the case to the media's attention in recent months in an effort to shed light on what she deemed to be injustices in the pro-Western emirate of Dubai. Robert said Wednesday's sentence was too lenient for a crime that she believes is tantamount to attempted murder because one of her son's attackers was knowingly HIV-positive at the time of the rape. She refrained from asking the death penalty for her son's attackers, but said she hoped the sentence would be much longer. A spokesman for the Dubai government, Habib al Mulla, told CNN the sentence was in accordance with international standards and was not lenient. \"Today's verdict has proven that the system is efficient and is fair to all parties involved,\" al Mulla said. The case began in July, when the two men, 36 and 18, kidnapped and raped the French teenager at knifepoint. Robert contacted French diplomats, who took up the allegations with Dubai authorities. Al Mulla said police action was swift and arrests were made within 24 hours. But Robert has said the case was botched from the start, beginning with her son's examination by a doctor who said her son was gay. Homosexuality in Dubai is illegal, and the teen could have faced as much as a year in prison. Robert's son has since returned to France and was not in court for Wednesday's sentencing. Robert has also said Dubai authorities repeatedly concealed evidence -- confirmed in court papers -- that one of the attackers was HIV-positive. Robert said her son, who is still awaiting test results to find out whether he has the virus, could have gotten treatment much sooner had they known. Dubai authorities deny any evidence was concealed. The case has shed light on Dubai's attitudes toward rape and homosexuality, which some Western observers have said is outdated. Al Mulla, however, said Wednesday's sentencing and the government's handling of the case proves the country's system works. \"It's today's verdict which proves that there is a system,\" al Mulla said. \"The system is working properly. However, if there is any room for any improvement in the system, we'll definitely look into it, consider it, and if there's any room for improvement, we'll implement it.\" The mother has already filed suit in courts in Paris and Geneva, Switzerland seeking compensation from Sheikh Khalifa, president of the United Arab Emirates, and the prime minister and vice president of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum. She is also suing others, including the Dubai police chief. Robert started a Web site over the summer, boycottdubai.com, demanding better treatment for children who suffer sexual assault there. At a press conference last month, she proclaimed, \"We are here because I just would like first justice for my son; and second for every girl and boy who was raped and even had no chance to speak.\" Robert said she will drop all her pending cases if the government sets up rape clinics, recognizes the status of rape victims, and takes precautions after rape against sexually-transmitted diseases. In the wake of Wednesday's verdict, Robert said a Dubai government official told her the emirate plans to open its first rape clinic, which she said was a small victory. The government has not yet officially announced its plans to open such a facility. Al Mulla told CNN that Dubai believes a reception center for rape victims is \"a good solution.\" \"We are considering it,\" he said, regarding Robert's request. \"We believe it's good. It's good for the victims, and it's good for the whole system.\"  E-mail to a friend .

They have bickered over the rich Pacific coast fishing waters for years, and Peru published a new map on Sunday that pushes its bid to negotiate a new sea border. Chile's government protested the move and said it was calling home its ambassador in Peru, Cristian Barros, for consultations. \"We feel that this type of publication (map) and this position certainly make more difficult a fluid bilateral relationship with the Peruvian government,\" spokesman Ricardo Lagos Weber said on Monday. \"Chile will continue to fully exercise its rights and competencies over Chilean territory,\" he said. Peruvian President Alan Garcia said in June his country would take Chile to the International Court at The Hague to resolve the case. Peru's foreign minister, Jose Antonio Garcia Belaunde, sought to downplay the row. \"It is an absolutely common diplomatic practice in novel situations like this that garner attention that ambassadors are called (back to report),\" he said. \"The channels of dialogue and communication must be kept open, and the countries must work toward a positive agenda,\" Garcia Belaunde said. The sea border, set in the 1950s, starts close to the land border and cuts due west across the ocean. But Peru says it was non-binding and rob it of 14,630 square miles (37,900 sq km) of fishing waters. Its proposed border is a southwestern sloping line that follows the diagonal land border into the Pacific Ocean. Analysts say Peru will have its day in court and the Hague is the only venue for the issue to be resolved, unless something happens to escalate the debate. \"The only thing that could happen, which would be very worrisome, would be if some autonomous group carried out some kind of act of sovereignty (in those waters) now that Peru officially claims them. That would be a shame,\" said Ricardo Israel, a political analyst in Chile. Chile defeated Peru in the 1879-1883 War of the Pacific and seized a chunk of mineral-rich territory from its northern neighbor. The two countries have strong economic ties but relations are still rocky. The dispute over their sea border has bubbled anew over the past two years and comes in addition to less serious disputes over the origins of everything from a dessert and a fruit to pisco, a grape liquor. Peru and Chile are the world's top producers of fish meal, a cattle feed, and fishing is one of the engines of Peru's economy. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

In his veto message, Bush said the bill is almost a duplicate of the proposal he spiked in October. \"Because the Congress has chosen to send me an essentially identical bill that has the same problems as the flawed bill I previously vetoed, I must veto this legislation, too,\" he said in a statement released by the White House. The bill would have expanded the State Children's Health Insurance Program by nearly $35 billion over five years, the same as the measure Bush vetoed October 3.  Track recent and historical presidential vetoes \u00bb . The president had proposed adding $5 billion to the program and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded, state-run program. Democratic leaders said the new version addressed Republican objections by tightening restrictions on illegal immigrants receiving SCHIP benefits, capping the income levels of families that qualify for the program and preventing adults from receiving benefits. Though the measure had strong bipartisan support, it fell short of the two-thirds majorities needed to override a presidential veto in the House and Senate. House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Democrats were more interested in scoring political points with the veto than in reaching a compromise with Republicans. \"We could have resolved the differences in his program in 10 minutes, if the majority had wanted to resolve the differences,\" Boehner said. \"This has become a partisan political game.\" The program currently covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid -- the federal health insurance program for the poor -- but who can't afford private insurance. Democrats wanted to extend the program to another 4 million, paying for it with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes. \"What a sad day that the president would say that rather than insuring [millions of] children, 'I don't want to raise the cigarette tax,' \" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She called for a January 23 vote on whether to override the veto. Meanwhile, Bush called on Congress to extend funding for the current program to keep the 6 million now covered on the rolls.

Mohammed Alshaya, CEO of Alshaya's retail division, tells MME he sees a new mindset in the Gulf . Topshop, Coast, NEXT and River Island are just some of the big names he's imported from the United Kingdom to shopping centers in the Middle East. As chief executive of M.H. Alshaya, he knows what sells: tried and tested Western brands that will appeal to local shoppers. And his empire is not limited to clothing. In the past month, he's taken Mothercare and The Body Shop to Central Eastern Europe. With the addition of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, M.H. Alshaya now operates in 16 markets including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Cyprus, Turkey, Poland and Russia. John Defterios spoke with Mohammed Alshaya, and started by asking him for his thoughts on the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) plans for a single currency. (JD): I would imagine as a retail operation you'd be a huge proponent of a single currency within the GCC. Is it realistic within the next 4 to 5 years? (MA): I think it can be, as long as there is a will of the leaders to get together and decide. It is a huge leap towards efficiency, conciliation, getting closer between the six countries. One single Central Bank that governs and regulates is much better than the current six, I believe. (JD): Have you ever done any calculations of what impact it would have on your back office operations? (MA): Not yet, but it will be great, I think. (JD): You're one of the largest retail operations throughout the Arabian Peninsula. With all this growth that we're seeing right now, it must have a direct impact on the retail sector. What sort of annual growth are you experiencing? (MA): We're experiencing close to 25 percent annual growth, if not 30 percent in some cases, like in Dubai. (JD): Do you have any sort of concerns that this is going to be a bubble like the 1970s where the money was not deployed correctly? It seems different from my vantage point, do you share that view? (MA): There is a new generation of people from the region that are leading businesses and strong leadership in the government that have mitigated any concern. And if you see now the statistics, the Gulf is the seventh largest economy in the world. In ten, in 15 years time, it will be the fifth. So I see a new mindset, a new attitude. (JD): One of the other things I wanted to ask you about is your moves into other countries. The Alshaya group is very well known throughout the Arabian Peninsula, but you're moving into other markets, into Eastern Europe, specifically into Russia. Do you have the expertise to go into these markets? (MA): Well, yes. We have the expertise, and the expertise is by really retaining good management, and traveling with them into new markets. I'm not going to open shops myself. We have a very strong team in Russia; Russians that are taking our investment into good projects like Starbucks which we opened two months ago, two stores. We acquired a business there. So we have plans like Mothercare, Bodyshop, NEXT. (JD): So you can basically move this group into any city and have that potpourri of offers? (MA): We have the software. We have the software to launch the retail portfolio into a new market. (JD): Obviously you're a family business. You feel quite strongly about preserving culture and the family structure, and the need for family businesses to create jobs, because they represent 75 percent of all turnover in the Gulf. (MA): We have a social responsibility toward our people. We have to make sure we have jobs for them if the government is not going to compete, and is going to take away some of the people who would be relevant to our business. Another issue that might challenge us to do that is the wealth creation -- whether (potential employees) would be attracted to be in a department store selling or in a coffee shop making coffee -- that, we will see.

Two U.S. Air Force F-15s were dispatched to meet the Russian bombers. U.S. radar picked up the Russian turbo-prop Tupolev-95 planes about 500 miles off the Alaska coast. The U.S. fighters from Elmendorf Air Force Base were dispatched to meet the bombers and escorted them out of the area without incident, the officials said. The United States maintains the air exclusion zone off the coast of Alaska, barring unidentified aircraft or aircraft that don't file flight plans inside that area.

Then, four Bear bombers flew near the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, with one of them flying about 2,000 feet from the Nimitz's deck. Russia's Defense Ministry said at the time there was no violation of flight regulations during the incident. A ministry official described the flights as standard operating procedure for air force training. Meanwhile, U.S. military officials say the incidents are not a concern.

The sacrifice is just part of his job, he says, and he'd go back to Iraq in a second if asked. Jeffrey Jamaleldine left Germany for college in America. In 2006, he joined the U.S. Army. That is something that troubles his family, especially his father. Jamaleldine served in the U.S. Army as a German citizen, one of an estimated 20,500 \"green-card warriors\" in the military. Last month, Jamaleldine was awarded U.S. citizenship, but he's keeping his German passport. Bashir Jamaleldine says his son is fighting an unjust war for an America that went too far when it invaded Iraq five years ago -- a sentiment shared by the majority of Germans. He wishes his son would get back to his \"German roots.\" \"It would satisfy me more. Why he's more American than a German, I don't know,\" he says. Of his son's time in Iraq, the father says, \"He went there to receive this bullet. If he would not have gone there, he wouldn't have been wounded; he wouldn't be in the hospital; he wouldn't be treated by a doctor. He would be living in peace with his family.\" Shaking his head with his son at his side, he adds, \"He is more American than German.\" Jeffrey Jamaleldine, a 31-year-old U.S. Army scout who proudly wears a Stetson hat and spurs on his boots, laughs. He says he and his dad have had countless arguments over his decision to join the U.S. military, but the two never budge from their positions.  See his shattered jaw and debate with his dad \u00bb . \"He hears what I'm saying, but there's just no coming through,\" he says. The father came to Germany from Africa years ago. He says his son should be devoting his energy to fighting hunger and poverty in Africa, not fighting in Iraq. The son agrees with his father on one thing: His love for America is unwavering. Jeffrey Jamaleldine moved to the United States to go to college in Missouri at the age of 18 and immediately fell in love with the United States and its culture. \"You can go from rags to riches there. People still believe in that. It is not something that has gotten lost,\" he says. And when the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, happened, he felt it was time for him to do something. \"A small group of people [terrorists] -- I felt -- had a big influence on our way of life and that literally pissed me off,\" he says. By accident, he says he found out that with his green card, he could join the U.S. military. And in 2006, he did just that. Read why a \"green-card\" Marine would die for America . Last year, he paid a heavy price for his patriotism. Pinned down in a firefight with insurgents in the Iraqi city of Ramadi, Jamaleldine was shot in the face. \"I felt like I got hit by Mike Tyson,\" he says, pointing to a two-inch long scar on his left cheek. The left side his jaw was shattered and now doctors at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany are reconstructing his facial bones. \"Part of the projectile is still stuck in the right cheekbone,\" Dr. Edward Vanisky says. \"But if it doesn't cause you any problems, we'll just leave it in there.\" While many Americans would consider Jamaleldine a hero, most in his home country don't. Germans largely oppose the Iraq war. The criticism doesn't bother him.  Watch why a German would fight for U.S. \u00bb . He says even after getting wounded on the battlefield, he would go fight for America again if ordered back to Iraq. \"I still don't want to die, I love life, I enjoy life,\" he says. \"But I would still make the sacrifice to go to Iraq again if I am called. If I have to go, I will -- to stand up for what I believe in,\" he says. His father looks on in disbelief as he listens to his son, now an American citizen. But Jeffrey Jamaleldine says joining the military was never about that, it was about defending American ideals. \"If we have people who want to change those ideals or take them away,\" he says, \"then there are people like me or my platoon who stand up and fight for those ideals.\" E-mail to a friend .", "69788d586d71bf36d2818ca097308747f6ab25ab": "COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN) -- Oprah Winfrey delivered her \"favorite\" candidate in the presidential race something his campaign hoped for Sunday: the largest crowd yet of any event in the race to '08, according to the Obama campaign. Oprah campaigned with Obama this weekend in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Although exact figures were not immediately available, campaign officials estimated more than 30,000 people packed into Columbia, South Carolina's Williams-Brice stadium to hear the talk-show queen explain why she believes Obama is the man with the \"vision\" for America. \"Dr. King dreamed the dream. We get to vote that dream into reality by supporting a man who knows not just who we are but who we can be,\" she told the crowd. South Carolina is one of the first states in the nation to hold its presidential primary, making it key to the success of any presidential candidate. Winfrey gave a similar speech Saturday in the first stop of a two-day, three-state tour with her fellow Chicagoan. She discussed on Sunday stepping out of her \"comfort zone\" by entering the political scene on behalf of a candidate, and praised Obama's \"ear for eloquence and tongue for unvarnished truth. We need politicians to tell the truth and be the truth.\"  Watch what issues are important to Iowans \u00bb . She also said Obama would bring \"a sense of statesmanship\" to the White House.  Watch Winfrey endorse Obama \u00bb . After extensive thank-yous to his wife Michelle and to Winfrey -- and acknowledging that the crowd was largely there to see Winfrey, not him -- Obama launched into his stump speech. \"I am running because of what Dr. King called 'the fierce urgency of now,' \" he said. Covering ground from the Iraq war to the economy to health care, he said, \"there is such a thing as being too late -- and that hour is almost upon us.\" His campaign worked the crowd, passing out cards to sign up supporters and verifying that those who showed up are registered to vote. They handed out cards asking fans to provide their mailing addresses and phone numbers. The cards also featured an \"optional\" pledge to vote for Obama on January 26. In his speech, Obama did not mention his chief rival by name. But he clearly referred to Sen. Hillary Clinton, saying that if he gets the Democratic nomination, his Republican competitor won't be able to say he ever \"supported the Iraq war.\"  Watch how Winfrey's campaigning could give Obama a boost \u00bb . Clinton was among the Democrats who supported a resolution authorizing force in Iraq in 2002, though in a speech on the Senate floor she said she believed supporting the resolution could ultimately make war itself less likely. Obama was not in the Senate at the time, but gave a speech opposing the possibility of war with Iraq. Clinton has held a lead over Obama in South Carolina, where the Democratic primary consists largely of African-American voters. Clinton had a star of her own on the campaign trail for her Sunday in South Carolina -- her husband, former president Bill Clinton, who addressed a church in the morning.

An undated amateur photo shows Gillian Gibbons, who was jailed for allowing children to name a teddy bear \"Mohammed\". Gillian Gibbons, 54, was convicted last week of insulting religion and sentenced to 15 days in jail and deportation. Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir pardoned her from her prison sentence on Monday and she later left on a flight for England. The two sources said Sarah Khawad was fired as the school's secretary in November after an employment spat and threatened to shut down the school. The sources said Khawad did not appear to have a vendetta against Gibbons, but hoped that by bringing the teddy bear incident to the education minister's attention, he would close down the school for anti-Islamic teachings.  Watch Time magazine's Sam Dealey's report on the pardon \u00bb . The private school was shut down after the controversy came to light last week. It is unclear if it will reopen. Although there is no ban in the Quran on images of Allah or the Prophet Mohammed, Islam's founder, some Muslims consider likenesses highly offensive. The sources said they have confirmed the account with Gibbons. Defense attorneys confirmed that it was Khawad who launched the initial complaint against Gibbons, not a parent as originally thought. Khawad also testified at Gibbons' trial. Before approaching Sudan's education minister, the two sources said Khawad tried to enlist two parents, who were also teachers at the school, to join in her protest against the teddy bear's name, but they declined. Gibbons had been working at the school -- popular with wealthy Sudanese and expatriates -- since August, after leaving her position as deputy head teacher at a primary school in Liverpool this summer, said the head of Unity High School, Robert Boulos. She had asked her class of 7-year-olds to come up with a name for the toy as part of a school project, he said. Classmates took turns taking the teddy bear home with them, accompanied by a diary with the bear's name written in the front of it, he said. She was taken into custody on November 25 and tried days later in a Sudanese court. She was cleared of other charges of inciting hatred and showing contempt for religious beliefs. Gibbons had initially faced the possibility of 40 lashes and a six-month jail term for insulting Islam. The incident sparked a diplomatic row, with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband calling on his Sudanese counterpart to dismiss the charges. Two British lawmakers, both Muslims, traveled to Khartoum to help secure her release. It also resulted in angry protests in Khartoum, with some calling for the British woman's execution.

Debra Lafave was arrested after talking with a teenager. She is not allowed to have contact with anyone under 18. The association violated the terms of Lafave's probation, which forbade her to have contact with anyone under 18, the sheriff's office said. She was released on her own recognizance. Lafave and her mother, Joyce Beasley, had no comment as they left the jail. \"I can only characterize this as somewhat of a bizarre and unusual violation,\" said Lafave's attorney, John Fitzgibbons. Lafave, 27, pleaded guilty in November 2005 to having sex with a 14-year-old boy and was sentenced to three years under house arrest and seven years of probation. Lafave was also required to register as a sex offender and abide by numerous conditions. She was arrested after corrections officers interviewed a 17-year-old girl, who worked at a restaurant where Lafave had been employed since January 2006, according to the violation report from Florida's Corrections Department.  Watch Lafave's ex-husband discuss the allegations \u00bb . The teenager told the officers that Lafave discussed \"non-work related issues such as family problems, friends, high school, personal life, boyfriend issues and sexual issues in both private one-on-one conversations\" with her and in group settings, according to the report. \"I would characterize this simply as 'girl talk,' or 'guy talk,' if you will, among fellow employees, that all of us do every day,\" Fitzgibbons said. \"This is it. There's no more, there's no less. ... I would describe it as simply a workplace friendship.\" The co-worker will turn 18 on January 2, Fitzgibbons said. Lafave refused to make a statement regarding the allegations, the document said. She was ordered to quit the restaurant job and now works as a receptionist in her mother's barber shop, the report said. Lafave says she suffers from bipolar disorder and is receiving treatment. Fitzgibbons said his client has done everything required of her, living with her parents and leaving only to go to work. She has done so well on two years of house arrest, he said, that he has been planning to ask that the third year be waived. Fitzgibbons said he still intends to make that request, and hopes Lafave's arrest will not hurt that effort -- \"I would hope that the court would be understanding.\" \"She's really tried hard, so it's upsetting to her,\" he said of the arrest, but noted it was \"unheard of\" for someone on probation for a sexual offense to be released on her own recognizance.

Delta cancellations will affect flights up until early Friday, according to a statement from the airline. The cancellations will affect flights through Friday, according to statements by both companies. A spokeswoman for Delta earlier said 325 flights would be canceled Thursday, but later said 275 flights were cut. \"Delta apologizes in advance for any inconvenience this may cause and is working to proactively contact and reaccommodate affected customers. Customers should call ahead to check flight status,\" a Delta statement said. Wednesday, American Airlines canceled 318 flights, said company spokesman Tim Wagner. The airline canceled 132 of its estimated 2,300 flights scheduled for Thursday, Wagner said, about 6 percent of the daily schedule. The cancellations forced dozens of people to spend the night in the atrium of Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. They slept wherever they could -- on couches, on the floor, some on non-moving baggage carousels. Kelly said the airline rebooked flights and covered the cost of hotel and food for passengers on canceled flights. It was initially believed that Delta's MD-90 planes were part of the inspection but it was determined that the MD-88 planes were the only ones that needed to be inspected, a spokeswoman said. The airline said the checks are voluntary and are expected to be completed by week's end. American Airlines, meanwhile, is examining wiring secured to its MD-80 aircraft. In Atlanta, the cancellations caused grousing among passengers who missed job interviews, connecting flights and the comfort of their beds, CNN affiliate WXIA reported. \"They told us 6:45 (p.m.). Then they told us 7:30. Then 8, so on and so forth and they just canceled,\" passenger Fred Billizon told WXIA. \"So they had about 200 people just waiting on flights. And that's not a lot of happy people.\" This latest round of inspections was prompted by questions raised by the FAA and American safety officials about how a certain bundle of wires is secured to the MD-80 aircraft. The MD-80 is the workhorse of the American fleet. American's Web site says the aircraft accounts for 300 of the airline's fleet of 655 jets.

A crew member of the Alaska Ranger is taken on board the Coast Guard Cutter Munro. The Seattle, Washington-based Alaska Ranger was in 10-foot seas and winds of 30 to 35 miles per hour when it reported water was leaking into its steering gear compartment about 2:50 a.m. Sunday. The trawler had 47 people on board, said Chief Petty Officer Barry Lane, a Coast Guard spokesman. Four of those had been confirmed dead by late morning, Lane said. One person is still unaccounted for, said another Coast Guard spokesman, Lt. Eric Eggen.  Watch a report from Lt. Eggen \u00bb . The 180-foot processing trawler was about 120 miles west of Dutch Harbor, in the remote Aleutian Islands, when the crew reported being \"overwhelmed by water\" and abandoned ship, Eggen said. Most of the crew had survival suits to protect them from water that was near-freezing, said Cmdr. Todd Trimpert, a Coast Guard spokesman. No cause of death was immediately known for the four crew members who died, but \"certainly, they were in the water a long time,\" Trimpert said. \"Without a survival suit, generally your survival time is less than 30 minutes,\" he said. The company that owned the ship, The Fishing Company of Alaska Inc., identified the four who did not survive as Captain Eric Peter Jacobsen, Chief Engineer Daniel Cook, Mate David Silveira and Crewman Byron Carrillo. \"They were incredibly brave, hard-working men,\" the company said. \"Our hearts are broken.\" A nearby ship, the Alaska Warrior, rescued 25 crew members while the Coast Guard retrieved the rest of the crew, the company said. \"We do not have sufficient information to determine why the vessel foundered,\" the company said. \"We will do everything possible to find out what occurred with the hope that something can be learned that will be of value to the fishing community.\" Amy Roman, a niece of Daniel Cook, told CNN affiliate KING-TV that her uncle \"died how he wanted to. \"If you're a fisherman, you want to die out at sea,\" she said. \"If you're a true fisherman, this is how you want to go.\" Survivors were being taken aboard the Coast Guard cutter Munro. A helicopter and a C-130 transport plane were also taking part in the effort, the Coast Guard reported. The sinking left an unknown amount of diesel fuel on the surface of the Bering Sea, Lane said. The fishing industry is perennially among the most deadly in the United States. In 2005, 48 fishermen died, up from 38 the year before, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Ty Ziegel, a Marine, was badly wounded in Iraq. He battled the VA over disability benefits when he returned. He lost part of his skull in the blast and part of his brain was damaged. Half of his left arm was amputated and some of the fingers were blown off his right hand. Ziegel, a 25-year-old Marine sergeant, knew the dangers of war when he was deployed for his second tour in Iraq. But he didn't expect a new battle when he returned home as a wounded warrior: a fight with the Department of Veterans Affairs. \"Sometimes, you get lost in the system,\" he told CNN. \"I feel like a Social Security number. I don't feel like Tyler Ziegel.\" His story is one example of how medical advances in the battlefield have outpaced the home front. Many wounded veterans return home feeling that the VA system, specifically its 62-year-old disability ratings system, has failed them.  Watch Ziegel display his model skull \u00bb . \"The VA system is not ready, and they simply don't have time to catch up,\" Tammy Duckworth -- herself a wounded veteran who heads up the Illinois Department of Veteran Affairs -- told the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee in March. VA Acting Secretary Gordon Mansfield said cases like Ziegel's are rare -- that the majority of veterans are moving through the process and \"being taken care of.\" He also said most veterans are fairly compensated. \"Any veteran with the same issue, if it's a medical disability, ... it is going to get the same exact result anywhere in our system,\" he said. More than 28,500 troops have been wounded in Operation Iraqi Freedom, including about 8,500 that have needed air transport, according to the U.S. military.  See photos of these Iraq war heroes \u00bb . A recent Harvard study found that the cost of caring for those wounded over the course of their lifetime could ultimately cost more than $660 billion. In Ziegel's case, he spent nearly two years recovering at Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas. Once he got out of the hospital, he was unable to hold a job. He anticipated receiving a monthly VA disability check sufficient to cover his small-town lifestyle in Washington, Illinois. Instead, he got a check for far less than expected. After pressing for answers, Ziegel finally received a letter from the VA that rated his injuries: 80 percent for facial disfigurement, 60 percent for left arm amputation, a mere 10 percent for head trauma and nothing for his left lobe brain injury, right eye blindness and jaw fracture. \"I don't get too mad about too many things,\" he said. \"But once we've been getting into this, I'm ready to beat down the White House door if I need to.\" \"I'm not expecting to live in the lap of luxury,\" he added. \"But I am asking them to make it comfortable to raise a family and not have to struggle.\" Within 48 hours of telling his story to CNN this summer, the Office of then-VA Secretary Jim Nicholson acted on Ziegel's case. The VA changed his head trauma injury, once rated at 10 percent, to traumatic brain injury rated at 100 percent, substantially increasing his monthly disability check. Duckworth, the Illinois VA chief, knows exactly what Ziegel and other severely wounded vets are going through. She lost both her legs when a rocket-propelled grenade struck her Blackhawk helicopter on November 12, 2004. Her right arm was also shattered.  Watch how Duckworth's wounds changed her life \u00bb . She told CNN she received \"incredible care\" at Walter Reed for 13 months, but soon realized the transition to the VA wouldn't be as smooth. \"I started worrying about the fact that maybe this country won't remember in five years that there are these war wounded,\" Duckworth said. Garrett Anderson with the Illinois National Guard, for example, has been fighting the VA since October 15, 2005. Shrapnel tore through his head and body after a roadside bomb blew up the truck he was driving. He lost his right arm. The VA initially rejected his claim, saying his severe shrapnel wounds were \"not service connected.\"  Watch Anderson describe \"my arm was hanging there\" \u00bb . \"Who would want to tell an Iraqi or Afghanistan soldier who was blown up by an IED that his wounds were not caused by his service over there?\" said Anderson's wife, Sam. After pressure from Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the VA acted on Anderson's case. He has since been awarded compensation for a traumatic brain injury. \"It upsets me that the VA system operates in a way that it takes people of power -- and who you know and what you know -- to get what you want,\" said Anderson, who is now retired. When asked about Anderson's case specifically, the VA's Mansfield said such cases make him \"more dedicated\" to fixing the system. In July, President Bush and a commission appointed to review the care of veterans returning from war announced the need for a complete overhaul of the disability ratings system, which dates back to World War II. The VA is now considering action on the commission's recommendations. Ziegel eventually won his battle. Still he feels for so many others he believes are getting cheated by the system. \"We're feeding the war machine, but you never think of the war machine that comes home and needs, you know, feeding back home,\" he said. His family hopes they don't have to fight the VA again. In August, Ty Ziegel's brother, 22-year-old Zach Ziegel, was deployed to Iraq. \"I want to make the VA system better because if he has to go through anything I went through, that's really going to upset me. That'll make my fuse real short and hot,\" Ty Ziegel said. E-mail to a friend .", "9483ae6d83dd71a96e91eee727a9ce7c0f3cf6ab": "CNN Student News -- June 29, 2007 . Transcript .

It's gonna be the next kind of iPod. It's from SanDisk. It's called the Sansa Connect. That little bump is a WiFi antenna. This can connect wirelessly to the Internet or to other devices like it to share music, download music and stream Internet radio. That is really the future of iPod-like devices. If you want to give a phone, but you also want to give a music player, this one does both. NOKIA's 5300 Music Express is a great music player. It's not an iPod, but it's not bad. Transport controls and volume buttons out here tell you that it's something different. And then for a camera, I like this very flat Sony T100. It's pocket-size, which is very hot these days. Nice slide-down door. 8 mega pixels, image stabilization and a great big screen for sharing photos. WOLF: Brian Cooley of CNET.com, thank you so much. COOLEY: You bet. (END VIDEO CLIP) Shoutout . GEORGE RAMSAY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! When did the first iPod debut? If you think you know it, shout it out. Was it: A) 1997, B) 1999, C) 2001 or D) 2003? You've got three seconds -- Go! If you guessed C, you've got the right tune. The popular portable players first made the scene in the fall of 2001. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Tech in the Classroom . AZUZ: Whether it's an iPod, Sony, Samsung or Zune, it seems like you can't go anywhere these days without seeing people plugged in to some type of MP3 player. And if you're on a college campus, you might think students walking around with their ear buds in are listening to music. But don't be fooled. They could just be studying up for class. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AZUZ: Walk around any college campus and those famous white earplugs seem to be everywhere. But sometimes the playlist isn't quite what you'd expect. Lectures on Computer Science instead of American Idol. Not so much Sum 41 as History 101. Some teachers have used the audio iPod in their lessons, but at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Professor Jim Foley hopes to transfer his visual Web lectures to the video iPod. PROFESSOR FOLEY, USER INTERFACE DESIGN TEACHER: The students who did Web lectures earned grades that were about 10% better -- we did that three years ago. AZUZ: As MP3 players become essential parts of students' lives, they have the potential to rival the laptop as learning tools in the classroom. With a graduate student's help, Foley records lectures before class, so that students can raise questions when they arrive. Students from Foley's User Interface Design course say they find it valuable to review lectures when convenient. KATHY PHAM, STUDENT IN PROFESSOR FOLEY'S USER INTERFACE DESIGN CLASS: It takes 15 minutes to walk from one side of campus to the other side of campus. And to be able just to download the mp3 to my iPod and just walk across campus, would be very beneficial. SCOTT GILLILAND, STUDENT IN PROFESSOR FOLEY'S USER INTERFACE DESIGN CLASS: A lot of people can't get to a full desktop computer whenever they need to listen to the lectures, and it's nice to be able to take them with you. AZUZ: Although students show enthusiasm towards MP3 players, there are limitations because they're small. FOLEY: The screen resolution is smaller and navigating between pages will be a little bit slower than on the computer because on the computer I just use the mouse. With the iPod I have to use the scrollwheel and scroll around. AZUZ: Like the laptop, the MP3 player is a popular and revolutionary way to gather and disseminate information. Regardless of what teachers decide to use, players and laptops will remain allies. Besides, you need a laptop to operate an iPod and vice versa. (END VIDEO CLIP) Podcast Promo . AZUZ: And if downloading lectures isn't enough, we've got another cool thing you can do with an MP3 player: watch CNN Student News! That's right, you can download our Podcast at CNNstudentnews.com or at iTunes. So you won't miss out on the news when you're on the go. Now and Then . RAMSAY: With cell phones, thin is in. But you had to flex some muscle to handle its oversized ancestor. An iPod can hold your whole music library. But a vintage Walkman let you jam out one cassette at a time. Microchips keep getting smaller and smaller. But old school computers took up a lot more space. And game controllers have buttons for every possible move. But the retro version? One button, one joystick, tons of fun. Learning with Technology . AZUZ: It's not just slimmer cell phones and smaller computers. Advances in technology are changing the world we live in all the time. And one of the places where those changes are taking place is schools. So we talked to some students and experts to hear what they have to say about teaching with tech. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRINA DAVIS, PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION: We started off, when we were first starting to integrate technology, kind of at that basic level. MATTHEW LEWIS, JUNIOR, GREENSIDE HIGH SCHOOL: We of course use laptops and computers. Each teacher is assigned a laptop. And also, we have computer labs and a media center with computers inside. DON KNEZEK, CEO, INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION: Certainly just dropping technology into a learning environment doesn't necessarily improve it unless you are sure that the activities that you are doing align with the expectations that you have for learning. AMMARAH MAHMOUD, JUNIOR, SALEM HIGH SCHOOL: I think many careers today require for people to know how to use technology, so it's important to learn that in school . KNEZEK: So you can't convince me that a student without basic fundamental technology skills is on equal footing for employment. MAHMOUD: I don't think schooling should be technology dependent, because I think that, at the same time, we shouldn't rely on something that doesn't have a mind of its own. KNEZEK: You can certainly abuse technology. You can abuse the printed word. You can abuse access to external resources. Certainly if teachers and school leaders and parents use the same standards that they would use for any resource for technologies, then we're in fine shape. LEWIS: I can see people in the future having something where you just scan, and all of your, you know, personal information comes up and everything about you can come up on a screen, and I think that's really cool. DAVIS: Customization, very innovative, lots of gaming, lots of 3-dimensional spaces and just social spaces that feed on the needs of young learners. (END VIDEO CLIP) Goodbye .

Rescuers and bomb experts search for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building. It was one of two suspected car bombs that struck Algiers within 10 minutes of each other. The death toll is unclear: the official government count is at least 26, but hospital sources in Algiers told CNN affiliate BFM-TV that 76 people were killed in the two blasts. A statement from the United Nations said 45 people were reported killed. Algerian Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni blamed a militant Islamic group with ties to al Qaeda for the attacks, which also targeted a building housing Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court. In a posting on an Islamist Web site, the group al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility. CNN could not immediately corroborate that claim, but the Web site is known to carry messages, claims and videos from al Qaeda and other militant groups. In the posting, the bombers were identified as Sheikh Ibrahim Abu Othman and Abdel Rahman Abu Abdel Nasser al-Asimi. It said two trucks were filled with \"no less than 800 kg (1,763 pounds) of explosives.\" The group called the operation \"another successful conquest and a second epic that the knights of faith have dictated with their blood, defending the wounded Islamic nation and in defiance to the Crusaders and their agents, the slaves of America and the sons of France.\" At least 10 U.N. staffers were among those killed, according to U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe. The offices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees -- located across the street from the U.N. headquarters -- were leveled by a blast that struck about 9:30 a.m. (3:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday. \"Our offices are basically destroyed now, nothing works,\" UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said from its Geneva headquarters. Watch his full interview . He said rescuers are working into the night trying to get to the trapped U.N. workers. \"It's a very serious situation still with the U.N. in Algiers,\" he said. In a strongly worded statement, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned what he called \"an abjectly cowardly strike against civilian officials serving humanity's highest ideals under the U.N. banner.\" \"The perpetrators of these crimes will not escape the strongest possible condemnation -- and ultimate punishment -- by Algerian authorities and the international community,\" Ban said in the written statement. He said he has sent senior advisers and other top U.N. officials to head to Algiers to assist in the investigation and rescue effort. Most of those killed in the coordinated attacks were victims of the first suspected car bombing near the Constitutional Council -- which oversees elections -- and Supreme Court in the Algiers neighborhood of Ben Aknoun, according to the state-run Algeria Press Agency. That blast struck a bus outside the targeted building, killing many of those on board, the news agency reported. One man said he heard the first blast then the second exploded in front of him. \"I saw the trees falling and the glass shattering in front of me. I had to run away from the car,\" he said. Zerhouni said the attack was the work of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), the same group that took responsibility for an attack in April in downtown Algiers that killed 33 people. That group also uses the name al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb after merging with al Qaeda earlier this year. It abandoned small-scale attacks in favor of headline-grabbing blasts after it joined with al Qaeda. CNN International Security Correspondent Paula Newton said the merger combined the expertise of Algerian guerrillas with the operational ability of al Qaeda in North Africa, enabling the group to penetrate the usually extensive security in high-profile areas of Algiers. She said the group's goal is to destabilize countries like Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, which it sees as enemies of the Islamic state. Zerhouni said police interrogations of GSPC members arrested in the wake of the April attack revealed that Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court were on a list of GSPC targets. Algeria, which has a population of 33 million, is still recovering from more than a decade of violence that began after the military government called a halt to elections which an Islamist party was poised to win. Tens of thousands of people died in the unrest. Although the country has remained relatively peaceful, recent terrorist attacks have raised fears of a slide back to violence.

Three Detroit, Michigan, residents and a Cincinnati, Ohio, resident were named in conspiracy and arson counts for a fire at a campus facility that housed federally funded plant genetic research. Officials said the December 31,1999, fire on the East Lansing campus caused more than $1 million in damage to facilities and the loss of research records. They also are accused of setting fire the next day to commercial logging equipment near Mesick, Michigan, in order to sabotage lumbering activity. \"This investigation has been ongoing for almost a decade, and it should be a reminder to all that the FBI does not allow the passage of time to thwart our ability to apply our full resources to a case,\" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Andrew Arena.

Efraim Diveroli, 22, is doing his \"patriotic\" duty as an arms dealer, his grandfather says. What he got instead is a 22-year-old international arms dealer who faces a congressional inquiry for allegedly selling old Chinese ammunition to the U.S. military to equip allies in Afghanistan. Diveroli is president of AEY Inc., a South Florida company which, according to U.S. government documents, has done more than $10 million of business with the U.S. government since 2004. The papers also reveal the company struck it big in 2007 with contracts totaling more than $200 million to supply ammunition, assault rifles and other weapons to the Afghan National Army and police. The company's contract said it would get the ammunition from Hungary. But Army investigators found what the Afghan military got included corroded ammunition made in China as long as 46 years ago. The New York Times reported Thursday that AEY shopped stockpiles and ammo dumps in old Soviet bloc allies, from Albania to Kazakhstan. Albania was a big customer for Chinese armaments in the 1960s and '70s, the Times reported. Angelo Diveroli, Efraim's grandfather, told CNN affiliate WPLG-TV that his grandson is being targeted by \"jealous competitors\" in the international arms market. Since he was a boy, the grandfather said, Efraim Diveroli has known his way around weapons. Read the WPLG story . \"He's a genius about anything to do with weapons,\" the 72-year-old says. \"Ever since he was a little boy, I would take him to gun shows and he could identify every model of guns. People would ask: How can he do that so young? He has a gift, I would tell them.'' Michael Diveroli, Efraim's father, told CNN affiliate WFOR-TV that he wished his son had turned his intellect elsewhere. He said Efraim was \"a boy genius\" who is \"hard to control.\" Read the WFOR story . \"I would prefer he became a nice Jewish doctor or lawyer rather than an arms dealer,\" WFOR quoted Michael Diveroli as saying.  Watch how father says son runs his own show \u00bb .

He lists the weapon-heavy films \"Heat\" and \"Scarface\" among his favorites. A CNN search of Diveroli's Florida criminal record shows arrests, but no convictions, on offenses from misdemeanor battery to felony possession of stolen property. He has yet to appear in court on a March 3 arrest for driving under the influence. For now, relatives say Efraim Diveroli is out of the country. CNN attempts to contact him have not been successful. His grandfather told WPLG that Diveroli is now in Turkey or Albania doing his \"patriotic\" duty. \"He's all over the world getting what the military needs,\" Angelo Diveroli says.

Witnesses say the man arrested Tuesday was \"rocking left and right and up and down.\" Officials said Kevin Brown, a Jamaican national, was acting strangely and caught the attention of an air safety officer at the Florida airport. Brown was arrested on charges of carrying a weapon or explosives onto a plane, according to the FBI. The bureau said Brown, who is in his early 30s, had baggage that concealed two galvanized pipes, end caps, two containers of BBs, batteries, two containers with an unknown liquid, a laptop and bomb-making literature. \"He looked rather crazy,\" a passenger told CNN affiliate WKMG. \"He was rocking left and right and up and down.\" Transportation Safety Administration officials said Brown caught the eye of a \"behavior identification officer\" about noon Tuesday as Brown approached a ticket counter for his planned flight to Jamaica. Lee Kair, the TSA's federal security director in Orlando, said the materials in his bags posed no danger to other travelers. Initial record checks indicate that Brown was in the United States legally, the FBI said. The FBI and the Orlando Police Department are investigating, Kair said. Airport officials say several ticket counters were shut down during the incident and 11 flights were delayed. Airport spokeswoman Carolyn Fennell said Air Jamaica, Air Canada, West Jet and Frontier flights were among those delayed. \"Things are slowly returning to normal,\" Fennell said, adding that the terminal where Brown was apprehended was operating normally by 3 p.m. Kair said that behavior identification officers like the one who spotted Brown are plain-clothes officers trained to watch for suspicious behavior at airports. \"When people are doing things that are deceptive, they exhibit behaviors that are involuntary,\" he said. \"Our officers are very well trained to identify these behaviors.\" Brown is scheduled for an initial appearance in federal court in Orlando on Wednesday.

Singapore Airlines was the first carrier in the world to operate the double-decker aircraft. No-one was injured in the incident involving the world's biggest airliner, a Singapore Airlines spokesman said, but passengers were taken off so the plane could be repositioned and inspected for any damage. A truck being used to push back the plane in preparation for the flight \"experienced some form of failure\" causing it disconnect from the aircraft, a Singapore Airlines spokesman said. \"As a consequence of the failure on the truck, the aircraft ... came into contact with the grass verge off the airport tarmac. The aircraft was not under its own power at the time,\" he said. \"It is too early at this time to know the cause of the incident but Singapore Airlines will investigate this quickly, and is filing reports with the appropriate Singapore authorities,\" the spokesman said. An airline spokesman told CNN's Richard Quest that four wheels had ended up on the grass.  All four tires had now been replaced.  \"As far as Singapore Airlilnes is concerned, the plane is ready to fly again,\" Quest said. The airline made arrangements for as many customers as possible to continue on their journey from Changi Airport to Sydney aboard a Boeing 747-400. Most passengers departed for Sydney on a new flight early Friday morning, while some others flew to alternate destinations such as Melbourne and Brisbane on existing flights. \"The remaining customers, about 10 of them, have left, or will be leaving, for Sydney today,\" the spokesman said. Singapore Airlines received its first A380 in October last year to become the first carrier in the world to operate the double-decker aircraft, which it is currently using for the Singapore-Sydney route. Changi Airport, which is home to the Singapore Airlines A380 fleet, has declared itself ready to handle the plane. It widened and lengthened existing runways and widened runway shoulders to allow the plane to maneuver. Airports around the world have had to make changes to accommodate the A380, such as enlarging runways and gates and bringing in vehicles which can tow the plane and lift high enough to reach its upper decks.

Chinese authorities have blamed followers of the Dalai Lama for instigating the unrest that has swept Tibet. Issuing a statement while traveling in New Delhi, India, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists called on China \"to exercise wisdom and to initiate a meaningful dialogue with the Tibetan people.\" Beijing has blamed the Dalai Lama and his followers for violence that erupted amid protests for Tibetan independence earlier this month, but China has drawn international criticism for its crackdown on the protests that began peacefully. President Bush said Friday he \"urged restraint\" during a phone conversation with Chinese President Hu Jintao earlier this week, and noted \"that it's in his country's interest\" for the government to have representatives \"sit down again with representatives of the Dalai Lama.\" Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, appearing with Bush at the White House, also called for meetings between the two sides. \"It's absolutely clear that there are human rights abuses in Tibet. That's clear-cut. We need to be up-front and absolutely straight about what's going on. Shouldn't shilly-shally about it,\" Rudd said. Tibet's government in exile has said the death toll from the protests has reached about 140 over the past two weeks, but China's government restrictions have made it difficult to confirm that number. Chinese authorities put the death toll at 19 and said most of those killed were \"innocent victims\" -- Han Chinese targeted by Tibetans. \"I am deeply saddened by the loss of life in the recent tragic events. I am aware that some Chinese have also died. I feel for the victims and their families and pray for them,\" the Dalai Lama said in his written statement Friday. He added that there is an \"urgent need to seek a peaceful and mutually beneficial solution through dialogue. Even at this juncture I have expressed my willingness to the Chinese authorities to work together to bring about peace and stability.\" He noted repeatedly that he is not a \"separatist.\" \"Chinese brothers and sisters, I assure you I have no desire to seek Tibet's separation. Nor do I have any wish to drive a wedge between the Tibetan and Chinese peoples,\" he wrote. Instead, protesters seek \"meaningful self-rule\" while remaining a part of China, he added. And, he said, \"despite my repeated support for the Beijing Olympics, the Chinese authorities, with the intention of creating a rift between the Chinese people and myself, the Chinese authorities assert that I am trying to sabotage the games.\" The protests -- which began on the 49th anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising -- have threatened to overshadow Beijing's role as host of the Summer Olympic Games in August. In his statement, the Dalai Lama complained the Chinese state-run media's coverage \"of the recent events in Tibet, using deceit and distorted images, could sow the seeds of racial tension with unpredictable long-term consequences. This is of grave concern to me.\" China's state-run media, however, have accused some Western news agencies -- including CNN -- of distorting coverage of the riots to make China look bad and the protesters look like innocent victims. A headline Friday on the English Web site of China's official Xinhua news agency read \"'Anti-CNN' Web site reflects Chinese people's condemnation.\" The article offered a link to a site in which Chinese bloggers criticize CNN's coverage.

Federal officials estimate there are 1,500 gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park. It means the wolves can be shot and killed once they step out of Yellowstone National Park as soon as the affected states establish a hunting season. However, state Fish and Wildlife officials can shoot the animals whenever they deem the wolves to be a problem. The government delisted the wolves -- which were eliminated from Yellowstone decades ago before being reintroduced in the 1990s -- because they are now thriving in the park that is dominated by bison, elk and bighorn sheep. \"They're back here in the Northern Rockies; they're back here in Yellowstone,\" said Doug Smith, a biologist for the National Park Service in Yellowstone. \"That's something to celebrate given their history of human hatred.\" But not everyone is happy about the animal being removed from the endangered list. Conservationists believe hundreds of gray wolves straying from Yellowstone in search of prey could soon be killed by hunters and ranchers.  Watch rancher say no wolf is \"sacred\" \u00bb . \"We're not ready to pop the champagne corks and have a party,\" said Doug Honnold, the managing attorney for Earthjustice, a non-profit environmental law firm based in Oakland, California, that has threatened to sue the government. \"My biggest fear is we're going to go backwards instead of forwards.\" It wouldn't be the first time. In the early 20th century, wolves were the targets of a massive government extermination campaign. \"It's harder to find an animal more persecuted than wolves. ... We did wolf extermination with a vengeance,\" said Smith. But attitudes began to change in the 1980s. Elk and bison populations increased dramatically because there was no natural predator to keep their numbers in check. In 1995, Smith led a team to bring wolves back to the Rocky Mountain landscape. They transplanted dozens of wolves to Yellowstone from Canada.  See photos of Yellowstone's animals \u00bb . The project has been regarded as an overwhelming success. There are now more than 1,500 wolves across Wyoming, Idaho and Montana, according to the government. That number convinced federal wildlife officials to remove them from the endangered species list. Federal officials require each of the three states to maintain a population of 100 wolves, meaning a total of 300 wolves across all three states. The states have actually pledged to keep the population higher than that, at a rate of 150 wolves per state. \"We did a thorough analysis,\" said Ed Bangs, the wolf recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. \"The consensus [for recovery] is a population of 300 wolves and 30 breeding pairs.\" He added, \"The wolf population is fully recovered. We have more wolves than we ever predicted and we have fewer problems than we ever predicted.\" Earthjustice says that's not nearly enough to ensure a viable population and they want to stop the delisting. \"We're going to have hundreds of wolves die needlessly,\" said Honnold. But many ranchers in the region just don't understand the fuss about the animals. They have complained for years that the wolves eat their livestock. \"There's nothing about a wolf that's sacred,\" said Bruce Malcolm, a cattle rancher and Republican member of Montana's House of Representatives. He said he's lost nearly two dozen cows to the wolves in recent years. \"I would have preferred that they never came here,\" he said. If there's a winner with the controversy, it's Yellowstone. The wolves have pushed up attendance by more than a 100,000 visitors per year, according to a park study. Smith, who has dedicated his life to the wolves, is philosophical about the debate. \"No one says living with wolves is easy,\" said Smith. \"Living with wolves is a compromise.\" E-mail to a friend .", "4df7a53f5e24347a53d5bf3b8c92bef21561f2c4": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The Democratic-led Congress yielded to President Bush on Saturday and approved legislation to temporarily expand government's power to conduct electronic surveillance without a court order in tracking foreign suspects.

Raul Castro was chosen Sunday to take over Cuba's presidency from his brother, Fidel Castro. The state-run newspaper recently ran an article headlined \"Work: Option or necessity?\" The writer pointed out that, judging by the number of people in the streets during the day, many Cubans don't seem to be on the job. They have few motivations to buckle down: Salaries average about $15 per month on the island, and Cubans get monthly food rations even if they don't work.  Watch a report on the realities in Cuba \u00bb . \"There is a strong desire to protect and to gradually increase the incomes and savings of the population, particularly of those least favored,\" said Raul Castro, 76. The black market is so widespread that Cubans have coined a special term for breaking the law to make ends meet: \"resolver\" -- literally, \"to resolve.\"  See Cuba through I-Reporters' eyes \u00bb . The new president, who took the reins of power Sunday from his ailing brother, Fidel, 81, has said the country must become more productive. \"The country's priority will be to meet the basic needs of the population, both material and spiritual, based on the sustained strengthening of the national economy and its productive basis without which, I'll say it again, development would be impossible,\" Raul Castro said in a speech Sunday. Cubans, too, are calling for reforms, though not all of them related to productivity. In a recent video that has made the rounds on the Internet, a student poses tough questions to the president of Cuba's National Assembly, asking why Cubans cannot travel freely to resorts -- a practice derided by critics as \"tourist apartheid.\" Though such a public display of discontent is rare, the video echoed sentiments often voiced in private for years, particularly since the fall of the Soviet empire in 1991 and, with it, the loss of billions of dollars in subsidies. Cuban officials counter that Cubans are not granted access to the nation's most luxurious spots because they do not have the foreign exchange brought by the tourists and needed to run the country's social programs, such as free health care and education. With a new president steering the island nation for the first time in 49 years, some Cubans have allowed their expectations to rise. \"I think those expectations are really very large indeed and it'll be the Achilles heel, potentially, of this new government if it doesn't attack them with some vigor,\" said Hal Klepak, a professor of history and warfare studies at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. Indeed, Castro has promised to move within a few weeks to improve efficiency by cutting some of the red tape that can frustrate the most fervent of revolutionaries. But Wayne S. Smith, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington and chief of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana from 1979 to 1982, predicted Sunday in an editorial in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Raul Castro will not break strongly from his brother's policies. \"Rather, we will see a peaceful transition and the existing system remain largely intact,\" Smith predicted. Still, changes are inevitable, he said. \"Raul Castro has called for a nationwide debate on the country's economic future and for Cubans to propose reforms in group discussions. \"He has also called for new proposals to raise productivity, including discussion of more private ownership of land. The Cuban people want change, want reforms that will bring about a better way of life.\" Smith credited the younger Castro's leadership over the past 1\u00bd years, while serving as acting president, with having already resulted in \"a greater openness, and open criticism of certain government programs.\" But the degree of change remains uncertain, as does the possibility that \"even from the shadow Fidel will try to discourage reforms,\" he said, adding \"the prognosis, nonetheless, is hopeful.\"  See a timeline of Castro's rise to power \u00bb . The U.S. government's former man in Havana recommended current politicians exert pressure on the island with a light touch. \"We could accomplish far more by reducing tensions and beginning a meaningful dialogue,\" he said. \"Raul Castro has several times suggested such a dialogue. Why not take him up on it? We have disagreements, yes, but how do we resolve them without talking?\" E-mail to a friend .

A gold and turquoise necklace, made 4,000 years ago, was found in a burial site near Lake Titicaca. A team found the gold necklace near Lake Titicaca in Peru, according to the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It's 4,000 years old -- 600 years older than any other gold jewelry discovered in the Western Hemisphere. The anthropologist who discovered the gold, Mark Aldenderfer, told CNN on Tuesday night that he sensed the importance of his find after noticing a glint while excavating a site with human remains. \"It appeared to be gold. That's when I knew we had something special,\" he said. \"This was a complete shock.\" He found the necklace about seven years ago, he said, but researchers kept quiet for fear that looters would raid the site. They also wanted to allow time for chemical analysis before announcing their discovery on Tuesday. Video footage from Peru shows a necklace of nine gold tubes separated by 10 stones. The find is important, Aldenderfer said, because it signals the early emergence of a desire for status among people who lived as relative equals without a formal leadership system. The Andean people of that time, Aldenderfer said, had recently settled down after many generations as hunter-gatherers. Formal kings would not emerge for hundreds of years. The person who wore the gold necklace may have sought to distinguish himself with a status symbol, Aldenderfer said. The artifact is in the custody of the National Institute of Peru and may be displayed in a museum, he said.

And you know, more or less, how much you want to spend -- or how much you can afford. You've kicked tires, talked to salesmen, taken a few shiny new numbers for a test-drive and you're ready to make the deal. If you eat in your car you may want to consider fabric or leather protections. Except, you're not quite done. You still need to decide whether to buy any of those \"extras\" that your salesperson will always suggest. Some of these extras have real value and are probably worth adding. Others ... maybe not so much. The list of \"extras\" offered by most dealers, may include paint sealant, fabric protection/leather care, extended warranties, extended 'one price' service contracts, rust/underbody coatings and anti-theft systems, to mention a few. We wanted to know which of these new car extras were worth it and which ones a consumer can do without. To get to the bottom of it, we thought we would consult an expert -- David Bennett, Manager of Automotive Programs for AAA. As it turns out, like most things in life, the answer often just comes down to what's best for you, depending on your own situation, budget or locale. Let's address these add-ons one by one: . Paint sealant . \"I think that most paint jobs on cars are pretty good these days, so in most cases you probably don't need that anymore,\" said Bennett, who offered one caveat. \"But that can depend on what part of the country you live in -- what the climate is, whether you get a lot of snow and ice, and what the road crews put down on the road -- whether it is salt, or if it is something that is less harmful to the paint. But generally, as long as you keep your car washed, and wash that salt off of it, and get it waxed regularly, that paint should last without getting the 'add-on' sealer at the dealership. Also, if you get a chip or a ding, get it fixed so the rust doesn't get a chance to set in and spread.\" Fabric / leather protection . These extras are fairly self-explanatory -- the dealer \"treats\" the upholstered or leather seating with a \"protection\" product that make the seats more resistant to stains or scuff marks. \"This can be a good purchase, but the first question you should ask before buying it is, 'What kind of lifestyle do I lead?' suggests Bennett. \"Do you have a lot of kids and are they prone to spill things? Or is your vehicle mostly going to be occupied by adults?\" Do you eat in the car with some regularity? If so, and you're just too darn messy for your own good, a stain protection might be a good way to go. \"Also, look at exclusions in the plan,\" advises Bennett. \"If you're a smoker, and the plan excludes burn holes from cigarette ashes, and you're not diligent about making sure your ash is always short, that might not be a good purchase because of that exclusion. Each of these policies or plans is probably offering something different, and you need to read all of the exclusions before making that purchase, because it might not be a good one for you.\" If you want to save some cash, one option would be to forego the protectant and just make sure you clean your seats regularly with a good upholstery cleaner or leather cleaner. To remove spots from a leather seat, use a good leather cleaner and work it into the spot with a soft cloth. If the spot still remains, let it sit for a few hours. Repeat, as they say, if necessary. It's also a good idea , to use a leather conditioner regularly on leather seats to restore moisture and to maintain its appearance. Rustproofing . This is when the dealership applies various rust-inhibiting chemicals, waxes or sealers to the vehicle's undercarriage. It can also be applied to other rust-prone areas. Rustproofing treatments sometimes include a guarantee over a certain number of years. Keep in mind that some guarantees require annual \"checkups\" to re-apply the sealers or rust inhibitors to any areas where the rustproofing may have been damaged. \"I don't think this is necessary in most cases,\" opines Bennett. \"The way most vehicles are constructed today, they are not nearly as prone to underbody rusting as they used to be in the old days -- even in the north, where they get a lot of snow.\" LoJack Car Security System / Anti-theft systems: . The folks at LoJack Car Security Systems report that a vehicle is stolen every 25 seconds in the U.S. Using a car alarm is one way to protect your vehicle. But if you want to go the more high-tech \"tracking\" route, using a security system like LoJack may give you more peace of mind. The LoJack System, includes a small radio frequency transceiver hidden in up to 20 different places in the vehicle. The System uses a code that is tied into the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). Then, when you report that your car has been stolen, the state police crime computer can match code against the state VIN database. This automatically activates the LoJack System in the vehicle -- emitting an inaudible signal. Then, police cruisers and aviation units that have the LoJack tracking system can identify the vehicle's location, track it and recover it. LoJack claims that over 200,000 vehicles have been recovered worldwide using their system, with over 100,000 of those in the U.S. \"Whether or not this is a purchase you should make depends on various factors. If you live in a high-crime area, a system like this could provide you with peace of mind,\" advises Bennett. \"But even if you live in a safe, low-crime district, your car can still be stolen from a busy downtown street or parking garage,\" he notes. One caveat: Some car owners may not want their car back after it has been stolen, especially if it has been seriously vandalized, or if it has been driven so hard that it causes some mechanical problems. Another thing to consider is that owners of GM vehicles that come with its patented OnStar system, probably won't need a theft tracking program, says Bennett. \"Because the system allows OnStar operators to track the location of the vehicle if it is stolen. So if you buy a GM car with the OnStar system, you may want to pass on a LoJack or similar tracking system.\" Extended warranties . \"This really does depend on how long you plan to keep the vehicle, because most of these extended warranty plans don't kick in until the manufacturer's warranty expires,\" advises Bennett. \"And these days, those manufacturers warranties are three or five years, sometimes longer. \"So if you plan on selling the car after three or five years, it probably doesn't make sense to buy the extended warranty.\" Some warranties offer transferable policies, which let you \"sell\" the warranty along with the vehicle. Others allow you to \"return\" the warranty for a pro-rated refund. Bennett also explains that not all warranties are created equal. \"They usually have three levels of warranties: A basic extended warranty will just cover the powertrain, for example; while a better one will cover the powertrain plus some other components that are listed -- or an 'exclusionary' extended warranty may say it covers everything except those items that are listed. At the top end, the best warranty just covers everything, but that is also the most expensive.\" Bennett gives an example of one manufacturers warranty. \"For a 2007 Buick, the basic manufacturers warranty is five years or 100,000 miles for the powertrain coverage, and the corrosion warranty is six years or 100,000 miles. In fact, that's the same warranty GM offers on their Chevy and Cadillac brands.\" \"That's a pretty good warranty, so if you plan on only keeping your vehicle for five years or less, the extended warranty is probably money you don't need to spend.\" E-mail to a friend .", "6c498fd6de7ad5e5006732655050c1d97cc2af68": "CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee (CNN) -- When meeting Jeff Donohoo, it's not immediately apparent he is a 36-year-old man living with autism. In fact, unless you get him talking about the Atlanta Braves -- one of his true passions in life -- he is a very quiet person. Jeff Donohoo, 36, at work in the kitchen at Memorial Hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Early on, his younger brothers and sister didn't know, either. \"Since they grew up with him, they just knew Jeff was Jeff,\" said Nancy Donohoo, his mother. \"They didn't think of him as weird or anything.\" But when friends started to notice Donohoo was different, Nancy Donohoo was quick to explain to a group of 10-year-olds why. \"Jeff has a social problem, not a mental problem,\" she explained. \"He's very smart. He reads encyclopedias ... he just doesn't know how to talk to people.\" From then on, friends who visited the house always made an effort to interact with Donohoo, through a high-five or a simple \"hello.\" Today, it's unlikely Donohoo will be the first to say hello in a group setting, but interacting with people is easier for him than it once was.  See how Donohoo copes every day \u00bb . Questioned about his childhood, his most elaborate response is \"yeah\" or \"no.\" But when the topic is the Braves, it's hard to get him to stop talking about the latest statistics or his favorite player, Mark Teixeira. Asked how long he's been a Braves fan, there was little hesitation: \"All my life.\" He's come a long way since he was a child. Then, just teaching Donohoo to talk was a challenge in itself, Nancy Donohoo said. \"There was no eye contact, so I would hold his face in front of me, and say the word I wanted him to say.\" Donohoo entered the first grade as a special education student. It was the first year special education was offered in his family's hometown of Florence, Alabama. He carried on with special education until the sixth grade, when he was mainstreamed, or put in classes with children without disabilities.  Explainer: Understanding autism \u00bb . For most of Donohoo's childhood, his mother had suspicions about his condition. \"When he was little, I had watched a 'Marcus Welby' show, and they had an autistic child on there. But he was very passive; he sat in the corner and just hit things,\" Nancy Donohoo said. \"Jeff was wild. He was the opposite, so I just assumed he couldn't be autistic. But he had a lot of those mannerisms.\" It was Donohoo's freshman year of high school when Nancy and Bill Donohoo learned what was wrong with their son. \"There was a doctor in Huntsville that dealt a lot with hyperactive children,\" Nancy Donohoo said. \"He said, 'I'm going to give you this sheet of paper; these are all the symptoms of autism.' \" The list had 19 symptoms, and Nancy Donohoo was instructed to circle the ones her son had. She circled 17. The diagnosis didn't change how Nancy Donohoo dealt with her first-born son. In fact, the doctor said she already was doing all the right things, working to socialize Donohoo. Today, Donohoo, living with his parents, finds comfort in strict routine. He wakes each day at 5 a.m. to make himself breakfast and prepare for work. At 6, Nancy Donohoo drives her son to Memorial Hospital, where he's entering his 16th year of service with the cafeteria. Ollie Fort\u00e9 is Donohoo's supervisor, and has worked with Donohoo almost since the beginning. \"He's very valuable to us at this department. He's dependable, on time, no attendance problems,\" said Fort\u00e9. \"We love Jeff.\" After work, at 2:30 p.m., Donohoo rides with his mother to the YMCA, where he works out for about three hours. Then it's back home, where he fixes himself dinner and spends hours online looking up Braves statistics, or reading a number of baseball-related books from his personal library. This cycle repeats on days Donohoo works at the hospital. On his days off, the schedule is equally strict, with little variation. He'll still go to the YMCA, and he'll also make the occasional trip to the bookstore, adding to his collection of baseball-related literature. Sudden changes to daily plans are still a challenge. \"If he's made his plans to do something tonight,\" said Bill Donohoo, \"and we come and say, 'We're going to get something to eat. Do you want to go?' that upsets his plans for what he's going to do that night.\" Physical contact is also difficult. \"He doesn't like to be touched,\" Nancy Donohoo said. \"He doesn't freak, but he doesn't like it. He stiffens up. He'll want to give you a hug, but he still has a hard time.\" The many challenges aside, Donohoo has a fine appreciation for things like cooking. In addition to preparing his own meals, he also enjoys baking. \"He loves desserts -- he loves sweets,\" Nancy Donohoo said with a laugh. \"He's a little heavy, but we're working on that.\" Nancy and Bill Donohoo have endured the challenges, and they acknowledge their son will never be fully independent. But one can tell they couldn't be prouder of him. \"It's rewarding today, because he's come so far, but it was a long road,\" Nancy Donohoo said.

The son of the most-wanted man in the world spoke Sunday to CNN in a quiet, middle-class suburb about an hour outside Cairo, Egypt. Omar bin Laden, who works as a contractor, said he is talking publicly because he wants an end to the violence his father has inspired -- violence that has killed innocent civilians in a spate of attacks around the world, including those of September 11, 2001. \"I try and say to my father: 'Try to find another way to help or find your goal. This bomb, this weapons, it's not good to use it for anybody,' \" he said in English learned in recent months from his British wife. He said that's not just his own message, but one that a friend of his father's and other Muslims have expressed to him. \"They too say ... my father should change [his] way,\" he said.  Watch whether Omar bin Laden thinks his father will ever be caught \u00bb . He said he hasn't spoken to his father since 2000, when he walked away from an al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan with his father's blessings. He said he has no idea where his father is, but is confident he will never be caught because locals support him. Asked if his father might be living along the Afghan-Pakistan border, he said, \"Maybe, maybe not.\" \"Either way, the people there are different,\" he said. \"They don't care about the government.\" Now, he and his wife are preparing to launch a movement far different from the one his father, Osama bin Laden, launched. They are pursuing a movement for peace. At first glance, Omar bin Laden appears to have little in common with the man who has eluded international efforts to find him. The 26-year-old's hair is bound in neat braids, he drives a Jeep and is married to a British national twice his age. But the physical resemblance quickly sinks in, even without the long beard his father favors. It is a resemblance he doesn't avoid. \"Being Osama's son, I don't hide it. I don't hide my name,\" he said. \"I am proud by my name, but if you have a name like mine you will find people run away from you, are afraid of you.\" He said he doesn't consider his father to be a terrorist. When his father was fighting the Soviets, Washington considered him a hero, he said. \"Before they call it war; now they call it terrorism,\" he said. He said his father believes his duty is to protect Muslims from attack. \"He believes this is his job -- to help the people,\" he said. \"I don't think my father is a terrorist because history tells you he's not.\" However, Omar bin Laden -- who was 14 when he began training in al Qaeda camps -- said he differs greatly with his father over the killing of civilians. Was 9/11 a just attack? \"I don't think 9/11 was right personally, but it happened,\" he said. \"I don't think ... [the war] in Vietnam was right. I don't think what's going on in Palestine is right. I don't think what's going on in Iraq is right. \"If we make what is right and not right, we will make a very big list,\" he said. He said he left al Qaeda because he did not want to be associated with killing civilians. He said his father did not try to dissuade him from leaving al Qaeda. \"I told him I was going, and wanted to try life and see what it was like outside because, from a young age I was with my father, and I only saw and heard my father and his friends. My father told me, 'If this is what your choice -- your decision -- is, what can I tell you? I like you to be with me, but this is your decision.' \" So father and son went their separate ways. But there has been no running from the bin Laden name, not after the events of September 11. On that day, Omar bin Laden was in Saudi Arabia, where 15 of the 19 hijackers were from. Asked if, upon learning of the news, he knew his father had been behind it, he replied, \"Yeah, maybe.\" He said he felt sadness for those killed. \"I don't think 9/11 was right personally,\" he said. \"I don't agree with 9/11 or with any war where only civilians are dying.\" Asked why he did not protest more strongly his father's role in the killing of civilians, he said it is up to the religious clerics close to his father to tell Osama bin Laden to change tactics in the name of Islam. And even if that most unlikely scenario were to occur, he said, al Qaeda would not stop. \"My father doesn't have the power to stop the movement at this moment.\" Sitting by his side throughout the hour-and-a-half interview was his wife, Zaina. The two are organizing a multi-month horserace through North Africa in the name of peace, set to kick off this year. But getting sponsors to line up behind the name bin Laden has been difficult. \"It would probably have been easier to do a race without having Omar's name, but then the race would just be a race, it wouldn't be a race for peace,\" his wife said. Omar bin Laden said his relationship with his father was limited. He is the fourth of 11 children born to his father's first wife, and he is one of 19 children Osama bin Laden has fathered. \"Most of the time he busy, so busy, all the day he's busy [with] his friends. He was working a lot.\" Omar bin Laden is now undertaking perhaps an impossible task: trying to rebrand the name they share. But he said he is not looking for approval from his father. \"My life, I take care of my life,\" he said. \"My father he take care of his life.\" E-mail to a friend .", "fc8f0e54e2627ebe705735f0565d77ca64579d92": "BEIJING, China (Reuters) -- A Chinese couple tried to name their baby \"@,\" claiming the character used in e-mail addresses echoed their love for the child, an official trying to whip the national language into line said on Thursday. The unusual name stands out especially in Chinese, which has no alphabet and instead uses tens of thousands of multi-stroke characters to represent words. \"The whole world uses it to write e-mail, and translated into Chinese it means 'love him',\" the father explained, according to the deputy chief of the State Language Commission Li Yuming. While the \"@\" symbol is familiar to Chinese e-mail users, they often use the English word \"at\" to sound it out -- which with a drawn out \"T\" sounds something like \"ai ta,\" or \"love him,\" to Mandarin speakers. Li told a news conference on the state of the language that the name was an extreme example of people's increasingly adventurous approach to Chinese, as commercialisation and the Internet break down conventions. Another couple tried to give their child a name that rendered into English sounds like \"King Osrina.\" Li did not say if officials accepted the \"@\" name. But earlier this year the government announced a ban on names using Arabic numerals, foreign languages and symbols that do not belong to Chinese minority languages. Sixty million Chinese faced the problem that their names use ancient characters so obscure that computers cannot recognize them and even fluent speakers were left scratching their heads, said Li, according to a transcript of the briefing on the government Web site (www.gov.cn).

If you live in a major metropolitan area on either coast, chances are you do. If you live in the Midwest or northwest, odds are that you don't. Miami ranks as the worst city for most aggressive drivers for the second straight year in a nationwide study of driver habits followed by New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Washington. But if road rage is a \"cultural phenomenon\" as one of our experts suggests, how best do we go about combating driver frustration across the nation? Traffic black spots . The nation's roads are peppered with traffic black spots, junctions where car snarls elicit road rage in even the most mild-mannered drivers. Southern California has the San Diego (I-405) Freeway, and the nation's busiest junction, where U.S. 101 meets it to the north of Los Angeles. Miami and the East Coast have I-95, which snakes from the world's busiest cruise port up to Maine. The District of Columbia and the Beltway are infamous for gridlock. I've spent three very nervous hours getting to Chicago's O'Hare Airport from the city center (before missing my flight). Traffic by definition is worst in major metropolitan areas -- if your farming community is gridlocked, you'd better be grousing at your local council meetings -- but it is the increase in traffic that leads many to suggest it's just going to get worse. Traffic levels are rising seemingly as fast as home foreclosures in Los Angeles and Miami. In these areas, it's not only the rise in number of drivers, but the rising age of drivers. AAA points out that seniors are the fastest growing demographic in the U.S. That suggests drivers should adjust their habits accordingly. AAA has launched its Lifelong Safe Mobility campaign to help seniors adjust to more crowded roads and perhaps more aggressive drivers. The facts and remedy . When the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety studied more than 10,000 incidents of road rage and violent aggressive driving committed in the 1990s, it found that at least 218 people were killed and another 12,610 injured when drivers got angry. Many of these aggressors are males aged 18 to 26. The AAA Web site offers a three-step plan to avoid becoming the victim of aggressive driving: . \u2022 The first tip is \"don't offend,\" which includes cutting off other drivers, driving slowly in the left lane, tailgating and gesturing to other drivers. \u2022 The agency then warns to \"not engage,\" which advises steering clear of trouble, not making eye contact and getting help, by calling 911, in the event of experiencing dangerous, aggressive driving. It then asks at-risk drivers to \"adjust their attitude,\" which involves \"forgetting winning\" (for the drivers to whom driving is a Darwinian survival of the fittest), or putting themselves in the other drivers' shoes. \u2022 Finally, they recommend that, if you think you have a road rage problem, seek professional help. Other people's actions . So the wife and I were looking for sofas. It was a Sunday morning and, with me behind the wheel, we were dawdling around quiet streets trying to find one of those seemingly ubiquitous furniture warehouses. Soon, the wife pointed one out but we were almost past it. I hit the brakes and quickly pulled in, then realized that a Mercedes M-Class had pulled in right behind me. A large, squat tattooed guy jumped out and started shouting, about 10 feet from my car. \"I have children in the car, I had to slam on the brakes, [how dare] you brake so quickly,\" he said, getting real mean. I appreciated I'd probably braked quickly and that it was bad driving on my part. However, as his tirade continued, I very calmly asked why he was setting such a bad example for his young children by following another driver off the road, then shouting and swearing. The man continued his harangue before climbing back into his vehicle and driving away. The next time you're fulminating in your front seat about another's aggressive driving, remember that your driving will almost inevitably elicit the same response in someone else. And don't swear in front of your kids or set a bad example for them. 'Cultural phenomenon' Dr. Leon James is a professor of psychology at the University of Hawaii and Web master of DrDriving.org. He is also the co-author of \"Road Rage and Aggressive Driving\" with this wife, Diane Nahl. James began studying driving psychology about 20 years ago after his wife told him her mother thought he took turns too fast. Over a period of self-study, he said he was amazed by the mistakes he made and the aggressive thoughts he experienced toward other drivers. He recorded them via his \"Speakaloud\" method. Using his method on students, he discovered that road rage is a \"cultural phenomenon.\" \"We call the back seat of the car the 'road rage nursery', where [young children] pick up all the driver's bad habits,\" James said. \"It's a cultural temper tantrum.\" James said \"local norms\" can play a part. For example, Florida drivers yell at each other more than in California, where verbal interplay can be interpreted as road rage in a criminal court. But, in the main, it's \"drivers trying to deal with their emotions in stressful situations.\" James said that, in his studies, an awareness gap exists in aggressive drivers: When asked about drivers' habits, respondents suggested that about 85 percent of other drivers drove aggressively, while just 35 percent said they themselves drove aggressively. If you feel your blood boiling frequently behind the wheel, classes like James' are sprouting all over the nation. Addressing road rage . In an ideal world, an increase in drivers would automatically be met by an improvement in infrastructure, and fewer road-rage-inducing distractions. Another Utopian ideal is for everyone else to drive more considerately. One look at our nation's crumbling roads tells us that this fantasyland clearly doesn't exist. Instead of looking outside your car at road conditions or the habits of other drivers, the answer to aggressive driving, most likely, lies within the confines of your own cabin.

I'm just sorry,\" she said. \"I got nothing else to say. I'm just sorry for the loss of that family.\" Police announced Saturday that they had arrested Lockhart, 23, of Smiths, Alabama, in connection with the shooting death of Lauren Burk, 18, of Marietta, Georgia.  Watch the mother cry and apologize \u00bb . Lockhart faces charges of capital murder during a kidnapping, capital murder during a robbery and capital murder during an attempted rape, police said. Also, Lockhart is facing robbery charges in the Phenix City, Alabama, area, said William Clanton of the Phenix City Police Department. Clanton did not know how many robberies Lockhart was suspected of committing. Lockhart is being held in the Russell County jail, but is expected to be moved to Lee County soon, where Auburn University is, Clanton said. Burk was found shot Tuesday night on North College Street, a few miles north of campus. She died later at a hospital. Minutes after police responded to a call reporting an injured person and found Burk, they received a report of a car -- which turned out to be Burk's -- on fire in a campus parking lot. Authorities believe gasoline or another accelerant was used to ignite Burk's car, Auburn Assistant Police Chief Tommy Dawson said Friday. Police were investigating whether a gas can found in downtown Auburn was related to the case. Memorial services for Burk were held Saturday and Sunday at a Marietta church and synagogue. A campus-wide memorial service will be held Monday. A memorial service was held Sunday in Athens, Georgia, for another slain university student Eve Carson, the Athens Banner Herald reported. Carson, 22, the student body president for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was found shot to death in a suburban neighborhood not far from campus about 5 a.m. Wednesday. Her car was found Thursday, in another neighborhood to the west, about a block or two from where she lived with roommates. On Saturday, police released two surveillance photographs of a \"person of interest\" taken by an ATM camera in the Chapel Hill area, Chapel Hill Police Chief Brian Curran said. The person appeared to be using one of Carson's ATM cards and was driving a vehicle that was possibly hers. Curran called the photographs the \"biggest break\" in the case, which he said still appears to be random. Reminders of the popular student president appeared on the jerseys of the university's men's basketball team Saturday night as they took on Duke University's Blue Devils in Durham, North Carolina. The top-ranked Tar Heels wore jersey patches that read \"Eve.\" Many of Duke's fans donned small light-blue ribbons as a show of support. There was a moment of silence for Carson before tip-off. The ribbons and moment of silence say \"a heckuva lot about Duke University,\" UNC Coach Roy Williams told reporters after the game. The Tar Heels won 76-68.

An above-ground kitchen used by the doomsday cult in the Penza region during the summer. The former cave-dweller, Vitaly Nedogon, relayed his claims to Russian TV journalists, according to Anton Sharonov, a spokesman for the administration of Penza, a region southeast of Moscow. The official said Nedogon did not report the information to police or authorities. Once the rest of the apocalyptic sect leaves the cave, investigators will move in to try to confirm Nedogon's report, Sharonov said. Nedogon and others left the cave, said to be near the village of Nikolskoye, about 700 kilometers (435 miles) from the Russian capital, about a week ago, after part of its ceiling collapsed. He claimed two women died at different times during the cult's seclusion, which began in November 2007. One woman died of cancer and the other from excessive fasting, he told the media. \"However,\" Sharonov told the Russian news agency Interfax, \"the Penza regional administration is of the view that these deaths must be proven legally, which is possible only if all the people leave the cave so that investigative officials can examine it.\" Sharonov said those who remain in the cave told Penza officials during negotiations that they would come out by the Russian Orthodox Easter, on April 27. He said officials believe 11 people are left in the cave, but only nine will be alive if Nedogon's report is true. According to Interfax, Penza Deputy Governor Oleg Melnichenko, who is leading the local effort to resolve the situation, said he was unaware of any deaths in the cave. The cave ordeal began when Kuznetsov, the group's leader, told his followers to hide themselves to await the end of the world, which he predicted would take place in May. They had threatened to commit mass suicide if authorities tried to intervene. Thirty-five sect members are believed to have entered the cave initially, Interfax said. E-mail to a friend .

Richard Sonnen spent 16 months in mental health institutions after plotting to kill his high school classmates. It would be a fitting payback to his high school classmates who Richard said relentlessly bullied him. \"I always wanted to get back at them,\" Richard Sonnen said of his classmates. \"I always wanted to strangle them. ... I was always mad. I was always angry and I would come home and cry to mom and dad.\" Both Richard and Elaine Sonnen spoke to CNN at the 45-acre family farm. Unlike  Columbine and recent school shootings at Northern Illinois University and Virginia Tech, Elaine Sonnen did see the warning signs in her son and was able to stop him. Elaine and her husband, Tom, adopted Richard from a Bulgarian orphanage when he was just 4\u00bd years old. \"I mean, we just loved him, and he was just a big sparkle of life,\" she said. But only a few months after they brought him home, they began to see another side of their son. He was angry and unpredictable. Elaine Sonnen says that at age 6, Richard told her he wanted to kill her. She said he would shake with anger to the point that he'd scream at her, telling her he wanted to destroy her. \"People thought he was just the greatest kid in the world. Very polite, well-mannered, caring,\" Elaine Sonnen remembered. \"At home, he could be anywhere from just a really helpful kid to a monster. A terrifying monster.\"  Mother says son had 'two' personalities \u00bb . In junior high, he said, \"evil\" classmates started picking on him. Boys and girls, he said, bullied him until he couldn't take it anymore. \"I always wanted to get revenge,\" he said. By the eighth grade, Richard was put on anti-psychotic medications. He had been diagnosed as bipolar and was suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and other disorders. In 1999, when the Columbine shootings happened, the Sonnens feared that Richard might do the same thing one day. \"We stopped and looked at each other and said, 'This could be Richard; some day this could be him,' \" Elaine Sonnen said. Years later, during his junior year in high school, they were right. Fed up with the bullies, Richard says, he felt like an outcast and started looking for a way to get even. Secretly, he began reading books about Columbine in his school library. The shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, became his heroes. \"They planned it out so perfectly and so meticulously ... that I just, wow, you know,\" he said. \"They're my gods.\"  Watch a preview of \"Campus Rage\" \u00bb . He even created a hit list of the classmates he planned to kill at Prairie High School in Cottonwood, Idaho. \"My plan was to set around bombs around the school. ... I analyzed a lot of where everybody sat and where everybody did their thing,\" he said. \"I had pinpoints of where I wanted to go, where I wanted to do it.\" Harvard Medical School psychologist William Pollack, who consulted on a 2002 federal government study of school shootings, said it found that most school shooters often had feelings of anger, sadness and isolation as well as homicidal and suicidal thoughts. \"We see a young man who obviously is telling us how depressed he was, how angry he was and how much he looked up to people who we know are very disturbed and very dangerous, and how close he came to killing people,\" said Pollack, who watched CNN's interview with Richard. Elaine Sonnen found out about her son's plan during a conversation with him. She ordered him to write down the names of the eight students he wanted dead and then gave the list to his caseworker the next day. Later, he added a teacher and his mother and sister to the hit list. She took immediate action and had her son committed to an Idaho mental institution. Over the next 16 months, he received treatment at several mental health facilities throughout Idaho. \"There, I opened up. I felt better. I moved on with myself,\" Richard said. \"They felt at that point ... they had done everything they could do for him,\" Elaine Sonnen added. \"He was doing great. He could make it on his own. They had no question.\" In January 2007, after almost a year and a half in mental institutions, Richard Sonnen started a new life at Lewis-Clark State College in Lewiston, Idaho. He was taking a cocktail of three anti-psychotic drugs to help him function. \"[For] the first time in 12 years, I was able to hold my son,\" said Elaine Sonnen. \"So I knew he was on the road to be well.\" Everything seemed to be looking up, but in April 2007, three days after the Virginia Tech massacre, Richard's mother received a call from police. They told her Richard had made about four threats to carry out shootings at Lewis Clark State College and Lewiston High School. Police told her Richard planned to go home, get some guns and go back to school to pull off a sniper attack from a clock tower on the college's campus, she said. Police took him into protective custody and searched his apartment for clues. But, in the end, he was released because, authorities say, they didn't have enough evidence to charge him with a crime. Richard said the whole incident was a big misunderstanding. He said he was telling people about his high school plot and never threatened his college or local high school. But his mother doesn't believe his version of the story. \"No. I believe he made those threats,\" she said. \"I still believe it.\" Richard, now 19, signed an order banning him from campus for one year. Today, he lives on his own in Washington state. He's still on medication but not seeing a psychiatrist. Since he's over the age of 18, his mom can't force him to go. Is Elaine Sonnen still afraid of her son? \"Yeah, at times, I'm very afraid,\" she said. \"Because he still has a lot of anger towards me.\" She said the signs are still there, and she fears what could happen if he ever stops taking his medicine. \"He's not getting the help and the insight from a professional that could see the signs,\" she said. \"Because as a person with a mental illness, you have skewed thinking.\" Even though Richard calls her the \"greatest person in the world,\" Elaine Sonnen protects the family by keeping an alarm on her son's bedroom door when he comes home to visit. So why are Richard Sonnen and his mother, Elaine, speaking out now? In the wake of the Northern Illinois University and Virginia Tech shootings, Richard wants young people experiencing the same symptoms he had to seek out help. His mother wants parents and authorities to listen for warning signs and to act fast and decisively.

Two Shiite militiamen take up combat positions during recent clashes with Iraq security forces. Refugees International underscored that development in a report issued Tuesday titled \"Uprooted and Unstable: Meeting Urgent Humanitarian Needs in Iraq.\" The report says the United States, the government of Iraq and the international community aren't doing enough to address the daily problems faced by the 2.7 million internally displaced Iraqis, who have fled homes in war-torn regions to other places in Iraq. Those people find themselves unemployed in their new locations and many times unable to access food and health care. \"As a result of the vacuum created by the failure of both the Iraqi government and the international community to act in a timely and adequate manner, non-state actors play a major role in providing assistance to vulnerable Iraqis,\" the report says. Social services are being provided by \"militias of all denominations\" that want to build their groups, with Muqtada al-Sadr's political movement using a Hezbollah model to set itself up \"as the main service provider in the country.\" Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant group labeled a terrorist group by the United States, has built a large base of support with its social service network. \"Similarly, other Shiite and Sunni groups are gaining ground and support through the delivery of food, oil, electricity, clothes and money to the civilians living in their fiefdoms. \"Not only do these militias now have a quasi-monopoly in the large-scale provision of assistance in Iraq, they are also recruiting an increasing number of civilians to their militias -- including displaced Iraqis,\" the report said. The report says al-Sadr's militia, the Mehdi Army, has resettled displaced Iraqis \"free of charge in homes that belonged to Sunnis.\" \"It provides stipends, food, heating oil, cooking oil and other non-food items to supplement the Public Distribution System rations which are still virtually impossible to transfer after displaced Iraqis have moved to a new neighborhood, though it is easier for Shiites to do so,\" the report says. Refugees International visited a Sadrist office in Baghdad's Ur district and observed residents providing \"clothing, milk, oil, rice, sugar, clothes and fuel for heating and cooking when supplies are available.\" The Sadrists also adjudicate legal disputes among citizens and give stipends to families of displaced people and slain or jailed Mehdi Army fighters. The report says Sunni militias also play a similar role in helping needy and displaced Sunnis, though there is less organized help. \"Sunni militias also handle the distribution of key items such as heating gas. As Sunnis in Baghdad get virtually no electricity or other services from the government, they rely on local militias and warlords to secure their areas and manage what services they can obtain.\" The displaced have joined \"awakening\" groups -- the \"U.S.-backed militias\" dominated by Sunnis. Those groups provide security duties, such as guarding checkpoints, and many of them have been getting paychecks from the United States. The U.N. refugee agency says the displacement crisis caused by the war in Iraq is the most significant in the Middle East since the population changes that occurred during the 1948 creation of Israel. Along with the 2.7 million internally displaced people, there are more than 2 million Iraqi refugees -- mostly in Syria and Jordan. The report slams the government of Iraq as being \"unwilling\" and \"unable\" to address such humanitarian issues -- \"lacking both the capacity and the political will to use its important resources to address humanitarian needs.\" \"The little assistance provided by the government is perceived by most as being biased in favor of the Shiite population, especially when it comes to the delivery of government services such as electricity or food ration cards from the Public Distribution System,\" the report says. The report adds that the \"international community has largely been in denial\" about the dire humanitarian situation in Iraq. \"Only recently has the United Nations issued a common humanitarian appeal for Iraq, recognizing the nature of the situation and the need for all agencies to step up and address humanitarian needs.\" E-mail to a friend .", "a3cb529364dbdcd2af9e30ecfe56898be375870b": "(CNN) -- Presidential candidates have been wooing voters in Iowa for months, but who wins Thursday may simply come down to where the caucus-goers live, where they meet and the weather. Iowa is a mixed bag politically, and one of the most evenly divided states in the nation. But the candidates will likely watch two regions more closely than others. The central part of the state -- including industrial Des Moines -- is Iowa's most Democratic area. Western Iowa, on the other hand, is home to the most Republicans -- especially the rural counties in the northwest. The Mississippi River city of Davenport is expected to be one of the most significant battlegrounds, with Linn County -- dominated by the university town of Cedar Rapids -- also attracting lots of attention from both parties. Past Iowa caucuses have been nail-biters for the candidates. Democrat Al Gore won the state by a margin of just 0.3 percent in 2000, while President Bush carried it in 2004 by 0.7 percent. In fact, Bush was the first GOP presidential candidate to carry Iowa in 20 years. Important endorsement . The support of Iowa's largest newspaper, the Des Moines Register, may also play a role in Thursday's caucuses. The paper's presidential endorsements began in 1988 and have become a highly sought-after prize in Iowa presidential politics. George W. Bush was the Register's pick in 2000 and went on to win Iowa, the GOP nomination and the White House. Republican presidential hopeful Bob Dole won the state in 1996 and 1988 after receiving the paper's support. Democratic candidates haven't had as much success with the Register's endorsement. John Edwards finished in second place in Iowa in 2004, while Paul Simon was also a close second in 1988. The paper endorsed Sen. John McCain and Sen. Hillary Clinton for their respective parties' nominations. The candidates have to appeal to voters with strong opinions. On the Republican side, 37 percent of participants in the 2000 Iowa GOP caucuses identified themselves as members of the religious right and 73 percent described themselves as conservatives. Meanwhile, 56 percent of the participants in Iowa's 2004 Democratic caucuses described themselves as either very or somewhat liberal. About 37 percent said they were moderates. The weather . Iowans who take part in the caucuses must traditionally brave freezing temperatures and lots of snow. Presidential candidates know bad weather may affect how many people turn out, but 1972 was the only time rough winter conditions played a role in the caucuses, according to Drake University's Hugh Winebrenner -- the nation's leading expert on Iowa caucus history. Caucus-goers that year encountered heavy snowdrifts from a blizzard the previous day. Temperatures dipped below zero across most of the state. The weather forced about one-fourth of Iowa's 99 counties to postpone their Democratic caucuses up to two days after the scheduled date. The forecast for Thursday is much better. Temperatures will be in the 20s during the day and dip just below that as the caucuses begin, according to the Des Moines Register.

McCartney's lawyer Fiona Shackleton, left, pictured after it is alleged Mills threw water over her. Mills represented herself during the proceedings and was a \"less than impressive witness\" on her own behalf, Judge Hugh Bennett wrote in awarding her \u00a324.3 million ($48.6 million) -- far less than the \u00a3125 million she had sought from McCartney in the dissolution of their four-year marriage. \"Having given in her favor every allowance for the enormous strain she must have been under and in conducting her own case, I am driven to the conclusion that much of her evidence, both written and oral, was not just inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid,\" Bennett wrote. Mills emerged from the court Monday angry about the judge's treatment of her. She said the judge and attorneys acted like they were part of a \"club.\" Blog: Did Mills pour water on McCartney's lawyer? A summary of Bennett's decision was released Monday, but Mills had sought to keep the full ruling under wraps. Britain's Court of Appeals ruled against her Tuesday, and her lawyer, David Rosen, said she accepted the decision.  See a list of expensive celebrity divorces \u00bb . \"She as a mother has strived to protect her child and felt there were certain issues and matters in the judgment which affected that,\" Rosen said. Mills opposed the full ruling's publication because it contained private details about her and her 4-year-old daughter with McCartney, Beatrice.  Watch Mills react to Monday's decision \u00bb . Bennett had good things to say about Mills in his judgment, commending her strength in the face of disability. Mills lost her left leg below the knee in a 1993 traffic accident. But he discounted many of the arguments the former model made about her personal wealth before and after her 2002 marriage to McCartney. He ruled that Mills earned far less before marriage than she claimed, and far more while married -- and at several points in his decision, he wrote that Mills' ideas about their marriage were \"make-belief.\" \"I find that, far from the husband dictating to and restricting the wife's career and charitable activities, he did the exact opposite,\" Bennett wrote. McCartney, meanwhile, presented balanced evidence and was a consistent witness, he wrote. \"He expressed himself moderately though at times with justifiable irritation, if not anger,\" the judge wrote in a glimpse of the emotions aired behind closed doors. Read the full ruling (.pdf file -- Adobe Acrobat required) Bennett found Mills failed to produce financial records to back up statements about money she claimed to have in the bank before marriage, which she said amounted to more than \u00a32 million. In one instance, the judge pointed out McCartney's company loaned Mills money to buy a home in Hove, England -- money that she would not have needed had she had such an amount in the bank. And Bennett found that Mills' income actually improved during the marriage. In one year, she earned \u00a31 million ($2 million) from a single modeling contract, he wrote. And he quoted Mills' 2002 book, \"A Single Step,\" in which she wrote that her charity work and public speaking roles had expanded \"to such an extent that it has left little time for anything else.\" \"She is a kindly person and is devoted to her charitable causes,\" the judge wrote. \"She has conducted her own case before me with a steely, yet courteous, determination.\" The couple met in 1999, a year after the death of McCartney's wife of 30 years, Linda. The judge said McCartney continued to grieve for his late wife well into his marriage with Mills -- and he suggested Mills misrepresented her case because she had been star-struck. \"The wife for her part must have felt rather swept off her feet by a man as famous as the husband,\" he wrote. \"I think this may well have warped her perception leading her to indulge in make-belief. The objective facts simply do not support her case.\" Bennett discounted Mills' claims that she was anything more than a loving and devoted wife in helping McCartney. \"The wife's evidence that in some way she was the husband's 'psychologist,' even allowing for hyperbole, is typical of her make-belief,\" the judge wrote. Mills and McCartney failed to agree on a divorce settlement in six days of hearings in February, leaving the judge to decide the terms. Bennett's 58-page decision concluded that \u00a324.3 million was enough for Mills to live comfortably and take care of their daughter's needs. McCartney had proposed a \u00a315.8 million settlement. The judgment included \u00a335,000 a year for Beatrice, \u00a3600,000 for Mills and \u00a32.5 million for her to purchase property in London.

Ricin was found in a room in this Las Vegas, Nevada, extended-stay hotel in February, police say. Roger Bergendorff was taken into custody Wednesday morning in Las Vegas, Nevada, Kolko said. Bergendorff, 57, was hospitalized with what was diagnosed as ricin exposure after the agent was discovered in his hotel room off the Las Vegas Strip. Tests conducted by the FBI determined that the substance contained 2.9 percent active ricin. Its preparation was characterized as \"crude,\" according to the U.S. attorney's office in Las Vegas. According to a press release from the Department of Justice office, a search of Bergendorff's hotel room turned up \"an 'Anarchist's Cookbook,' a collection of instructions on poisons and other dangerous recipes, including instructions on the preparation of ricin,\" two semiautomatic pistols, a rifle and a pistol with a silencer. \"FBI searches of Salt Lake City [Utah] storage units rented by Von Bergendorff resulted in the discovery of castor beans, various chemicals used in the production of ricin, a respirator, filters, painter's mask, laboratory glassware, syringes and a notebook on ricin production,\" the Justice Department release said. Bergendorff is charged with possession of a biological toxin, possession of unregistered firearms and possession of firearms not identified by serial number, according to the U.S. attorney's office. If convicted of all charges, he would face a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a fine of $750,000. Bergendorff is scheduled for an initial court appearance at 3 p.m. Wednesday. It is illegal under federal law to possess a biological agent and toxin unless it is used for bona fide research or other peaceful purpose, U.S. Attorney Gregory Bower said in a written statement. Bergendorff's cousin, Thomas Tholen of Riverton, Utah, was indicted by a federal grand jury in Salt Lake City this month, accused of failing to report production and possession of ricin. Ricin is a poison that can be made from the waste of castor bean processing, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can come in the form of a mist or pellet and can be dissolved in water or weak acid, the agency said. Bergendorff was hospitalized February 14 in Las Vegas after he complained of difficulty breathing. He slipped into a coma and awoke March 14. Bergendorff, 57, is an artist who neighbors said had lived in his cousin's basement before moving to Las Vegas. E-mail to a friend .

Chairman of the Samsung Group Lee Kun-hee has been indicted for tax evasion and breach of trust. The decision of Lee Kun-hee to step down comes a few days after his indictment amid an investigation into corruption allegations. Lee was indicted for tax evasion and breach of trust. Samsung is South Korea's largest conglomerate. It has annual sales of nearly $160 billion and accounts for 18 percent of South Korea's economic output. The company's exports -- valued at about $70 billion -- account for a fifth of all South Korean exports. Lee was indicted for breach of trust in connection with a plan to transfer control of the company to his son, a prosecutor said. He was also indicted for tax evasion. Investigators started looking into Samsung in January, after a former company lawyer said the company created slush funds worth $200 million.

Abu Dujana is suspected of plotting attacks on the Australian Embassy and J.W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta. Abu Dujana is the alleged leader of the military wing of Jemaah Islamiyah, a group that is thought to be linked to al Qaeda. It aims to create a Muslim \"superstate\" across much of Southeast Asia. Dujana, a slight, wiry man, is accused of direct involvement in the Bali nightclub bombings of 2002 that killed more than 200, mostly Western, tourists. He is also suspected of plotting subsequent attacks on the Australian Embassy and J.W. Marriott hotel, both in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. Furthermore, authorities say Dujana is behind the violence in Poso, on Indonesia's eastern Sulawesi island. Fighting between Muslims and Christians periodically breaks out in the region and sometimes turns deadly. Police have accused Jemaah Islamiyah of sending armed militants to Poso. The court found Dujana guilty Monday of illegally possessing firearms and explosives, and of harboring suspected terrorists. His lawyers said they may appeal the sentence. After his arrest last June following a four-year hunt, Dujana admitted to CNN that he was Jemaah Islamiyah's military chief. But he said that happened only after the attacks on Western targets. He described Jemaah Islamiyah to CNN as \"an underground organization,\" saying \"it will continue to exist and continue to move on with its plans\" to create an Islamic state under Sharia law despite his capture. \"When a part of it is cut off ...there will be a replacement, it's only natural,\" he said. Dujana denied being involved in the Marriott Hotel attack. He told CNN that he helped fugitive suspect Noordin Top plan the attack, meeting him both before and after the devastating blast that killed 12 people and injured 150. \"It's true, I did have a meeting with Noordin before the Marriott bombing but that doesn't mean I was involved in the attack,\" he said. \"In that meeting, we're just aligning our views with each other -- there was absolutely no discussion about planning any bombing.\" In his CNN interview, Dujana was quick with messages of hate, calling all Westerners legitimate targets because of the actions of leaders like U.S. President George W. Bush and then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who he says are not giving Muslims the chance to be in power. Dujana studied in Pakistan and fought in Afghanistan from 1988 to 1991. He told CNN that he met al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan during the fight against Soviet occupation. At the time, bin Laden was a field commander and he was an ordinary soldier, he said. Dujana said bin Laden was well respected then and helped him and others realize that it was permissible to kill people to defend Islam. \"I didn't read it in the Quran,\" he said. \" It's based on the teachings of our teachers, clerics, especially what Osama bin Laden first said.\" \"Because of America's arrogance, many in the Muslim world know, believe, it's permissible to kill American soldiers. It's halal; it's permitted,\" he said. The court declared Jemaah Islamiyah a terrorist organization Monday and ordered it to pay 10 million rupiah ($1,088). Around the same time Dujana was captured last June, authorities also apprehended Jemaah Islamiyah's leader, known simply as Zarkasih. A verdict on his case is expected soon. Last week, two other top Jemaah Islamiyah leaders -- Dr. Agus Purwanto and Abdur Rohim -- were brought to Indonesia following their arrest in Malaysia. Both are being investigated for their possible role in fomenting violence in Poso. Terrorism expert Sidney Jones says Abdur Rohim is believed to have replaced Zarkasih as Jemaah Islamiyah leader. \"It is another major blow to Jemaah Islamiyah, but difficult to tell what the impact will be,\" Jones told CNN via e-mail last week. \"It could embolden a more militant faction. [It] could also lead to some serious reassessment within the organization about its future.\" E-mail to a friend .

Neanderthal man apparently sounded like a frog croaking or a human burping when talking. Robert McCarthy of Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton reconstructed Neanderthal vocal tracts to simulate their voice with a computer synthesizer. The result is a single syllable that sounds strange and unremarkable: part croaking frog, part burping human. But McCarthy says that's because Neanderthals lacked the \"quantal vowels\" modern humans use. \"They would have spoken a bit differently,\" McCarthy said at the annual meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists in Ohio this month. \"They wouldn't have been able to produce these quantal vowels that form the basis of spoken language.\" New Scientist magazine discussed McCarthy's findings and linked to his vocal simulation on its Web site.

Pyrotechnic Specialties Inc. is accused of relabeling and selling \"flash-bang\" grenades that the U.S. military rejected after its personnel were injured. The company also mixed defective grenades with others that had been fixed \"to camouflage the defective devices from receiving personnel\" at the FBI, the indictment says. Last week's indictment alleges that company officials bribed a federal official and paid for a visit to a strip club. The officials are accused of conspiracy, money laundering, mail fraud and defrauding the government.  Watch how the grenades work \u00bb . The company, known as PSI, did not immediately respond to calls for comment. The indictment names three company officials -- CEO David J. Karlson, sales representative F. Brad Swann and production manager Daniel Ramone -- as taking part in the conspiracy. The indictment does not say whether they still hold those titles. PSI had a multimillion-dollar contract with the Defense Department to provide stun or \"flash-bang\" grenades, referred to as \"MK141 diversionary charges\" in the indictment. From 1996 to 2007, the Navy awarded three contracts to PSI for the MK141, according to the indictment. The devices are designed to produce a bright flash and loud bang, disorienting their targets. They're considered nonlethal weapons, though they can be dangerous. The indictment alleges, \"On or about March 2003, a flaw in the original Navy design of the MK141 diversionary charge became apparent.\" A plastic piece would sometimes crack, which \"could result in a hazardous situation to those in close proximity.\" \"Improper detonation could, and did, cause serious injuries to personnel using the device,\" according to the indictment. The indictment says that the Department of Defense issued a \"stop work order\" on the devices, and PSI \"developed a procedure to correct the defect\" that cost about $3.72 per unit. PSI officials later engaged in a scheme to sell the defective devices by claiming that they had met the department's standards, the indictment alleges. The defendants sold and attempted to sell the devices \"to the Department of Defense and to federal law enforcement agencies, as well as to state and local law enforcement agencies,\" the indictment says. At one point, some of them prematurely detonated, \"causing serious injuries\" to three FBI agents who were on a SWAT team investigating a kidnapping, the indictment says, adding that the interior of their government vehicle was damaged. \"To further implement the scheme and artifice to defraud, the defendants provided gratuities and additional compensation to a Department of Defense employee,\" the indictment adds. The devices were sold to more than a dozen FBI offices between 2003 and 2004, as well as to the San Rafael Police Department in San Rafael, California, and the Orange County Sheriff/Coroner's Department in Santa Ana, California, the indictment says. The Department of Defense said it could not comment because the case is under investigation. \"Our understanding is that the Naval Criminal Investigative Service is supporting the FBI in this investigation,\" Lt. Geraldine Carey of Marine Corps Systems Command said in a written statement. Carey added that it is \"against DOD policy to discuss matters under investigation prior to the requested official or government agency receiving a formal report.\" According to the company's Web site, PSI supports \"the U.S. and many foreign military services with custom compositions, pellets and devices.\" Automotive airbag products are atop the list of commercial products it manufactures, according to the Web site.

The Pentagon had contracts with three companies with ties to Warren Jeffs' polygamous sect. In fact, some of the deals were made after Jeffs was named to the FBI's \"Most-Wanted List\" and remained in place while he was on the run. CNN has learned that between 1998 and 2007, the United States Air Force and Defense Logistics Agency purchased more than $1.7 million worth of airplane parts from three companies owned by members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which practices polygamy. Those companies are Utah Tool and Die, Western Precision and NewEra Manufacturing. Today, the companies all operate under the name NewEra Manufacturing, a company based in Las Vegas, Nevada, that says it supplies precision components \"for the aerospace, military, medical, recreational and other commercial entities.\" \"It was my understanding that Western Precision was paying roughly $50,000 a week into the coffers of the church,\" former sect member Richard Holm said. \"It would have been close to $200,000 a month.\" Holm said he helped build Western Precision. A court affidavit signed by a man whose father was the president of Western Precision makes similar allegations. \"During 2003, the amount being sent to the storehouse and the FLDS was around $100,000 per month,\" John Nielsen said in the October 26, 2005, affidavit. \"I have personal knowledge that checks sent to the FLDS Church/Warren Jeffs by [Western Precision] are payable to the FLDS Church and/or Warren Jeffs.\" Private investigator Sam Brower, who monitors the sect, said money earned through business dealings with the U.S. government was used to build Jeffs' compounds across the country, including the one recently raided in Eldorado, Texas.

Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell emphasized that point. \"The Department of Defense awards contracts on the basis of who can most effectively meet our requirements for supplies or services at the most reasonable cost to the taxpayer,\" he said. \"We do not consider religious affiliation or marital status when selecting vendors, but illegal activity is certainly cause for termination of a contract and perhaps even debarment, which could prevent a contractor from doing business with department ever again.\" He added, \"However, DoD is not aware of any criminal allegations against anyone managing the companies in question.\" Bob Maginnis, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who now works with a contractor for the Pentagon, said the department does background checks before signing contracts. \"The DoD is obviously abiding by the law, and if we want them to look deeper and discriminate on religious or other activities we need to tell them.\" But he added, \"If there was a direct line between Jeffs and this company, and his name was associated with a contract, then that should have come to attention of those that were bidding contract.\" It's unclear whether Jeffs' name was on any contract, but other senior members of his church were managing the companies. What might taxpayers think of it all? \"They're just going to shake their head and say here's another example of our tax money going down the drain to support this polygamist in Texas who abuses children and women,\" Maginnis said. \"They'll be appalled and rightly so.\" Jeffs is serving time in Utah after his 2007 conviction for being an accomplice to rape, charges related to a marriage he performed in 2001.

He spoke at a prayer service with U.S. bishops at Washington's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the largest Roman Catholic church in North America. Benedict said the sexual abuse of children by priests has caused a \"deep shame\" and called it \"gravely immoral behavior.\" \"Many of you have spoken to me of the enormous pain that your communities have suffered when clerics have betrayed ... their obligations,\" he told the bishops.

A civic group member protests against Hadnott near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo on February 13. Staff Sgt. Tyrone Luther Hadnott, 38, has been charged with the rape of a child under 16, abusive sexual contact with a child, making a false official statement, adultery and kidnapping, the Marines said Friday. No dates for the court-martial have been set. In February, Japanese authorities released Hadnott after the girl dropped the allegations against him, but the Marine Corps conducted its own investigation to see if Hadnott violated codes of military justice. It held him at a Marine facility. The rape accusation against Hadnott stirred memories of a brutal rape more than a decade ago and triggered outrage across Japan. Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda deplored as \"unforgivable\" the allegations against Hadnott. The incident also led to tight restrictions, for a time, for American troops and their families at the U.S. base on Okinawa. The U.S. military in Japan also formed a sexual assault prevention task force after the incident. More than 40,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan, most of them on Okinawa. The troops were placed there under a security alliance after Japan was defeated in World War II and was renounced its right to a military. The U.S. military presence has at times bred resentment among some Japanese, who have long complained about crime, noise and accidents. Anti-American sentiments boiled over in 1995 after three American servicemen kidnapped and gang-raped a 12-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl.

Obama later said the remarks were badly phrased but accurate.  Watch Obama try to clarify his comments \u00bb . On Sunday, Clinton called the comments \"elitist, out of touch and frankly, patronizing,\" and added, \"You know, the Democratic Party, to be very blunt about it, has been viewed as a party that didn't understand and respect the values and the way of life of so many of our fellow Americans.\" Obama opened his remarks to the AP making light of what is being called \"bitter-gate.\" \"I know I kept a lot of you guys busy this weekend with the comments I made last week. Some of you might even be a little bitter about that,\" he said to soft laughter. But his offensive began Sunday night when he mocked Clinton for acting like \"Annie Oakley ... packin' a six-shooter\" in her attempts to connect with gun owners. He was referring to Clinton's efforts over the weekend to appeal to Second Amendment supporters by hinting that she has some experience of her own pulling triggers. \"I disagree with Sen. Obama's assertion that people in our country cling to guns and have certain attitudes about trade and immigration simply out of frustration,\" she began. \"You know, my dad took me out behind the cottage that my grandfather built on a little lake called Lake Winola outside of Scranton and taught me how to shoot when I was a little girl,\" she said. Asked Sunday when she last fired a gun or attended church services, Clinton said the query was \"not a relevant question in this debate.\"  Watch Clinton face questions on gun use \u00bb . Obama blasted Clinton Sunday shortly before the two appeared at Faith in Public Life's Compassion Forum at Messiah College in Grantham, Pennsylvania. \"Shame on her,\" he told a Steelton crowd. \"I expected this out of John McCain,\" Obama said in a decibel higher than his everyday stump tone. \"But I've got to say, I'm a little disappointed when I start hearing the exact same talking points coming out of my Democratic colleague, Hillary Clinton. She knows better. Shame on her.\"  Watch Obama target Clinton \u00bb . On Monday, he attacked her for what happened at an Indiana campaign stop over the weekend. Saying too many candidates are giving voters only rhetoric, the senator from Illinois added, \"They'll promise you anything. They'll even give you a long list of proposals. They'll even come around with TV crews in tow and throw back a shot and a beer.\" With the national media present, Clinton drank a beer and chatted with voters. After ordering her beer, the bartender asked, \"You want a shot with that Hillary?\" After some deliberation, Clinton settled on a shot of Crown Royal, a Canadian whiskey. Responding to Obama's remarks, Clinton spokesman Phil Singer said, \"With all due respect, this is the same politician who spent six days posing for clich\u00e9d camera shots that included bowling gutterballs, walking around a sports bar, feeding a baby cow and buying a ham at the Philly market (albeit one that cost $99.99 a pound). Sen. Obama's speeches won't hide his condescending views of Americans living in small towns.\" Clinton heard a few boos Monday as she continued to criticize Obama. \"I understand my opponent came this morning and spent a lot of his time attacking me,\" she said at the same forum where Obama launched his assault. The crowd responded with audible grumbles, and a few in the hall shouted, \"No!\" Clinton continued, \"I know that many of you, like me, were disappointed by the recent remarks he made.\"  Watch as CNN's Candy Crowley offers a recap of the 'bitter' dispute \u00bb . This time, a louder, sustained chorus of \"No!\" emanated from the audience. \"I am well aware that at a fundraiser in San Francisco he said some things that many people in Pennsylvania and beyond Pennsylvania have found offensive,\" she said.

Germany -- Germany striker Kevin Kuranyi fired Schalke up to joint second in the Bundesliga, while Bayern Munich have a golden chance to put one hand on the league title if they beat Stuttgart on Sunday. Kuranyi's early goal was enough to give Schalke a vital victory over Champions League rivals Hamburg. Kuranyi's 15th league goal of the season -- after just two minutes -- gave Schalke the three points with a 1-0 win in Hamburg to go level on 54 points with Werder Bremen, who shared a thrilling 3-3 draw at Karlsruhe. After Schalke sacked coach Mirko Slomka a fortnight ago, caretaker coach Mike Bueskens was delighted with the victory over their rivals. \"I am very, very pleased with the win,\" he said. \"We beat a direct competitor for a Champions League place and the early goal worked very well for us. Hamburg played well, but they didn't take their chances.\" Schalke and Bremen, who remain second on goal difference, are now nine points behind Bayern with four games left. A Bayern win will send them 12-points clear with a vastly superior goal difference and only a mathematical miracle would prevent them being crowned German champions for the 21st time. But Bayern are without internationals Miroslav Klose and Philipp Lahm against Stuttgart, while Oliver Kahn is a huge injury doubt for the clash against Stuttgart who welcome back Mario Gomez back from injury. The draw in Karlsruhe was a blow to Bremen, who were shocked by an early goal when home striker Sebastian Freis drilled home his 15th minute shot. Werder hit back when midfielder Diego equalised eight minutes later and former Schalke midfielder Mesut Oezil scored his first goal of the season to put Bremen 2-1 ahead on 29 minutes. But Freis added his second on 59 minutes before Kapllani put Karlsruhe ahead only for Bremen striker Boubacar Sanogo to level the scores in the 86th minute. \"It was a very entertaining game and the fans got their money's worth,\" said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf. \"But we can't be happy with the result, because it was possible for us to keep the pressure on.\" Further down the table, striker Mike Hanke gave Hanover an early goal at home to Hertha Berlin before Czech striker Jiri Stajner enjoyed the simplest of tap-ins to make it 2-0 after 26 minutes. But Berlin clawed a goal back with a second-half penalty to make it 2-1 before Lukasz Piszczek equalised in the 66th minute to make it 2-2. At the bottom of the table, Slovakian striker Marek Mintal netted a first-half goal for Nuremberg and Russian striker Ivan Saenko made it 2-0 against Arminia Bielefeld after 39 minutes with a superb strike. But Bielefeld hit back as Artur Wichniarek and Markus Bollmann scored second-half goals to make it 2-2. Energie Cottbus pulled themselves further from the relegation battle with a 2-1 win over Hansa Rostock, while Duisburg have gone bottom of the table with a 1-1 draw against Bochum. On Friday night, mid-table sides Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund drew 1-1 while on Sunday Bayer Leverkusen can break into the top five if they beat Wolfsburg at home.

You'll have to deal with a full frontal assault from the dandelions, of course. And an attack from the crabgrass. But you'll face more stealthy opponents, too: root-chomping grubs and microscopic mildew that turn the grass from green to gray or brown. \"If a lawn is neglected, or cared for in a hit-or-miss way, it gets weak,\" says This Old House landscape contractor Roger Cook. \"And that's when weeds, insects, or fungal diseases become a major problem.\" Little wonder that last year almost 50 million homeowners bought products to fight these invaders. But as in most battles, the best defense is a strong offense: doing everything right to cultivate healthy turf. That means giving it up to an inch and a half of water per week; aerating and dethatching annually so water and nutrients can get down to the roots; mowing with a sharp blade to the right height (ask your local garden center what's best where you live); and fertilizing in spring and fall. So promise yourself -- and your turf -- you'll do that this year. In the meantime, here's how to conquer the most common turf problems you're likely to confront this summer. Fungal disease . Symptoms: Circular patches of yellow-to-brown grass; or blades with tiny red threads. Culprits: Powdery mildew, brown patch, dollar spot, and fusarium patch; or red thread. These fungal diseases can take hold of stressed turf. Solutions: Though lawns will generally recover from small areas of infection, if a fungus is progressively marching across your yard, look for a fungicide with the active ingredient thiophanate-methyl and follow the directions. For an organic fix, search out a corn-gluten mix that will cure brown patch and weaken most other fungi. Then nurse your lawn back to health by practicing good lawn-care habits: Avoid excessive shade (prune back trees and large shrubs, if necessary) and too many applications of fertilizer, herbicides, or pesticides. Carefully monitor your turf's moisture intake and never water in the evening. Weeds . Symptoms: Fast-growing and unruly greenery that quickly overtakes surrounding grass. This Old House: What type of grass is right for your yard . Culprits: Crabgrass or broadleaf weeds such as dandelion, purslane, henbit, and chickweed that commonly pop up where soil is compacted and grass hasn't completely taken root. To check for compacted soil, stick a screwdriver into the ground; it should slide in easily. Solutions: The first step is to eradicate any foreign invaders. The best approach is to pull them out by hand using a weeder or a hoe. This will also loosen the soil in affected areas. Or use a liquid herbicide in a hand sprayer to spot-treat an infestation. If weeds are too plentiful to be pulled, check your garden center for a \"weed-and-feed\" blend of granular fertilizer and herbicide that will kill weeds without harming turf types commonly grown in your area, or look for an organic fertilizer with corn gluten. Be sure to follow the directions on the box exactly, as some formulas must be applied during a dry spell or need a 24-hour breather with no foot traffic. From here on out, mow up to twice a week during the beginning of summer when grass grows swiftly, and raise the mower blade an inch during hot or dry periods. Water well as the summer heats up, and your turf should naturally overtake the weeds. In the fall, open up compacted soil poke holes with a pitchfork over a small yard, or rent a power aerator for large yards and overseed the lawn. You may want to follow up with a pre-emergent herbicide next spring. Insects . Symptoms: Brown turf that becomes loose enough to lift like a mat. Culprits: White grubs, a catch-all name for root-chomping beetle larvae, including june bugs, Japanese beetles, and masked chafers. To be sure that's what you've got, cut a square foot of infected turf and roll it back, looking for pale, half-inch- to inch-long C-shaped bugs. If you find more than six, treat the turf. This Old House:  Meet the good bugs . Solutions: Grubs are the biggest threat to lawns, and pesticides formulated with imidacloprid are proven effective. For an organic fix, spread powdered milky spore or lay down beneficial nematodes-microscopic worms that will feed on the grubs if they're present. With nematodes, timing the application with their life cycle is critical, so be sure to follow the directions on the box exactly. Both milky spore and nematodes can be ordered from some garden centers or online (gardensalive.com). Symptoms: Irregular-shaped patches of brownish-yellow grass. Culprits: Chinch bugs, gray-black, quarter-inch-long insects that suck moisture from grass and are most likely to attack St. Augustine and zoysia grasses in the South and Kentucky bluegrass in the North. To spot them, bury an empty coffee can, with both ends removed, at the edge of the affected area and fill it with water. The bugs will seek out the moisture, then float to the top. If you see more than 10 after 20 minutes, you should address the problem. Solutions: Chinch bugs live on the surface, among thatch, so dethatching will reduce their numbers. To eradicate them completely, look for an appropriate insecticide with a pyrethroid ingredient. Longer-term, overseed with chinch-bug-resistant grasses. Symptoms: Patches of thin lawn with blades chewed off at the base. Culprits: Sod webworms and tropical sod webworms, hairless cream-to-gray spotted caterpillars that grow into small, buff-colored moths at maturity. The tropical species that thrive in warm southern climates cause the most harm. To check for webworms, mix two tablespoons of mild detergent with two gallons of water; pour it over the infested turf. Any larvae will float to the top. Solutions: You can try flooding your lawn to drown them. Or choose an appropriate insecticide; in an organic product, look for the ingredients azadirachtin or spinosad. With extreme cases of tropical webworm infestation you may need to replace the turf with a resistant grass mix. TIP: If dogs regularly make a pit stop of your lawn, keep a hose or water bucket nearby. Dog urine is high in nitrogen, which can \"burn\" turf, creating a good-sized yellow patch. The best fix is immediate action: Flush the area ASAP with water to dilute it. Once badly burned, grass won't come back on its own-you'll have to rake out the dead stuff and reseed.

No injuries were immediately reported. The first tornado hit St. Charles, Maryland -- about 30 miles south of Washington -- just after 2 p.m. It uprooted several trees, many of which fell onto cars and homes. The strongest wind from that touchdown was 80 mph -- enough force to blow out windows. A second tornado followed about 30 minutes later outside Hyattsville, Maryland -- about 10 miles northeast of the capital. The high-speed winds, peaking at 100 mph, hit the George E.

The bomb explodes near Bhutto's vehicle following a political rally in Rawalpindi. The conclusions of the inquiry were outlined in a detailed report handed over to interim Interior Minister Hamid Nawaz by Detective Superintendent John MacBrayne, accompanied by a senior official from the British High Commission, during a meeting in Islamabad. The text of the executive summary of the report is as follows: . On the 27th December 2007, Mohtarma Benazir BHUTTO, the leader of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), died as a result of being attacked in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Following discussions between the Prime Minister and President Musharraf, it was agreed that officers from the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command (SO15) should support the investigation into Ms Bhutto's death. The primary focus of the Scotland Yard team was to assist the Pakistani authorities in establishing the cause and circumstances of Ms Bhutto's death. The wider investigation to establish culpability has remained entirely a matter for the Pakistani authorities. The SO15 team was led by a Detective Superintendent Senior Investigating Officer, and comprised two forensic experts, an expert in analysing and assessing video media and an experienced investigating officer. The team arrived in Pakistan on 4th January 2008 and spent two and a half weeks conducting extensive enquiries. During the course of their work, the team were joined by other specialists from the United Kingdom. The UK team were given extensive support and co-operation by the Pakistani authorities, Ms Bhutto's family, and senior officials from Ms Bhutto's party. The task of establishing exactly what happened was complicated by the lack of an extended and detailed search of the crime scene, the absence of an autopsy, and the absence of recognised body recovery and victim identification processes. Nevertheless, the evidence that is available is sufficient for reliable conclusions to be drawn. Within the overall objective, a particular focus has been placed on establishing the actual cause of death, and whether there were one or more attackers in the immediate vicinity of Ms Bhutto. The cause of death . Considerable reliance has been placed upon the X-rays taken at Rawalpindi General Hospital following Ms Bhutto's death. Given their importance, the x-rays have been independently verified as being of Ms Bhutto by comparison with her dental x-rays. Additionally, a valuable insight was gained from the accounts given by the medical staff involved in her treatment, and from those members of Ms Bhutto's family who washed her body before burial. Ms Bhutto's only apparent injury was a major trauma to the right side of the head. The UK experts all exclude this injury being an entry or exit wound as a result of gunshot. The only X-ray records, taken after her death, were of Ms Bhutto's head. However, the possibility of a bullet wound to her mid or lower trunk can reasonably be excluded. This is based upon the protection afforded by the armoured vehicle in which she was travelling at the time of the attack, and the accounts of her family and hospital staff who examined her. The limited X-ray material, the absence of a full post mortem examination and CT scan, have meant that the UK Home Office pathologist, Dr Nathaniel Cary, who has been consulted in this case, is unable categorically to exclude the possibility of there being a gunshot wound to the upper trunk or neck. However when his findings are put alongside the accounts of those who had close contact with Ms Bhutto's body, the available evidence suggests that there was no gunshot injury. Importantly, Dr Cary excludes the possibility of a bullet to the neck or upper trunk as being a relevant factor in the actual cause of death, when set against the nature and extent of her head injury. In his report Dr Cary states: . \u2022 \"the only tenable cause for the rapidly fatal head injury in this case is that it occurred as the result of impact due to the effects of the bomb-blast.\" \u2022 \"in my opinion Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto died as a result of a severe head injury sustained as a consequence of the bomb-blast and due to head impact somewhere in the escape hatch of the vehicle.\" Given the severity of the injury to Ms Bhutto's head, the prospect that she inadvertently hit her head whilst ducking down into the vehicle can be excluded as a reasonable possibility. High explosives of the type typically used in this sort of device, detonate at a velocity between 6000 and 9000 metres per second. This means that when considering the explosive quantities and distances involved, such an explosion would generate significantly more force than would be necessary to provoke the consequences as occurred in this case. It is also important to comment upon the construction of the vehicle. It was fitted with B6 grade armour and designed to withstand gunfire and bomb-blast. It is an unfortunate and misleading aspect of this case that the roof escape hatch has frequently been referred to as a sunroof. It is not. It is designed and intended to be used solely as a means of escape. It has a solid lip with a depth of 9cm. Ms Bhutto's injury is entirely consistent with her head impacting upon the lip of the escape hatch. Detailed analysis of the media footage provides supporting evidence. Ms Bhutto's head did not completely disappear from view until 0.6 seconds before the blast. She can be seen moving forward and to the right as she ducked down into the vehicle. Whilst her exact head position at the time of the detonation can never be ascertained, the overwhelming conclusion must be that she did not succeed in getting her head entirely below the lip of the escape hatch when the explosion occurred. How many people were involved in the immediate attack? There has been speculation that two individuals were directly involved in the attack. The suggestion has been that one suspect fired shots, and a second detonated the bomb. All the available evidence points toward the person who fired shots and the person who detonated the explosives being one and the same person. \u2022 Body parts from only one individual remain unidentified. Expert opinion provides strong evidence that they originate from the suicide bomber. \u2022 Analysis of the media footage places the gunman at the rear of the vehicle and looking down immediately before the explosion. The footage does not show the presence of any other potential bomber.  \u2022 This footage when considered alongside the findings of the forensic explosive expert, that the bombing suspect was within 1 to 2 metres of the vehicle towards it rear and with no person or other obstruction between him and the vehicle, strongly suggests that the bomber and gunman were at the same position. It is virtually inconceivable that anyone who was where the gunman can clearly be seen on the media footage, could have survived the blast and escaped. The inevitable conclusion is that there was one attacker in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle in which Ms Bhutto was travelling. In essence, all the evidence indicates that one suspect has fired the shots before detonating an improvised explosive device. At the time of the attack this person was standing close to the rear of Ms Bhutto's vehicle. The blast caused a violent collision between her head and the escape hatch area of the vehicle, causing a severe and fatal head injury.

Lawyer Hassan Jabbar lies in a hospital after being injured in a shooting involving Blackwater contractors. The results of the Iraqi investigation into the shootings is complete and will be presented to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government for review, the official said. The report calls for the payments to go to the families of each of those killed in the shootings, he said. Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said Sunday that the Iraqi commission investigating the shootings has accused the company's guards of firing indiscriminately and without provocation on citizens and violating the rights of Iraqis. Blackwater said its contractors \"acted lawfully and appropriately in response to a hostile attack,\" and \"the civilians reportedly fired upon by Blackwater professionals were, in fact, armed enemies, and Blackwater personnel returned defensive fire.\" The September 16 shooting also left 27 other people wounded, al-Dabbagh said. Seven vehicles were also destroyed in the incident, which occurred around Nusoor Square in western Baghdad. Al-Dabbagh said the commission, formed September 22, determined there was no evidence the Blackwater convoy was under direct or indirect fire. \"Not even a stone was thrown at them,\" al-Dabbagh said. He added the contractors violated the rules of conduct and regulations for private security firms operating in Iraq. \"They must be held accountable according to the law,\" he said.

Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni attend the opening of the mosque. Several of the guards to the visiting heads of state from Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Mali, Somalia, Sudan and Djibouti sustained serious injuries in the fight, which included punches, kicks and the drawing of guns. No leaders were hurt in the melee, though several were knocked over. Several journalists also were caught up in the fracas and suffered injuries or lost their grips on cameras and recorders. The incident occurred at the opening of a massive Gadhafi National Mosque in Kampala, a structure begun by the late Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in 1972 and completed with financing from Libya, according to African media reports. Minutes after Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and his host, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, jointly unveiled a plaque to mark the event, the Libyan guards pushed away the guards of other delegations at the mosque's entrance. The Ugandan guards -- who had traded hostilities with the predominantly-Arab Libyan guards at every joint event since Gadhafi's arrival in the country Sunday -- reacted with fury and fought back. Museveni briefly lost his balance when a hefty Libyan guard pushed him to a wall. Another Libyan guard pushed Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who also lost his balance but was caught by his own guards. The vice president of Tanzania was knocked over by fighting guards as he was taking his shoes off to enter the mosque. Guards to the rest of the visiting presidents and prime ministers kept their respective leaders out of the fray, with some drawing their guns as the dignitaries looked on in disbelief. Some leaders -- notably those from Somalia, Burundi and Djibouti -- were visibly uneasy as guns were drawn on all sides. By the time the fight was over more than six minutes later, about a dozen presidential guards were left bleeding from compound fractures and the Libyan and Ugandan protocol officials traded bitter accusations of disrespect and racism. \"What are your people up to? Do you want to kill our leader?\" a Libyan protocol official said to his Ugandan counterpart. The Ugandan official, who declined to be named, shouted back, \"Why do think you're superior? What makes you think Uganda has any ill intention against Gadhafi?\" The Ugandan official said Museveni's guards were simply doing their job as security for the host country and had a right to respond when the Libyan guards pushed them back. It has taken 36 years to complete the giant mosque on a hill in the heart of Kampala. It used to be a colonial fort named after British Capt. Frederick Lugard. The mosque can accommodate as many as 17,000 people at one time, according to the engineers, who call it the largest mosque in sub-Saharan Africa. Many Muslims interviewed said the mosque's opening evoked sweet memories of Amin, the deceased dictator. \"It is a great day and thanks be to Allah for the completion,\" said Salim Abdul Noor, 39. \"This should remind us that while Amin is demonized as Africa's worst dictator, there are many things he did for this country that successive governments largely depend on, and much of the completed installations and structures like this beautiful mosque was Amin's dream, may Allah rest him in peace.\" The Swedish vice president of the European Islamic Conference, Adly Abu Hajar, 57, said the mosque heals rifts in a religion introduced to Uganda in 1844 by Arab slave traders. \"I find this complex has brought unity among Muslims in Uganda. There have been so many factions, but this attraction has brought them together, identifying themselves with a common home.\" The fight prompted a crisis meeting by Ugandan security authorities, after which invited diplomats from mainly the European missions in Uganda expressed dismay. \"It's disgrace. It shows there is something wrong yet unknown between the two parties,\" said the head of one European mission in Kampala, who declined to be named. The police chief, Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura, and the head of the army, Gen. Aronda Nyakairima, declined to comment on the fight. But Capt. Edison Kwesiga, the spokesman of the Ugandan Presidential Guard Brigade, confirmed their hostile relationship with the Libyans. \"It is our responsibility to ensure the safety of any visiting head of state. We have to do our job using any means. But our Libyan brothers always want us to fail. True, it's not the first time they come and act as you see,\" Kwesiga said.

Iraqi security forces gather around the site of a car bomb explosion in Baghdad on Monday. The incident occurred one-half mile from the Imam Hussein shrine of Karbala. Karbala is a Shiite holy city, and the Imam Hussein shrine is one of Shiite Islam's holiest locations. The shrine marks the burial spot of Hussein bin Ali, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, who was killed in battle nearby in 680. No more information was immediately available about the blast southwest of the capital city, Baghdad. Earlier Monday, in Baghdad, a roadside bomb exploded near an Iraqi police patrol, killing one officer and wounding another, the Interior Ministry told CNN. A short time later, another roadside bomb exploded near an Iraqi police patrol on Palestine Street in eastern Baghdad, wounding four bystanders, a ministry official said. The first attack took place about 8:30 a.m. in the upscale Mansour neighborhood, where law enforcement officials have come under frequent attacks in recent weeks. Also Monday, two American soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb north of Baghdad, officials said. The incident occurred about 12:20 p.m.  as the soldiers were \"conducting a route-clearance combat operation north of Baghdad,\" according to a news release. The names of the soldiers were not immediately released. Meanwhile, U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney arrived in the Iraqi capital Monday on an unannounced visit. Cheney told reporters that the five years in Iraq since the war's start has been \"well worth the effort.\" He said he met with top Iraqi officials.  He appeared at a news conference with Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to the country. Cheney began a trip to the Middle East on Sunday with an official itinerary that listed stops in Oman, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Israel and the West Bank, according to the White House.

Comaneci scored seven perfect 10s in Montreal in 1976. Just 14-years-old and standing less than five feet tall, the elfin Romanian was the undisputed star of that year's Games in Montreal after becoming the first gymnast in history to score a perfect 10. Comaneci finished up with three gold medals and -- just to prove that her initial effort had been no fluke -- seven perfect scores. Her initial performance on the uneven parallel bars was greeted with uproar as the three-digit scoreboard, struggling to cope with what had been considered an unachievable feat, flashed up 1.00. Comaneci finished with four perfect 10s and the gold medal on the bars, but it was on the balance beam, one of gymnastics' most dangerous disciplines, that Comaneci truly dazzled. Seemingly fearless, Comaneci pirouetted and back-flipped her way to two more perfect 10s and her second gold. Her final perfect score came in the floor routine as she also collected first place in the overall competition. Comaneci's transformation into an international celebrity -- she appeared on the front covers of Time, Newsweek and Sports Illustrated in the same week -- had been as unexpected as it was sudden. Yet Comaneci had been working towards the Olympics ever since she had been picked out as a gymnast of rare talents as a six-year-old growing up in the industrial town of Onesti. The reality of life as an Olympic champion at home in Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania however, was not easy. Constant surveillance Comaneci was honored as a Hero of Socialist Labor on her return home, yet the regime -- terrified that Comaneci would defect after enjoying her taste of western celebrity -- kept its greatest star under constant surveillance. Four years later, a very different Comaneci returned to Olympic competition in Moscow. As an 18-year-old, she was four inches taller, 20 pounds heavier and suffering from sciatica -- a teenage starlet already starting to fade. Still, Comaneci was able to retain her gold medal on the balance beam, and collected another one in the floor exercises. But she was also involved in one of the bitterest incidents of the Games when she was controversially beaten in the all-round competition by the Soviet gymnast Yelena Davydova. It took the judges 28 minutes to decide the result and, ultimately, it was a lower score from the Soviet judge -- perhaps reflecting the worsening relations between the Soviet Union and its formerly loyal satellite -- that denied Comaneci her second straight gold in the event. Comaneci retired in 1984, traveling to Los Angeles that year as a team coach, yet she found it difficult to adjust to a life out of the spotlight. In 1989, a few weeks before the collapse of the Ceausescu regime, she defected to the United States, finally settling in Norman, Oklahoma to run a gymnastics school after marrying U.S. gymnastics star Bart Conner in 1996. In 2000 Comaneci was named as one of the athletes of the century by the Laureus World Sports Academy.

You'll have to deal with a full frontal assault from the dandelions, of course. And an attack from the crabgrass. But you'll face more stealthy opponents, too: root-chomping grubs and microscopic mildew that turn the grass from green to gray or brown. \"If a lawn is neglected, or cared for in a hit-or-miss way, it gets weak,\" says This Old House landscape contractor Roger Cook. \"And that's when weeds, insects, or fungal diseases become a major problem.\" Little wonder that last year almost 50 million homeowners bought products to fight these invaders. But as in most battles, the best defense is a strong offense: doing everything right to cultivate healthy turf. That means giving it up to an inch and a half of water per week; aerating and dethatching annually so water and nutrients can get down to the roots; mowing with a sharp blade to the right height (ask your local garden center what's best where you live); and fertilizing in spring and fall. So promise yourself -- and your turf -- you'll do that this year. In the meantime, here's how to conquer the most common turf problems you're likely to confront this summer. Fungal disease . Symptoms: Circular patches of yellow-to-brown grass; or blades with tiny red threads. Culprits: Powdery mildew, brown patch, dollar spot, and fusarium patch; or red thread. These fungal diseases can take hold of stressed turf. Solutions: Though lawns will generally recover from small areas of infection, if a fungus is progressively marching across your yard, look for a fungicide with the active ingredient thiophanate-methyl and follow the directions. For an organic fix, search out a corn-gluten mix that will cure brown patch and weaken most other fungi. Then nurse your lawn back to health by practicing good lawn-care habits: Avoid excessive shade (prune back trees and large shrubs, if necessary) and too many applications of fertilizer, herbicides, or pesticides. Carefully monitor your turf's moisture intake and never water in the evening. Weeds . Symptoms: Fast-growing and unruly greenery that quickly overtakes surrounding grass. This Old House: What type of grass is right for your yard . Culprits: Crabgrass or broadleaf weeds such as dandelion, purslane, henbit, and chickweed that commonly pop up where soil is compacted and grass hasn't completely taken root. To check for compacted soil, stick a screwdriver into the ground; it should slide in easily. Solutions: The first step is to eradicate any foreign invaders. The best approach is to pull them out by hand using a weeder or a hoe. This will also loosen the soil in affected areas. Or use a liquid herbicide in a hand sprayer to spot-treat an infestation. If weeds are too plentiful to be pulled, check your garden center for a \"weed-and-feed\" blend of granular fertilizer and herbicide that will kill weeds without harming turf types commonly grown in your area, or look for an organic fertilizer with corn gluten. Be sure to follow the directions on the box exactly, as some formulas must be applied during a dry spell or need a 24-hour breather with no foot traffic. From here on out, mow up to twice a week during the beginning of summer when grass grows swiftly, and raise the mower blade an inch during hot or dry periods. Water well as the summer heats up, and your turf should naturally overtake the weeds. In the fall, open up compacted soil poke holes with a pitchfork over a small yard, or rent a power aerator for large yards and overseed the lawn. You may want to follow up with a pre-emergent herbicide next spring. Insects . Symptoms: Brown turf that becomes loose enough to lift like a mat. Culprits: White grubs, a catch-all name for root-chomping beetle larvae, including june bugs, Japanese beetles, and masked chafers. To be sure that's what you've got, cut a square foot of infected turf and roll it back, looking for pale, half-inch- to inch-long C-shaped bugs. If you find more than six, treat the turf. This Old House:  Meet the good bugs . Solutions: Grubs are the biggest threat to lawns, and pesticides formulated with imidacloprid are proven effective. For an organic fix, spread powdered milky spore or lay down beneficial nematodes-microscopic worms that will feed on the grubs if they're present. With nematodes, timing the application with their life cycle is critical, so be sure to follow the directions on the box exactly. Both milky spore and nematodes can be ordered from some garden centers or online (gardensalive.com). Symptoms: Irregular-shaped patches of brownish-yellow grass. Culprits: Chinch bugs, gray-black, quarter-inch-long insects that suck moisture from grass and are most likely to attack St. Augustine and zoysia grasses in the South and Kentucky bluegrass in the North. To spot them, bury an empty coffee can, with both ends removed, at the edge of the affected area and fill it with water. The bugs will seek out the moisture, then float to the top. If you see more than 10 after 20 minutes, you should address the problem. Solutions: Chinch bugs live on the surface, among thatch, so dethatching will reduce their numbers. To eradicate them completely, look for an appropriate insecticide with a pyrethroid ingredient. Longer-term, overseed with chinch-bug-resistant grasses. Symptoms: Patches of thin lawn with blades chewed off at the base. Culprits: Sod webworms and tropical sod webworms, hairless cream-to-gray spotted caterpillars that grow into small, buff-colored moths at maturity. The tropical species that thrive in warm southern climates cause the most harm. To check for webworms, mix two tablespoons of mild detergent with two gallons of water; pour it over the infested turf. Any larvae will float to the top. Solutions: You can try flooding your lawn to drown them. Or choose an appropriate insecticide; in an organic product, look for the ingredients azadirachtin or spinosad. With extreme cases of tropical webworm infestation you may need to replace the turf with a resistant grass mix. TIP: If dogs regularly make a pit stop of your lawn, keep a hose or water bucket nearby. Dog urine is high in nitrogen, which can \"burn\" turf, creating a good-sized yellow patch. The best fix is immediate action: Flush the area ASAP with water to dilute it. Once badly burned, grass won't come back on its own-you'll have to rake out the dead stuff and reseed.

The Democratic Party has stripped the state of its delegates for moving up its primary date so early, and top-tier Democratic candidates have taken their names off the ballot, except for Sen. Hillary Clinton. The struggling auto industry has been a drag on Michigan's economy. In many ways, the Republican battle for Michigan will be similar to last week's New Hampshire contest. The primary is open, and any registered voter -- including independents and Democrats -- can participate. Sen. John McCain won New Hampshire with the help of independent voters, and he is campaigning hard to re-create that success in Michigan. In 2000, McCain defeated then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the Michigan primary. In that vote, more than half -- 52 percent -- were either independents or Democrats. Among Republican voters, McCain lost to Bush 29 percent to 66 percent. In that contest, almost three out of every 10 voters identified themselves as members of the religious right. Overall, Michigan is a swing state, producing narrow margins of victory for presidential candidates and statewide officeholders. However, voting trends favor the Democrats. Michigan's governor, Jennifer Granholm, is a Democrat, as are the state's two U.S. senators -- Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow. The Democratic presidential nominee has carried Michigan in the last four elections. Sen. John Kerry, the Democrats' 2004 standard bearer, won Michigan 51 percent to 48 percent over President Bush. The state's economy is powered by the automotive industry, which has experienced its fair share of struggles. Michigan's unemployment rate, 7.4 percent, is higher than the national average of 5 percent. Region by region . Wayne County, in the southeastern corner of the state, contains the economically depressed Detroit, Michigan's largest city. Detroit is predominantly black and solidly Democratic. North of Wayne County are the more-affluent suburban counties of Oakland and Macomb, which have grown in population in the last two decades. These two counties have been the state's central political battleground in recent elections. West of Wayne is the \"university belt,\" home to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Michigan State University in East Lansing. The area also includes the industrial cities of Saginaw and Flint, where unions remain strong, as well as Jackson and Bay City. The state's capital, Lansing, and the sparsely populated upper peninsula are also part of this region. The southwest part of the state is dominated by Grand Rapids, Michigan's second-largest city. Grand Rapids is traditionally Dutch-American and has many Christian conservatives and generally votes Republican. The area also contains smaller industrial cities and farming communities. The economy of the sparsely populated north and northwest is based on agriculture, tourism and timber. It traditionally votes Republican. Endorsements . The Detroit Free Press has endorsed McCain. \"While the Free Press differs with McCain on a number of issues, the Arizona senator is a smarter, more tested and pragmatic leader who has shown since 2000 that he knows how to build bipartisan alliances around issues,\" the newspaper said in an editorial. The Detroit News also endorsed McCain, citing his fiscal conservatism and command of military and foreign affairs, over Michigan native Mitt Romney. \"Other GOP contenders, most notably former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, are capable figures with impressive resumes and a solid grasp of the issues. But McCain's longtime presidential ambitions are at last aligned with the needs of the nation,\" the newspaper said.

Troops emerge from a bunker after receiving the \"all clear\" Sunday following a truck bombing in Mosul. The four were killed when their vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device while patrolling a neighborhood in southern Baghdad, the U.S. military headquarters in Iraq reported Sunday night. A fifth soldier was wounded in the attack, which took place about 10 p.m. (3 p.m. ET). The U.S. milestone comes just days after Americans marked the fifth anniversary of the start of the war. \"No casualty is more or less significant than another; each soldier, Marine, airman and sailor is equally precious and their loss equally tragic,\" Rear Admiral Gregory Smith, the U.S. military's chief spokesman in Iraq, said. \"Every single loss of a soldier, sailor, airman or Marine is keenly felt by military commanders, families and friends both in theatre and at home,\" Smith said. Of the 4,000 U.S. military personnel killed in the war, 3,263 have been killed in attacks and fighting and 737 in non-hostile incidents, such as traffic accidents and suicides. Eight of the 4,000 killed were civilians working for the Pentagon. Many of those killed over the years, like the four soldiers slain on Sunday in Baghdad, have been targeted by improvised explosive devices -- the roadside bombs that have been described as the weapon of choice for insurgents and a weapon that has come to symbolize Iraq's tenacious insurgency. The existence of the Pentagon's Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization has been developed to counter the threat of IEDs in Iraq as well as Afghanistan. The group calls IEDs the \"weapon of choice for adaptive and resilient networks of insurgents and terrorists.\"  Watch how IEDs have become deadly staple in Iraq war \u00bb . Meanwhile, estimates of the Iraqi death toll range from about 80,000 to the hundreds of thousands, with another 2 million forced to leave the country and 2.5 million people displaced within Iraq, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. President Bush ordered U.S. troops into Iraq on March 19, 2003, after months of warnings that then-Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was concealing stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and efforts to build a nuclear bomb. U.N. weapons inspectors found no sign of banned weapons before the invasion, and the CIA later concluded that Iraq had dismantled its weapons programs in the 1990s. Hussein's government fell in early April 2003, and Iraq's new government executed him in December 2006. The news of the 4,000 mark came on the same day that Iraq's national security adviser urged Americans to be patient with the progress of the war, contending that it is \"well worth fighting\" because it has implications about \"global terror.\" \"This is global terrorism hitting everywhere, and they have chosen Iraq to be a battlefield. And we have to take them on,\" Mowaffak al-Rubaie said Sunday on CNN's \"Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer.\" \"If we don't prevail, if we don't succeed in this war, then we are doomed forever,\" he said. \"I understand and sympathize with the mothers, with the widows, with the children who have lost their beloved ones in this country. \"But honestly, it is well worth fighting and well worth investing the money and the treasure and the sweat and the tears in Iraq.\" Nearly 160,000 U.S. troops remain in Iraq, and the war has cost U.S. taxpayers about $600 billion, according to the House Budget Committee. The conflict is now widely unpopular among Americans: A CNN-Opinion Research Corp. poll out Wednesday found only 32 percent of Americans support the conflict. And 61 percent said they want the next president to remove most U.S. troops within a few months of taking office. In the weekly Democratic radio address Saturday, Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey said President Bush \"took us to war on the wings of a lie.\" Menendez said that the war has depleted the resources and morale of the U.S. military; diverted national attention away from the war in Afghanistan, where al Qaeda is regrouping; and hurt the hunt for Osama bin Laden. The Iraq war has not made Americans safer, Menendez said, but has instead hurt the U.S. economy. The senator called for a \"responsible new direction\" regarding Iraq. CNN learned last week, from several U.S. military officials familiar with the recommendations but not authorized to speak on the record, that senior U.S. military officials are preparing to recommend to Bush a four- to six-week \"pause\" in additional troop withdrawals from Iraq after the last of the \"surge\" brigades leaves in July. \"If the conditions on the ground dictate that we have to have a pause, then we will have to have a pause,\" al-Rubaie said. The return of all five brigades added to the Iraq contingent last year could reduce troop levels by up to 30,000, but still leave approximately 130,000 or more troops in Iraq. Al-Rubaie emphasized Sunday that any drawdown of U.S. troops \"has to be based on the conditions on the ground.\" \"It depends on the development and the growth and the equipment and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces, and the preparedness of the Iraqi security forces,\" he said. \"This should not be a purely political decision. It should be also a technical, military and intelligence decision.\" But there has been too much \"foot-dragging on key governance questions in Iraq,\" Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said on CNN on Sunday. \"It seems to me you put off those troop withdrawals, you send exactly the wrong message to the Iraqis.\" On Wednesday, Bush will visit the Pentagon to be briefed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, chaired by Adm. Michael Mullen. The American troop level in Iraq \"depends on the negotiations that we are engaged in now between the government of Iraq and the United States government,\" al-Rubaie said. When conditions warrant the withdrawal of American troops, the Iraqis will say \"'Thank you very much, indeed,' \" al-Rubaie said. \"A big, big thank you for the United States of America for liberating Iraq, for helping us in sustaining the security gains in Iraq ... and we will give them a very, very good farewell party then.\" Responding to recent remarks from U.S. presidential candidates that Iraqis are not taking responsibility for their own future, al-Rubaie said Iraqis are making political and security gains. \"Literally by the day and by the week, we are gradually assuming more responsibility,\" he said, noting that Iraqis have taken responsibility for security in many provinces. Other developments: . \u2022 U.S. troops raided a suspected suicide bomber cell in Diyala province on Sunday, killing a dozen militants, half of whom had shaved their bodies -- which the U.S. military says indicates they were in the final stage of preparation for a suicide attack.

The U.S. military put the death toll higher, at 12. \u2022 A mortar round landed in a Shiite neighborhood in eastern Baghdad, killing seven people and injuring nine others, a ministry official said. Six more mortar rounds landed in other Baghdad neighborhoods Sunday night, killing three people, the Interior Ministry said. \u2022 In southeastern Baghdad, gunmen riding in at least two cars opened fire on a crowded outdoor market, killing at least three people and wounding 17 others, the Interior Ministry said. \u2022 A suicide bomber detonated a small truck rigged with explosives outside a local Awakening Council leader's house just east of Samarra on Saturday, killing at least five people and wounding 13 others, a Samarra police official said.

Adam Gilchrist takes a spectacular catch off Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the third Test against India. The 36-year-old chose Australia Day to make his decision public, coming at the end of the third day of the fourth and final Test against India in Adelaide. Gilchrist said he would retire from Tests at the end of the current match, and then hang up his gloves in one-day internationals after the upcoming tri-series with Sri Lanka and India. \"It is with great pride and happiness that I make the decision to retire from Tests and one-day internationals,\" he said in a statement on Saturday. \"I've come to the decision after much thought and discussion with those most important to me. \"My family and I have been fortunate to have had an amazing journey full of rich experiences throughout my career and are sincerely grateful to all who have helped make this stage of our lives so fulfilling. \"I am now ready and excited to move into the next phase of my life which will, of paramount importance, include much more time with my family.\" Gilchrist broke the world record for the most wicketkeeping dismissals in Tests with 414 on Friday, overtaking South Africa's Mark Boucher in his 96th outing in the five-day game. Boucher, by comparison, played in 109 Tests. Gilchrist took over the gloves from Ian Healy -- third on the list with 395 dismissals from 119 Tests -- in November 1999, and went on to establish himself both as a wicketkeeper and as a batsman of brutal hitting capabilities. He has scored 5,556 runs to date, at an average of 47.89, with a highest score of 204 not out and having made 17 centuries. He has been similarly prolific in 277 one-dayers, scoring 9,297 runs at an average of 36 and reaching three figures 15 times. Gilchrist's revelation came as Australia put themselves in a strong position to win the series against the touring Indians, reaching 322-3 at stumps. Captain Ricky Ponting, whose team lead 2-1, was unbeaten on 79 after adding an unbroken 81 for the fourth wicket with Michael Clarke (37). Resuming the day on 62-0 in reply to India's imposing first innings of 526, Matthew Hayden and Phil Jaques took their opening stand to 159. Jaques was the first to fall, bowled by India captain Anil Kumble for a patient 60 off 159 deliveries. Hayden, on his return after missing the defeat in Perth due to a hamstring injury, reached his 30th Test century before being bowled by 19-year-old seamer Ishant Sharma for 103 off 200 balls. Ponting, who came in at first drop, added another 55 with Mike Hussey before the left-hander was also castled by fast bowler Irfan Pathan for 22 to leave the home side teetering a little at 241-3. But Ponting, who has struggled for form so far in the series, ground out his 40th half-century in Tests and Clarke provided able support to take Australia through to the close of play with no further loss of wickets.

Eduardo Gutierrez can't send money back to his parents in Mexico due to rising costs and less work. He can no longer afford to send the $200 to $300 a month he had been sending back home to support his ailing father. \"I kind of feel bad that I can't help my parents,\" said Gutierrez, a legal immigrant who has worked in the United States for 20 years. \"I try.

Watch bad times in the U.S. felt in Mexico \u00bb . Bank of Mexico, Mexico's equivalent to the Federal Reserve, says stories like these are becoming more common. Deceleration in the U.S. construction industry resulted in $100 million less in \"remittances\" -- money from workers in the U.S. to their relatives in Mexico -- in January this year, the most recent available stats. The overall figure went from $1.7 billion in January 2007 to $1.6 billion this January, according to Bank of Mexico. The slowdown in such money has been a consistent theme over the last year. The World Bank says remittances received by people in Mexico nearly ground to a halt in 2007, growing at a rate of 1.4 percent, compared with more than 20 percent annual growth from 2002 to 2006. \"The slowdown in Mexico is partly due to the weak job market in the United States, especially in the construction sector,\" the World Bank says on its Web site. A poll, released Wednesday, of 5,000 Latin American adults living in the United States found that only 50 percent of respondents were still sending money on a regular basis to loved ones, down from 73 percent in a similar poll conducted in 2006. The poll was conducted in February by the Inter-American Development Bank's Multilateral Investment Fund.  See the rise of immigrants from Latin America \u00bb .

He and his wife have 13 children, seven of whom have moved to the United States for work, including Eduardo Gutierrez. The dad used the money from his oldest son to supplement his farming income and to help pay for diabetes medication. \"He says things are getting too expensive over there,\" the father said. \"He says things are worse there in California than over here.\" His livestock has always been his lifeline. Izquierdo used to have 140 goats, but he began selling off his livestock to make ends meet. A drought made feed more expensive, and now he's down to just 40 goats, with little money left for his medicine. \"I am sick and have been sick for quite some time.

When he visits his home in Mexico, he doesn't reveal everything about just how dire the situation is. \"Every time I go down there, a lot of people ask, 'How is my son doing?' \" Gutierrez said. \"I don't want to say they're out of a job or anything like that.\" He added, \"I say they're doing all right. But that is just a lie. They are doing bad right now. A lot of people are doing bad.\" He said he knows lots of legal U.S. residents who have moved back home to Tejaro or the state of Michoacan.

Zanetti celebrates his late strike as Inter retained their unbeaten Serie A record with a 1-1 draw against Roma. Roma captain Francesco Totti had given the visitors a deserved first-half leadbut Zanetti's strike two minutes from time maintained Inter's nine-point lead at the top. Roma needed to win to breathe new life into the title race but they were dealt a cruel blow as French defender Philippe Mexes was sent-off late on for two bookings in quick succession. Inter capitalised and they have now lost only once in their last 65 league matches. The home side had the first clear-cut chance of the match and were within centimeters of taking the lead when Hernan Crespo met a cross from Patrick Vieira with an acrobatic volley, but saw his effort cannon back off the post. The defending champions were made to pay for that miss on 38 minutes as the visitors orchestrated a sublime goal. Neat footwork from Macedonia international Mirko Vucinic released Max Tonetto down the left and his pin-point cross was flicked home at the near post by Totti from six meters out as he stole in front of defender Cristian Chivu. Inter center-back Nicolas Burdisso should have restored parity in first-half stoppage time but his header from Luis Figo's corner flew over the bar. Figo himself had a great chance on 54 minutes but after having time to set himself up for an attempted volley, he skewed his effort so badly that it did not even go out of play. After Mexes' dismissal 10 from time, Inter laid siege to Roma's goal. Goalkeeper Doni had to be alert to tip over Crespo's header three minutes from time but he could do nothing about Zanetti's volley a minute later. Meanwhile, AC Milan slipped to fifth place as they were held to a 1-1 draw at Catania. Brazilian teenager Pato gave them the lead early in the second half with a skimming long-range shot but substitute Gionathan Spinesi's header earnt the Sicilians a point.

Jean-Claude Darcheville scored two first-half goals as Rangers cruised to a 4-0 victory at Hearts. Hearts found themselves ripped apart by a rampant Rangers side, who sent out a clear message to rivals Celtic by maintaining their four-point advantage at the summit. Darcheville claimed the opener after 25 minutes, cutting inside from the left and squeezing his shot inside the far post from a tight angle. The same player added a second two minutes before the break, scoring from close range after a Barry Ferguson corner was not cleared. Darcheville was withdrawn for Novo at the interval, but if Hearts thought the departure of the Frenchman meant some much-needed respite, they were sadly mistaken. Novo was on the pitch for seven minutes when he helped himself to a goal of his own. Charlie Adam set up the shot with a low ball across goal and all that was required from the striker was to bundle home from close range. The same two players combined again to supply Rangers with their fourth goal with 69 minutes gone. Adam was again the provider and this time Novo produced a cheeky back-heel finish from five meters. Meanwhile, goals by Scott McDonald and Georgios Samaras gave Celtic a hard-fought 2-1 win at home to Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Australian international McDonald's 25th goal of the season right on the interval gave the champions the lead and his Greek team-mate bulleted an Aiden McGeady cross past goalkeeper Michael Fraser on the hour mark.

Rozita Swinton, 33, has been arrested in a case that is not directly related to the Texas raid. The telephone calls in late March prompted authorities to raid the Yearning For Zion (YFZ) Ranch in Eldorado, Texas, where 437 children were removed. The ranch is owned by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a Mormon offshoot that practices polygamy. Rozita Swinton, 33, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, was arrested this month on a charge of making a false report to police. The charge relates to an incident in February, but the Texas Rangers have said she is a person of interest in connection with the ranch calls. In the February incident, Swinton is accused of calling authorities using the names \"Dana Anderson\" and \"April,\" reporting abuse by male relatives, according to an affidavit in support of an arrest warrant. Authorities have not clearly said that they think Swinton made the March phone calls that prompted the raid. But the affidavit says she is \"known to make false reports of sexual abuse to the police and other agencies.\"  Watch how a hoax may be behind the ranch mystery \u00bb . Calls were made to a Texas family shelter March 29 and 30 from a female identifying herself as Sarah Barlow, the affidavit says. The caller said she was 16, had a baby about 8 months old and was pregnant again. She said that her 49-year-old husband was physically and sexually abusive toward her and that they were living at the YFZ Ranch. The phone calls were made from a prepaid cell phone with no available records, according to the affidavit. However, it has been used in other cases linked to Swinton, the document says. Although Texas officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls, they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch. The FLDS has denied that any abuse takes place at the ranch. The woman identifying herself as Sarah Barlow also called a battered women's shelter in Snohomish County, Washington, using another phone number, the affidavit says. That phone number was traced to Swinton's address, the affidavit says. On April 10, the woman called the Washington shelter again and was put on the line with a Texas deputy. She said she felt that she would be punished for the trouble she had caused, was worried that her baby might be taken away and was angry with a woman she had contacted March 29 for prompting the raid by law enforcement. During that conversation, the affidavit says, the woman used terminology common to the FLDS, referring to her \"sister wives,\" for instance. The phone number used in the Washington call was traced to the Colorado Springs apartment where Swinton lives, the affidavit says. The number was also used to call a Utah organization for women escaping polygamy and an abuse counseling center in Fort Myers, Florida, phone records showed. Swinton pleaded guilty to a charge of false reporting in June 2007 and was under a 12-month deferred sentence, the affidavit says. At a custody hearing last week, a Texas judge ruled that the state will temporarily retain custody of the 437 children removed in the raid. Meanwhile, on Tuesday evening, laboratory workers at San Angelo Coliseum completed taking DNA samples from mothers and children, said Janice Rolfe, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general's office. She did not say how many samples were taken. About 100 of the seized children from whom swab DNA samples had already been taken were bused Tuesday from the San Angelo Coliseum to group foster homes, the Texas Department of Health and Family Services said. On Wednesday, workers in Eldorado continued to take voluntary DNA samples from adults who live on the YFZ Ranch, Rolfe said. Rolfe said that at least 54 samples from adults have been taken there. The DNA samples will be sent to Laboratory Corporation of America, based in Burlington, North Carolina. It could take longer than a month to get results. Judge Barbara Walther, who last week ordered the DNA testing of the children and ordered that they remain in state custody, signed an order this week authorizing the children's move to foster care, officials said. At a meeting Wednesday afternoon, Walther and the state's Child Protective Services Division agreed that 18 mothers with breast-feeding babies that are 1 year old or younger will be allowed to stay with their children in the homes where the children are placed. Also, 23 mothers with 28 children ages 1 to 2 years will be allowed to stay in the same towns as their children. The remaining children, 2 to 18 years old, will be split up into available homes. The original order signed by Walther called for every effort to keep siblings together, especially in the case of small children. Rod Parker, a spokesman for the FLDS families, blasted the action in a news conference from his Salt Lake City, Utah, office. \"The CPS department of Texas is afraid of due process,\" he said. \"They would lose in a fair fight in this case, and that is why you're seeing them move so quickly, and that is why you're seeing them move unilaterally.\" He said the court ignored motions asking that the children be placed with their relatives. The FLDS launched a Web site this week to promote its side of the issue. The site, captivefldschildren.com, contains photos and videos taken inside the ranch during the raid. The site says donations are needed to help cover the \"massive litigation costs associated with these lawsuits.\" A link on the Web site allows online donations. E-mail to a friend .

Victor Manuel Mejia Munera was a drug lord with ties to paramilitary groups, the Colombian government says. Victor Manuel Mejia Munera and two bodyguards were killed Tuesday when police tracked them down on a farm in the northwestern province of Antioquia, according to a statement on the Colombian presidency Web site. Three people also were arrested, according to the statement. Mejia Munera was wearing an American-style, desert-camouflage uniform when he was killed, said Colombian Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos. Mejia Munera also had short- and long-range weapons with ammunition, the presidential statement said. \"This is a great strike of the Public Force against the criminal structures of the country,\" Santos said, warning that drug traffickers who do not turn themselves over to the government will \"end up in the jail or in a tomb.\" In terms of the country's most-wanted list, Mejia Munera was one of Colombia's most sought-after criminals and ranked just below the leaders of Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the statement said. The leftist guerilla group, which goes by its Spanish acronym FARC, holds about 750 hostages in the jungles of Colombia and has justified hostage-taking as a legitimate military tactic in a long-running civil war involving government forces, drug traffickers and right-wing paramilitaries. Mejia Munera is not alleged to have ties to FARC, but he had been involved with a right-wing paramilitary group known as United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, according to the U.S. State Department. Mejia Munera and his brother, Miguel Angel Mejia Munera, known as \"Los Mellizos,\" or \"the Twins,\" have been accused of running major drug rings in Colombia. The brothers also have faced narcotics-trafficking charges in the United States. Santos initially told reporters that police had killed Miguel Angel Mejia Munera. The Colombian presidency later said the slain drug lord was actually Victor Manuel Mejia Munera. Fingerprints confirmed that the dead man was Victor Mejia Munera, Colombian-based Caracol Radio reported. The brothers sometimes exchanged identities, the radio station said, and identity documents belonging to Miguel Mejia Munera were found near Victor Mejia Munera. In 2004, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia indicted the twins on narcotics-trafficking charges. The U.S. Justice Department at one point offered a $5 million reward for \"true and effective information\" on the whereabouts of a dozen suspects it wanted extradited to the United States. One of the 12 men wanted was Miguel Mejia Munera. The State Department said Wednesday there was no reward for Victor Mejia Munera. The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control reported that the brothers have been involved in narcotics trafficking since the early 1990s, when they were guarding ships carrying cocaine from western Colombia to Mexico. \"Over time,\" OFAC said in a news release last year, the brothers \"rose through the ranks to lead their own narcotics trafficking organization.\" \"Recent reports indicate that Los Mellizos may be funding their own illegal armed groups to facilitate their narcotics trafficking activities,\" the release said. The Colombian prosecutor general's office had indicted Victor Mejia Munera for his role in a 2004 paramilitary massacre of 11 farmers in Tame in the eastern Colombian province of Arauca, according to the State Department.

The Democrats' superdelegate system is supposed to avoid turmoil at the party's conventions. Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are running neck and neck toward the party's August convention in Denver, Colorado. Most projections show neither getting the necessary 2,025 delegates in the remaining nominating contests before then. Party rules call for the votes of superdelegates -- 800 or so party officers, elected officials and activists -- to tip the balance. The party instituted the system to avoid the turmoil that a deadlocked race would create at a convention. But even some superdelegates are questioning the system, as the party heads toward the conclusion of a race in which they might determine the outcome. \"It's not the most democratic way of doing things,\" said Maine superdelegate Sam Spencer.  Watch the scenario for a \"civil war\" in the Democratic Party \u00bb . At least two organizations have launched petition drives to reflect how the vote went in primaries and caucuses. MoveOn.org, which has endorsed Obama, is trying to get 200,000 signatures this week and plans to run an ad with its petition in USA Today. And Democracy for America, headed by Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean's brother Jim, said it will deliver signed petitions to all the superdelegates. While pledged delegates are allocated with the understanding they'll vote the way their state went in its primary or caucus, superdelegates are free to vote however they want. And even if they pledge their support to a candidate, they're free to change at any time. Clinton already has 234 superdelegates and Obama has 157. But Obama has a sizable lead in pledged delegates, 1,096 to 977, and is on a roll, having won all eight nominating contests since Super Tuesday.  See which states pledged delegates come from \u00bb . If the superdelegates were to tip the balance against the popular vote, the turmoil would last long beyond the convention, longtime Democratic Party strategist Tad Devine said. \"If a perception develops that somehow this decision has been made not by voters participating in primaries or caucuses, but by politicians in some mythical backroom, I think that the public could react strongly against that,\" Devine said. \"The problem is [if] people perceive that voters have not made the decision -- instead, insiders have made the decision -- then all of these new people who are being attracted to the process, particularly the young people who are voting for the first time, will feel disenfranchised or in some way alienated,\" he said. Superdelegates were established in 1982 to bring more moderate Democrats back to conventions, where their attendance had been dropping since the 1950s, and to relect the party's mainstream more accurately. \"[Superdelegates] are the keepers of the faith,\" said former San Francisco, California, Mayor Willie Brown. \"You have superdelegates because this is the Democratic Party. You don't want the bleed-over from the Green Party, the independents and others in deciding who your nominee will be.\" Devine was part of the first campaign to benefit from the roles of superdelegates -- that of former Vice President Walter Mondale in 1984. Mondale's 1984 campaign went into the party convention with too few delegates to secure the nomination against the campaigns of former Sen. Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson. Mondale had received more votes, but Hart had won more states. Mondale was able to line up the superdelegates going into the convention and avoid a fight on the convention floor. Each campaign actively is trying to encourage the unpledged delegates to pledge to their side. Jason Rae, a 21-year-old Wisconsin superdelegate, said he's gotten calls from former President Clinton and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright from Hillary Clinton's camp, and Obama's wife, Michelle, visited with him during a campaign stop Tuesday in Wisconsin. Rae said he hasn't yet decided how he'll vote in Wisconsin's primary on Tuesday. Crystal Strait, a party activist from California, said she's received calls from Clinton herself and daughter Chelsea but she remains uncommitted. Massachusetts superdelegate John Walsh said he'll stay loyal to Obama despite the fact that the senator lost the primary in Walsh's state. So will fellow Massachusetts superdelegates Sens. Edward Kennedy and John Kerry. Among Clinton's committed superdelegates are Harold Ickes Jr., her husband's former deputy chief of staff; Terry McAuliffe, who led her husband's 1996 re-election campaign and is chairman of her campaign; and her husband. Whether those superdelegates stay committed to their candidates, even if it means tipping the outcome of the race against the pledged delegate lead or the popular vote, could split the party. \"It's in a total contradiction of the way the Democrats have set up their primary process, with all this proportional representation,\" said CNN political analyst Amy Holmes. \"The whole point of it was that no one could walk away with the elites. And if this is decided by superdelegates, I think the Democratic Party morally is going to be looking at each other and say, 'What did we just do?' \" Devine said it could hurt the party in the general election. \"I think it will hurt us particularly because so many of the policies that we're saying we will pursue in government as Democrats are based on fairness, whether it's the tax policies that we advocate or the social programs we want to advance, there's a fairness component in all of that,\" he said. \"People need to believe, I think, that our process is fair as well, if they want to believe that our policies will be fair.\" E-mail to a friend .

The terrifying sound marked the beginning of a two-year nightmare for Sarah Teres as she desperately tried to potty train her daughter Molly. Molly graduated from Potty School four days before her brother, Archer, was born. \"It was awful\" Teres said. \"We tried everything including bribery and threats.\" Teres, the mother of three from Andover, Massachusetts, hoped her middle child would be toilet trained by the time she was 2\u00bd. Two years later, the girl was still in diapers, refusing to use the bathroom. \"I was going crazy,\" Teres admitted. \"She wouldn't poop. She would hold it for days.\" At wits end, Teres enrolled Molly in the Toilet Training School at Children's Hospital Boston. \"By the time the children come in with their families, it has become a power struggle,\" explained Dr. Alison Schonwald, a pediatrician who supervises the \"poop school,\" as it's affectionately called by staffers. \"The kids kind of dig in their heels and put a line in the sand.\"  Health Minute: Watch more on the perils of potty training \u00bb . The American Academy of Pediatrics reports that most children show signs they're ready to potty train between 18 and 24 months. Doctors suggest a child may be ready to start trying if he's staying dry for at least two hours at a time during the day, walking to and from the bathroom, asking for a diaper change and asking to use the potty. For some kids, the toilet training process can take more than a year, or longer. The six-week program at Children's Hospital is one of a handful around the country. Kimberly Dunn, a pediatric nurse practitioner, has worked with some of the 450 young graduates over the years. She said most of the kids admit they are afraid to use a toilet. \"Oftentimes, the parents come in and they want to know why they're afraid,\" Dunn said. \"You could ask the kids until they're blue in the face and you hardly ever find out why.\" Dunn meets with a half-dozen children once a week. She uses books, music and art to help the students overcome their fear of using the toilet. She helps them set small, realistic goals. For instance, she said, week one involved just sitting on the toilet for five minutes. She encourages positive reinforcement and simple rewards such as extra playtime with Mom or Dad. While Dunn works on the kids, psychologist Elaine Leclair, an instructor at the Harvard School of Medicine, offers frank advice to the parents in a separate room. \"I just say, 'Step back.' They hate to hear me say this, but I say whatever you're doing now is not working. You really need to try something different,\" Leclair said. She said many parents come to the sessions angry and anxious. \"They come in feeling extremely discouraged, very isolated thinking they are the only ones in the world who have this problem.\" Teres acknowledged that's how she felt. \"Imagine my surprise to find out there were thousands of kids who had this problem.\" After years of hiding her daughter's toilet training troubles from family and friends, the group parenting sessions allowed Teres to open up about her frustrations. \"It was like going to Betty Ford,\" joked Teres, who felt she had exhausted all her other options. A majority of the children who attend the Children's Hospital class are dealing with constipation issues often caused by delayed toilet training. Teres learned that her daughter had a medical condition called encopresis. Experts call it a symptom of chronic constipation and say it occurs when a child resists having a bowel movement. Youngsters like Molly are sometimes given laxatives or other medications to help encourage them to go. Schonwald, the author of \"The Pocket Idiot's Guide to Potty Training,\" doesn't want parents to be discouraged during the process. \"No one goes to college in diapers, right? Everyone will get through this time, as awful as it might feel if you're struggling.\" She suggested achieving success during potty training has to do with the approach. \"There are three things you cannot make a child do: eat, sleep or poop. We find that by decreasing the pressure and expectations that children feel more confident.\" Schonwald reminds parents that toilet training \"is not a chore, so keeping it positive from the very beginning is the most important thing.\" If a child isn't using the toilet by the age of 4, she recommends talking with a pediatrician. Schonwald also said setbacks during potty training are normal. \"All developmental skills come in spurts with periods of regression.\" After a setback, Schonwald advises parents to give their child positive messages that they can succeed by saying, \"So you had some accidents today. We'll try again tomorrow.\" Four months after graduating from \"poop school,\" Teres is relieved to report that Molly is fully toilet trained. \"You would never know this was an issue,\" said Teres. \"She even used an automatic flush toilet the other day. I waited to see her reaction and she was OK.\" E-mail to a friend . Judy Fortin is a correspondent with CNN Medical News.

The answer could come this weekend when video game enthusiasts find out whether \"Grand Theft Auto IV,\" expected to set sales records in the gaming world this week, will steal glory and revenue from a different entertainment empire: the movies. As the hype for \"GTA IV\" continues to grow and reviews scream perfection, some speculate that the game will put a dent in Marvel Studios' opening weekend box office for \"Iron Man.\" \"GTA IV\" is the ninth incarnation of a video game in which the user acts as a criminal roaming a city. The series has faced criticism for being too violent, because users are allowed to beat, stab, shoot and kill citizens and police officers. \"Iron Man\" is a movie based on the Marvel comic book superhero who creates an impressive suit of armor to save his life and help save the world. \"GTA IV\" was released Tuesday at midnight and is expected to gross about $400 million in the first week.  See what makes this violent game so popular \u00bb . Edward Woo, a research analyst specializing in media and interactive entertainment at Wedbush Morgan Securities, said the game's release date and widespread reach could negatively affect opening box office numbers for \"Iron Man.\" \"People on Friday or Saturday might find themselves at home playing this game instead of at the Cineplex,\" Woo said. \" 'Iron Man' will still have a pretty good release, but intuitively, I think it's got be impacted when both share a similar audience and genre.\" Because of the time element the game requires of its faithful -- between 30 and 40 hours to finish depending on skill level -- the question is whether gamers will put down their controllers for a couple of hours and go for a change of scenery. Paramount Vice Chairman Rob Moore said he isn't worried.    \"It's crazy to think that young males can't carve out two hours for 'Iron Man,' \" he told EW.com. \"It's going to be a great week to be a young guy.\"  Watch why violence in the game concerns some people \u00bb . This weekend won't be the first time analysts have speculated about video games damaging box office numbers. Last year, with $170 million in launch day sales and $300 million in its first week, \"Halo 3\" was blamed by some for the poor box office performance of \"The Heartbreak Kid,\" starring Ben Stiller.  Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of \"GTA IV\" publisher Rockstar Games, predicted that with 6 million preorders worldwide, the game will bring in more than $400 million. \"GTA IV\" has a chance of surpassing the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" as the highest-grossing entertainment title in its first week of sales, and that's across all genres. Electronic Arts CEO John Riccitiello told the Financial Times this month that movie executives told him, \" 'Iron Man' the movie is going to get killed by 'Grand Theft Auto,' the game. \"I don't think I've ever heard of that before,\" he said. The video game market is growing at a rate of 20 to 30 percent this year, but the movie industry isn't seeing as much of an increase, Woo said. Overall, video game sales as a whole have eclipsed box office sales, he said, but the movie industry catches up when it comes to DVDs. Ebullient reviews touted the game as \"The Godfather\" of video games because of its cult-like following. Andrew Reiner, who reviewed \"GTA IV\" for Game Informer, a well-known destination for all things gaming, scored it as a 10.0/10.0 under the title of \"Perfection.\" \"I now know how film critics felt after screening 'The Godfather,' \" his review began. \"GTA IV\" is a \"landscape-changing event that doesn't come around very often,\" Reiner said. It seems the feelings have translated to the regular consumer too. Gamers from Norway to Britain to America echoed similar sentiments on gaming message boards. D.J. Brotherson from Winnipeg, Canada, said he enjoyed the game so much, he wanted to skip work and keep playing all night, saying it was unlike any game he had ever played. \"The story line is very well-written,\" he said, adding that the game \"plays like an interactive Martin Scorsese movie.\" \"Today, I was as excited as I was when I was 5 years old and I just got my first Nintendo Entertainment System on Christmas Day.\" E-mail to a friend .", "62f05476ec5198ceb345ce4f45d7d0e70f499ad7": "(CNN) -- A former police officer convicted of murdering his girlfriend and their unborn child tearfully apologized to her family Monday in front of the jury that will decide whether he lives or dies.

Jones, was the first witness called to the stand by the defense. She said her son was a good youngster who was active in sports, Scouts and his church. \"I never had any trouble out of him,\" she said as Cutts teared up at the defense table.

He blamed himself for the break up of his marriage, saying his drinking and gambling contributed to it. Cutts' own personal life was rocky, according to testimony. Davis was nine months pregnant when she disappeared in June 2007. Her body was found in a northeastern Ohio park after a 10-day search that brought national media attention . He is Blake's father, as well as the father of the unborn girl, Chloe. According to testimony, Cutts, 30, rolled Davis' body in a comforter and dumped it in a park, leaving  toddler son Blake in the house alone at the crime scene in a soiled diaper. \"Mommy's in the rug,\" Blake told police, according to testimony. During the guilt phase of the trial, Cutts sobbed on the witness stand as he admitted killing Davis and Chloe. But Cutts insisted that their deaths were an accident. \"I didn't mean to hurt her,\" Cutts testified, clasping a handful of tissues. \"This isn't real,\" he said he kept telling himself. Prosecutors discounted Cutts' story, claiming he buckled under the financial pressure of child support, killed the mother of his child and then created a cover story to try to get away with it. On the stand, Cutts said he went to pick up his son, Blake, and became agitated when Davis, 26, wasn't moving fast enough to get the boy ready. He said he tried to leave her house, but she grabbed him to keep him from leaving, and he accidentally elbowed her in the throat. Cutts told the jury he performed CPR on Davis and then tried to revive her with bleach. When he realized Davis was dead, Cutts said he panicked and put her in the back of his truck, so Blake wouldn't have to see his mother.

Australian citizen Benjamin Potts and British citizen Giles Lane, both members of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, jumped on board the Yushin Maru No. 2 Tuesday to deliver a letter saying the vessel was violating international law and Australian law by killing whales. The anti-whaling group accused the crew of the Japanese vessel of kidnapping the men based on a video that showed Potts and Lane tied to the ship's railing. In the video, Japanese fishermen pace back and forth in front of them. Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith Wednesday did not answer questions about whether the men would be charged for their actions, stressing instead that the immediate priority was to retrieve them. \"I'm not going to give a running commentary on who's done what to whom and the various allegations and counter allegation,\" he said. Smith said the Japanese government -- which formally approached Australia to assist in the transfer -- did not lay out any conditions for the transfer, in which the men were brought on board the Australian ship, the Oceanic Viking.  Watch the anti-whaling activists board the Japanese vessel \u00bb . Capt. Paul Watson, founder of Sea Shepherd, had said earlier that the men were seized by the Japanese crew and assaulted.

Sea Shepherd claims Japan's Institute for Cetacean Research, which is backing the operations, had said it would release the two activists if Sea Shepherd agrees to stop interfering in its whaling operations. The group says it will not agree to that demand. The Japanese Fisheries Agency said Thursday it would readily hand over the two men. But the agency charged that the Sea Shepherd members were the terrorists. At a news conference earlier, the agency released pictures of broken bottles they claim group members threw at the ship. They also released a photo of the two activists relaxing and drinking tea aboard the Yushin Maru. \"For some time, for 10, 15 minutes, I understand, they were tied to a GPS mast,\" Tomohiko Taniguchi of Japan's Foreign Ministry told CNN. \"The Japanese crew members feared that two crew members from Sea Shepherd might do something violent.\" He said Potts and Lane boarded the vessel without permission. Watson said the two boarded only after attempts to contact the ship by radio were unsuccessful. Japan has been hunting whales in the Antarctic and apparently plans to kill as many as 1,000 this winter. The killings are allowed under international law because their main purpose is scientific. \"We regard them as poachers,\" Watson said. E-mail to a friend .

David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, has been chosen to become chief of U.S. Central Command, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Wednesday. Gen. David Petraeus has been the commander in Iraq for more than a year. Petraeus would replace Adm. William Fallon, who said last month that he was resigning. Fallon said widespread, but false, reports that he was at odds with the Bush administration over Iran had made his job impossible. In addition, Gates said, Army Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno, commander of the Multinational Corps-Iraq -- the No. 2 position in Iraq -- is being nominated to fill Petraeus' post. Odierno has been home from Iraq for only a couple of months but has agreed to return, Gates said. The plan is for Petraeus to leave Iraq in late summer or early fall, Gates said, to ensure a smooth transition and plenty of time for Odierno to prepare. \"We expect to move the paperwork on these nominations to the White House and to the Senate very quickly,\" Gates said. \"Because of the complexity of this series of moves, I respectfully ask the Senate to move on them expeditiously, hopefully by Memorial Day, so the families and we can plan appropriately.\" Odierno was in line for a Pentagon desk job as Army Vice Chief just over a year after helping Petraeus implement the \"surge\" in U.S. troops in Iraq. The Pentagon says Petraeus will stay in Iraq long enough to make the first recommendation on further troop cuts after the surge is over.  Watch the challenges ahead of Petraeus \u00bb . Gates said the generals' promotions reflected an endorsement of the current course in Iraq. \"The course certainly that Gen. Petraeus has set has been a successful course. So, frankly, I think staying that course is not a bad idea. I would say it's a good idea,\" Gates said.  Watch Gates nominate Petraeus \u00bb . Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in East Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, has its headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida. Gates said Odierno is well known to troops in Iraq, to military leadership and to Iraqis, and \"I believe, in most parts of the world, especially in the Middle East, personal relationships make a difference.\" \"I believe that this arrangement will probably preserve the likelihood of continued momentum and progress,\" Gates said. The defense secretary said he expects to easily win Senate approval for the nominations once they are made by President Bush. He said he had spoken with Sens. Carl Levin, D-Michigan; John McCain, R-Arizona; and John Warner, R-Virginia, and \"I don't really anticipate any problems.\" In a press release Wednesday, McCain praised the move. \"Both of these great generals have served our country with skill and distinction, and I am pleased that they will continue to do so in positions of high responsibility,\" McCain wrote. Gates acknowledged that Fallon's \"decision to step down was unexpected.\" \"I had intended that Adm. Fallon probably stay on for a third year. His second year would have ended in February,\" he said. \"So I'm faced with a critical combatant command where a commander is needed -- and a commander who knows what's going on in the region.\" Asked whether he was using Petraeus \"almost as a finger in the dike\" because of the shortage of Army generals with expertise in counterinsurgency warfare, Gates admitted that there are few Army officers with experience in and knowledge of Iraq. Odierno served as commander of the 4th Infantry Division, the unit that captured former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Petraeus was picked in January 2007 to replace Gen. George Casey as the chief commander in Iraq and won Senate confirmation that month. He previously served as head of the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center and as a commander in Iraq, and he was one of the main writers of an Army manual on counterinsurgency efforts. He was seen as the logical choice to replace Fallon. In his new post, he will oversee U.S. forces in all the Middle East, not only Iraq and Afghanistan. \"I recommended him to the president because I am absolutely confident he is the best man for the job,\" Gates said. In testimony to Congress this month, Petraeus said Iranian agents have played a \"destructive role\" in Iraq by backing Shiite militants, called \"special groups\" by the United States. The U.S. believes that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force is behind the support for militants. \"Unchecked, the special groups pose the greatest long-term threat to the viability of a democratic Iraq,\" Petraeus testified. Last month, in an interview with CNN's Kyra Phillips in Baghdad, Petraeus acknowledged some \"friction\" between himself and Fallon in the past year, but \"actually, over the last six months or so, our relationship was really very, very good.\" \"There was friction in the beginning. He has a different job than I have,\" Petraeus said. \"There can be understandable differences of your take, if you will, on a situation. As they say in politics and government 101, where you stand on an issue sometimes depends on where you sit in the organization, and we sit in different chairs.\" E-mail to a friend .

Now, you have a friend in the greeting card business. Terrye Cheathem has created a line of greeting cards geared toward prison inmates. A Los Angeles, California, lawyer has come up with a series of cards geared toward prison inmates, a rapidly growing segment of the U.S. population. Some express simple good wishes: \"We are all praying for you while you do your time.\" Others celebrate holidays: \"You had the choice to be 'naughty or nice.' And you chose ... Now you have to do your time. But, Christmas won't be the same without you here.\" Others dole out tough love: \"When you called last time, I was not very sympathetic. I guess that I have heard your promises to change too many times. Please - stop promising to change. Just do it.\" Creator Terrye Cheathem said the cards let family members say \"Look, things need to be different when you get out.\" She came up with the idea a few years ago while looking -- without success -- for a birthday card to send her brother-in-law, who was serving an 11-month sentence. \"There are so many people who have mixed feelings about communicating with their loved ones in prison,\" Cheathem said Thursday. \"They are unhappy, oftentimes profoundly embarrassed. People don't know what to say.\" So she created Three Squares Greetings to capture the sentiments for a captive audience -- one that seems to be getting larger each year. More than 2.3 million people were in jails or prisons in the United States at the beginning of 2008, according to a study released last month by the Pew Center on the States. The center is a private organization that advocates for alternative programs to alleviate prison populations. For the first time in the nation's history, the center says, more than one in 100 Americans are behind bars, a higher proportion than any other country. Cheathem is selling her cards online and through stores. She also wants jails and prisons to carry cards designed for inmates to send their relatives. \"They're 'Thank You' cards,\" she said. \" 'Thank you for visiting,' 'Thank you for bringing the kids,' 'Thank you for coming to court.' \" Like many, bookstore owner James Fugate was at first reluctant to carry the line in his Los Angeles shop, Esowon Books. \"I have some issues of being nice to criminals,\" Fugate said. \"And in my 20 years in business, I've seen some relatives who don't seem to realize the gravity of what (their family members) have done.\" Fugate said he changed his mind when he realized that most of the cards carried messages asking inmates to turn their lives around. Cheathem understands the hesitation of shoppers and sellers. \"I can't think of any other product that anyone wants to receive and certainly no one wants to be in the position to buy one,\" she said. \"But there is a need for this.\" Cheathem points to Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick of Detroit, Michigan. He was charged this week with perjury, obstruction of justice and misconduct of office. He was released on a $75,000 bond. \"I have a card that says, 'I'm sorry to hear about your arrest,' \" she said. \"Right now , there are probably 50 people or more who would send it to him.\"  E-mail to a friend .", "6f6964470c122807573653173b45b8e00bb59696": "(CNN) -- Some people might call 17-year-old Joshua Hanson one the luckiest people on the planet.

We asked other CNN.com readers for their take on \"Halo 3.\" Some offered comparisons to \"Star Wars\" and \"Harry Potter,\" while others discussed compelling new graphics and features. Below is a selection of their responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. Curt Otto of Springfield, Virginia I waited in line for two-and-half hours to get this game at midnight. I purchased the Legendary Edition of this game at a hefty $130! Totally worth it! Although I haven't slept since yesterday and I'm currently at work and very tired, I would do it all over again for \"Halo.\" This is the GREATEST game ever crafted by the hand of man. If you own a 360, buy this game. If you don't own a 360, buy one and go buy this game! The single player is incredible and the online multiplayer is MIND BLOWING! Totally worth $130!!! Tony Nash of Buffalo, New York  I've been playing \"Halo\" since the very first game came out in 2001. After getting the brand new Box with a copy of \"Halo\" and throwing myself into the game, I quickly realized this wasn't a standard gaming experience. It was something much, much more. The game had a great attitude and unique art style. Along with great audio and environments that brought the worlds to life. It also had the most addictive, natural, and fun game play I've ever experienced. It also contained a well written, downright intriguing story. Getting together with friends to play the multiplayer portion of the game only cemented this title's epic status. Then came November 2004, when, of course, a friend and I were in the lines for the Midnight release of \"Halo 2.\" It is no joke; \"Halo\" is more than just a game. Now, I plan on \"finishing the fight\" as soon as I leave work. I had \"Halo 3\" pre-ordered for about a month before it came out. Hey, after all, it's good to keep the kid inside you alive and well! Cody Chmelik of Clearwater, Florida  \"Halo 3\" is the most anticipated event since the trial of O.J., but the only difference is that \"Halo\" isn't disappointing. \"Halo 3\" was the best game I have ever played. The levels are choreographed perfectly, the players look real and the game play is phenomenal. I recommend this game to players of all ages. Wayne S. of Colorado Springs, Colorado  \"Halo\" is not just a game, it's a lifestyle, a booming culture of millions of Xbox fans who eat, sleep and live \"Halo.\" \"Halo\" has jumped started the major league gaming industry and will continue to do so with \"Halo 3.\" I will be getting my copy of \"Halo 3\" at midnight and plan on playing it for days straight. I have played the beta and let me tell you: This is the best video game of the year by far and will be played by the masses for years to come just like \"Halo 2.\" Brian Baker of Beatrice, Nebraska I am 30 years old, and for my 30th birthday my wife pre-ordered \"Halo 3\" for me as a birthday present. The 6 month wait for the present/game didn't bother me one bit. The story that is \"Halo\" is something that people can easily identify with. The late '70s to late '90s had Luke Skywalker and the alpha-male heroes of \"Star Wars.\" The Generation X, Y and Z now have an alpha-male hero of their own in the Master Chief that they can relate to, or use to associate different attitudes and help instill values of patriotism. In this case, patriotism is not for just a country, but an entire planet and species. I am a very patriotic person, a veteran and a father and see the values that may hide below the surface in this Trilogy, which is why I'm a \"Halo\" fan. Jarrod Leda of Tarentum, Pennsylvania  Despite the hype, I am very excited for this [new game]. Some question why \"Halo\" got so big, as there are other good shooters very similar to it. I think, like \"Star Wars\" before it, it just got things right. And now, it's become iconic: the characters, the universe, it's something everyone who loves games can talk about and share. The game allows things that most other games would not; the physics and mechanics of the engine are great. And it plays flawlessly on X-box live. I can't wait. Vivek Patel of Albany, New York  \"Halo\" can be compared to \"Harry Potter\" in that when you start reading or playing you have to finish. The third installment gamers will wait in line for hours; even bleed to finally finish the fight that was started years ago. To me \"Halo 3\" isn't even advertised that much, and they will achieve their records by sheer popularity. Alessandro Miglio of Walnut Creek, California  The \"Halo\" franchise is like a budding \"Star Trek\" phenomenon. There are a lot of hardcore fans, like myself, who are not just really into the games, but read all the books and comics that expand the universe. We even write tons of theories and fan fictions with all the potential created by the \"Haloverse.\" I consider myself a \"Trekkie\" of \"Halo,\" loud and proud.

The grim record came despite lower death rates in recent months, which were not enough to offset death tolls that topped 100 during three months in the spring. Four soldiers were killed when a roadside bomb exploded near their vehicle in northern Iraq's Tameem province; another died in combat in Anbar province. A sailor was killed in Salaheddin province \"as a result of injuries sustained from an explosion while conducting operations,\" the military said. According to a CNN count of Pentagon figures, 853 U.S. service members have died so far in 2007. The next highest death toll was in 2004, when 849 were killed. The total number of U.S. military deaths in Iraq stands at 3,856, including seven civilian contractors of the Defense Department. The high number of deaths this year corresponds with the U.S. troop buildup called the \"surge\" and a crackdown on insurgents in and near Baghdad. Monthly death tolls were highest in the first part of the year: 83 deaths in January, 81 in February and 81 in March. Numbers peaked in the next three months, with 104 deaths in April, 126 in May and 101 in June. The numbers have dropped from that level since -- with 78 in July, 84 in August, 65 in September, 38 in October and 12 so far in November. Civilian deaths have also dropped in recent months, U.S. and Iraqi authorities say. The Iraq war began in March of 2003 and in that year there were 486 U.S. military deaths. In 2004, major offensives were responsible for many fatalities, including the massive operation in Falluja in November and fighting between U.S. troops and Shiite militants in Najaf. The number of deaths in 2005 was 846 and in 2006 it was 822. The U.S. military also announced on Tuesday that it intends to release nine detained Iranians in Iraq \"in the coming days,\" a move that dovetails with the American hope that Iranian authorities are honoring a recent pledge to stop Iranian help to insurgents in Iraq. \"These individuals have been assessed to have no continuing value\" and don't pose a \"further threat\" to Iraqi security, said Rear Adm. Gregory Smith. Two of them are from the \"Irbil 5\" detained in January. Irbil is the largest city in the Kurdish area of Iraq. The U.S. military had accused the five Iranians arrested in Irbil of having links to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard-Quds Force, a military unit accused of aiding insurgent activity -- including the distribution of roadside bombs. Smith said Tuesday that materials for roadside bombs \"do not appear to have arrived into Iraq after the Iranians have made their pledge to stop arming, funding and training extremists.\" \"We hope in the coming weeks and months to confirm that Iran has indeed honored its pledge through further verification that the flow of ammunitions and other lethal aid has indeed stopped,\" said Smith, who noted that Iran, Iraq and the United States plan to hold another round of security talks. Last month, Gen. David Petraeus, the top-ranking U.S. military official in Iraq, told CNN the Iranian ambassador had given assurances to his Iraqi counterpart that such training and supplying of insurgents would end. Meanwhile, a Kurdistan Regional Government official on Tuesday confirmed to CNN that two Iranian consulates had been established in the region, offices created in the wake of the arrests in Irbil. At the time of the arrests, Iran insisted the arrested officials were \"diplomats\" working in a diplomatic mission, while Iraq's Foreign Ministry and the U.S. military said it was a \"liaison\" office which did not have diplomatic status. One of the new consulates is in a building in Irbil that had been closed down during the January raid, the Kurdistan official said. Also Tuesday, the U.S. military reported that U.S. and Iraqi troops found 22 corpses buried in Iraq's Lake Tharthar region. The Iraqi Army and local security forces \"are investigating the mass grave to determine the identities of the deceased and the causes of death for notification of their families,\" the military said. Lake Tharthar is in both Anbar and Salaheddin provinces and northwest of Baghdad. U.S. and Iraqi troops have been conducting an operation in the same region since Sunday to target al Qaeda in Iraq. So far, they have found and destroyed two car bomb facilities and a number of weapons caches and detained 30 men. The military also said that coalition troops on Tuesday killed eight people described as terrorists and detained 10 suspects in operations targeting al Qaeda and foreign militant networks in central and northern Iraq. The military also said an operation involving Iraqi forces in the Tikrit area on October 30 led to the detention of 39 \"suspected insurgents\" and the discovery of a torture cell, a mobile hospital, car bombs, rocket-propelled grenades, machine guns and a Katyusha rocket.

Courtney Larrell Lockhart, 23, of Smiths, Alabama, is charged with capital murder during a kidnapping, capital murder during a robbery, and capital murder during an attempted rape, Tommy Dawson said Saturday. The Phenix City Police Department took Lockhart into custody on Friday, police said. Phenix City is about 35 miles southeast of Auburn. Burk, 18, from Marietta, Georgia, was found shot on North College Street, a few miles north of campus, on Tuesday night. She died later at a hospital. Minutes after police responded to the call reporting an injured person and found Burk, they found a car -- which turned out to be Burk's -- on fire in a campus parking lot. Dawson told reporters Friday that authorities think gasoline or another accelerant was used to ignite Burk's car, and police were investigating whether a gas can found in downtown Auburn was connected. Police want to investigate every possible lead, Dawson said. Authorities were still on patrol in the east Alabama campus, he said. The university's Web site said a campus-wide memorial service will be held Monday. The site carried a message from Burk's father, James, which said: \"The Burk family was so proud to have Lauren as an Auburn University student. We want to extend our deepest gratitude and appreciation for Auburn University, the city of Auburn and the Auburn Police Department. We feel very close to your community. We appreciate what everyone is doing for us and Lauren.\" Also on Friday, police released pictures of a 2001 Honda Civic similar to Burk's car. Authorities asked anyone who thinks they might have seen the car on Tuesday to contact them. Police are continuing to interview people, Dawson said.

The inside of one of the vaults at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, on a remote island near the Arctic Ocean. Dubbed the \"Doomsday Vault,\" the seed bank on a remote island near the Arctic Ocean is considered the ultimate safety net for the world's seed collections, protecting them from a wide range of threats including war, natural disasters, lack of funding or simply poor agricultural management. Norwegian musicians performed Tuesday as part of an elaborate opening ceremony marking the opening of the vault, located 130 meters (427 feet) inside a frozen mountain. Wangari Maathai, a Kenyan environmental and political activist who won the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize, placed the first seeds inside the vault, followed by other dignitaries. The inaugural shipment represent 268,000 distinct samples of seeds, with each sample containing a hundred-plus seeds and originating from a different farm or field around the world. In all, the shipment of seeds secured in the vault Tuesday weighed approximately 10 tons, filling 676 boxes. The shipment amounts to a 100 million seeds in total, ranging from major African and Asian food staples like maize, rice, and wheat to European and South American varieties of eggplant, lettuce, barley, and potato, according to the Global Crop Diversity Trust, which is paying to collect and maintain the seeds.

The Norwegian government paid to build the vault in a mountainside near Longyearbyen, in the remote Svalbard islands between Norway and the North Pole. Building began last year. The United Nations founded the trust in 2004 to support the long-term conservation of crop diversity, and countries and foundations provide the funding. \"The seed vault is the perfect place for keeping seeds safe for centuries,\" said Cary Fowler, executive director of the trust. \"At these temperatures, seeds for important crops like wheat, barley and peas can last for up to 10,000 years.\" The vault's location deep inside a mountain in the frozen north ensures the seeds can be stored safely no matter what happens outside. \"We believe the design of the facility will ensure that the seeds will stay well-preserved even if such forces as global warming raise temperatures outside the facility,\" said Magnus Bredeli Tveiten, project manager for the Norwegian government. The vault sits at the end of a 120-meter (131-yard) tunnel blasted inside the mountain. Workers used a refrigeration system to bring the vault to -18 degrees Celsius (just below 0 degrees Fahrenheit), and a smaller refrigeration system plus the area's natural permafrost and the mountain's thick rock will keep the vault at at least -4 C (25 F). The vault at Svalbard is similar to an existing seed bank in Sussex, England, about an hour outside London. The British vault, called the Millennium Seed Bank, is part of an scientific project that works with wild plants, as opposed to the seeds of crops. Paul Smith, the leader of the Millennium Seed Bank project, said preserving the seeds of wild plants is just as important as preserving the seeds of vital crops. \"We must give ourselves every option in the future to use the whole array of plant diversity that is available to us,\" Smith told CNN. The idea for the Arctic seed bank dates to the 1980s but only became a possibility after the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources came into force in 2004, the Norwegian government said. The treaty provided an international framework for conserving and accessing crop diversity. Svalbard is designed to store duplicates of seeds from seed collections around the world. The Norwegian government says it has paid 50 million Norwegian Kroner ($9.4 million) to build the seed vault. E-mail to a friend .

Students protest against a racist video on the campus of Free State University in Bloemfontein, South Africa. The white students made a video of the incident, which they staged in reaction to the university's efforts to integrate its residences, according to a statement from the University of the Free State. The protesters on Wednesday included black and white students who later marched to the residence where the video was made and demanded that it be shut down, witnesses said. The video surfaced on Tuesday but was made in September, the university said. In the video, white male students at Reitz Residence are seen encouraging at least three black female housekeepers to participate in what the students call the \"Reitz Fear Factor,\" an apparent reference to the television show in which contestants eat live worms or compete in other feats.  Watch excerpts of video that sparked outrage \u00bb . In one scene from the video, a student mixes what looks like a beef stew in a plastic bowl and adds garlic and other items. Then he tells the camera he will add the \"special ingredient.\" The student then urinates into the mixture, which he later stirs up and puts in a microwave. Other students can be heard laughing on the tape. The next scene shows a different student urging at least three housekeepers to drink cups full of the stew, saying, \"This is our dorm's 'Fear Factor.' We want to see who has the best 'Fear Factor.'\" On the video, the student does not tell the women that there is urine in the mixture. The women, on their knees, spit the stew into buckets after tasting it. Some appeared to vomit, but the women also laughed during the incident as the student urged them on. Next, the women struggle to run in what appears to be a race. The video is put in slow-motion as the theme from \"Chariots of Fire\" plays. Finally, one of the students awards a large bottle of whiskey to one of the women, telling her she has won the \"Fear Factor.\" At the end of the video, a message appears on the screen in Afrikaans saying, \"That, at the end of the day, is what we think of integration.\" University officials and human rights groups in South Africa denounced the video. \"The executive management of the [university] condemns this video in the strongest possible terms as a gross violation of the human dignity of the workers involved,\" said UFS Rector Frederick Fourie in a statement posted on the university's Web site. \"We have immediately started with a most urgent investigation into this matter,\" he added. Later Wednesday, Fourie met with the employees seen in the video and apologized to them, a statement from the university said. Counseling is being provided for the workers, it added. The students involved in the video have been identified and will be suspended, Fourie said, and charges against the men will be filed with the South African Police Service. Two of the students in the video are still enrolled at the university but had been barred from the campus in Bloemfontein, according to the university. Two others completed their studies last year. The students seen in the video have not made any public comment since the video surfaced. \"I am deeply saddened that students apparently see nothing wrong in producing such an offensive and degrading video. I have publicly said several times that the UFS is not a place for racism,\" the rector's statement said. \"The fact that it is openly linked to the integration process in UFS residences is also most disturbing,\" Fourie said. A spokeswoman in Free State province for the Democratic Alliance -- an opposition party which says it puts equal rights for all South Africans at the center of its policies -- called the video \"shocking and inhumane.\" \"It looked like they were willing [participants] but they didn't know what purpose the video served. ... It was quite humiliating at the end to see the quite senior ladies on their knees eating the meat,\" said spokeswoman Liana Van Wyk, the South African Press Association reported. Helen Zille, the Democratic Alliance's leader, Wednesday asked the South African Human Rights Commission to conduct an investigation into racial tensions at the university. \"The abhorrent footage of students abusing university workers is a fundamental infringement on the victims' constitutional right to have their dignity respected and protected,\" Zille said in a statement posted on the group's Web site. \"This incident is symptomatic of racial tensions that have been simmering at the campus for some time over the issue of hostel [residence] integration,\" she said. Fourie acknowledged in his statement that \"the university is going through a difficult time with its efforts to racially integrate its residences and to create a new residence culture based on diversity, respect, human dignity and human rights.\" He added, \"These kinds of actions make it all the more important that we succeed with establishing such a new institutional culture on the campus. I appeal to all staff and students to remain calm and to act in the best interests of the university.\" The university, a research center, is one of South Africa's oldest; founded in 1904. It has more than 25,000 students, according to its Web site, and uses a parallel-medium instruction in English and Afrikaans for its full range of undergraduate and graduate programs.

Oil money is paying for Saudi Arabia's growth but it is also the main cause of rising prices . The kingdom is awash in cash which keeps pouring into the world's largest oil producer as prices rise. Last year alone, Saudi is estimated to have raked in about $200 billion from oil. It is this influx of money which is paying for Saudi Arabia's economic growth -- but it is also the main cause of rising prices across the country. \"There is no free lunch. If you want to grow at that base, you have to swallow a price every once in a while in the form of high inflation,\" said Abdulrahman Al Harithi, CEO of investment bank, MENA Financial Group. Saudi people are certainly paying the price. Inflation is currently running at 9.6 percent -- a 30-year high. At the beginning of the year, rental costs went up nearly 17 percent. In March, the cost of fuel and water increased almost 16 percent and other everyday staples also saw double digit gains. The kingdom's business community is also concerned about the adverse effects of inflation. A recent survey of Saudi Arabia's business confidence by financial services company, SABB, found that while confidence remains robust, over half of respondents were concerned that inflation would lead to rising business costs. Prices in the kingdom will continue their upward trend, according to the analysts at SABB. What's more, there is not much the Saudi government can do to combat it. The riyal, like many other Gulf currencies, is pegged to the U.S. dollar and while the Gulf is booming, the U.S. is heading towards recession. As the economic fortunes of the two countries continue to diverge it is hard to see what can be done to combat inflation. The main problem is that whenever the U.S. Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, like it did this week, the kingdom must follow suit. In a booming economy like Saudi's, low interest rates push prices through the roof. The government is studying whether remedies like a minimum wage could ease the pain but some in the kingdom, like Al Harithi, say there is no quick solution. \"Honestly, I don't' think there is an answer for such a question. I don't think there is a magical formula that could fix this issue,\" he told CNN.

She was seriously burned. Dalits, or \"untouchables,\" are victims of discrimination in India despite laws aimed at eliminating prejudice. The girl is a Dalit, or an \"untouchable,\" according to India's traditional caste system. India's constitution outlaws caste-based discrimination, and barriers have broken down in large cities. Prejudice, however, persists in some rural areas of the country. The girl was walking with her mother down a path in the city of Mathura when she was accosted by a man in his late teens, said police superintendent R.K. Chaturvedi. \"He scolded them both and pushed her,\" Chaturvedi said. The girl fell about 3 to 4 feet into pile of burning embers by the side of the road. The girl remained in critical condition Wednesday. The man confessed to the crime and was charged with attempted murder, Chaturvedi said. The assault took place in India's Uttar Pradesh state, about 150 km (93 miles) south of Delhi. The state is governed by Mayawati, a woman who goes by one name and is India's most powerful Dalit politician. Her Bahujan Samaj Party seeks to get more political representation for Dalits, who are considered so low in the social order that they don't even rank among the four classes that make up the caste system. Hindus believe there are five main groups of people, four of which sprang from the body of the first man. The Brahmin class comes from the mouth. They are the priests and holy men, the most elevated of the castes. Next is the Ksatriyas, the kings, warriors and soldiers created from the arms. The Vaisyas come from the thighs. They are the merchants and traders of society. And the Sudras, or laborers, come from the feet. The last group is the Dalits, or the \"untouchables.\" They're considered too impure to have come from the primordial being. Untouchables are often forced to work in menial jobs. They drink from separate wells. They use different entry ways, coming and going from buildings. They number about 250 million in India, about 25 percent of the population, according to the Colorado, U.S.-based Dalit Freedom Network. \"Dalits are seen to pollute higher caste people if they come in touch with them, hence the 'untouchables,'\" the group says on its Web site. \"If a higher caste Hindu is touched by, or even had a Dalit's shadow fall across them, they consider themselves to be polluted and have to go through a rigorous series of rituals to be cleansed.\" Recent weeks has seen a rise in violence against Dalits in Uttar Pradesh, CNN's sister network, CNN-IBN, reported Wednesday.

Barack Obama, in his first interview since the North Carolina and Indiana primaries, speaks with Wolf Blitzer. In his first interview since the North Carolina and Indiana primaries, Obama said he thinks the United States' influence around the world has been diminishing. \"The world wants to see the United States lead. They've been disappointed and disillusioned over the last seven, eight years,\" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in an interview on \"The Situation Room.\" \"I think there is still a sense everywhere I go that if the United States regains its sense of who it is and our values and our ideals, that we will continue to set the tone for a more peaceful and prosperous world.\"  Watch the full interview with Obama \u00bb . Obama said he thinks the way the war in Iraq has been handled has kept the United States from focusing on key issues like energy policy, global warming and the economy.

Clinton squeaked out a win in Indiana by 2 points. In the days after those contests, some top Democrats have called on Clinton to step aside. Obama deflected a question about a potential joint ticket with the New York senator, saying it's too early to start thinking about running mates. \"Sen. Clinton has shown herself to be an extraordinary candidate. She's tireless, she's smart, she's capable, and so obviously she'd be on anybody's short list to be a potential vice presidential candidate,\" he said. \"But it would be presumptuous of me at this point ... to somehow suggest that she should be my running mate.\"   Watch viewer responses to question: Should Obama offer Clinton the No. 2 spot? \u00bb .

Hillary has earned the right to do whatever she wants to do.\" Obama said he's ready for what would be the next phase if he becomes the nominee: a matchup against Sen. John McCain, the presumptive GOP candidate. Obama said he was offended when McCain said last month, \"It's very clear who Hamas wants to be the next president.\" \"I think it's disappointing because John McCain always says, 'Well, I'm not going to run that kind of politics,' and then to engage in that kind of smear I think is unfortunate, particularly since my policy on Hamas has been no different than his,\" Obama said. \"And so for him to toss out comments like that, I think, is an example of him losing his bearings as he pursues this nomination.\" When asked to respond to McCain supporters -- such as former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney -- who have said Obama is not ready to be commander in chief, the senator from Illinois said he thinks what people are looking for is \"good judgment.\" \"I think I've consistently displayed the kind of judgment that the American people are looking for in the next president,\" he said.

On May 4, 2007, a ferocious twister blasted Greensburg, Kansas, killing 11 people in the town of 1,400. Yet what is happening in the city's rebuilding process may not only re-invent Greensburg but provide a model for \"green\" building everywhere. Just a week after the deadly tornado hit May 4, 2007, a similar idea sparked in the mayor, a representative from the governor's office and a nonprofit expert from a nearby town. The concept: If the whole town had to be rebuilt anyway, why not be bold and build it as a global example of conservation, energy efficiency and creativity? Daniel Wallach, the nonprofit specialist, soon got the green light to help residents and businesses start over in a project known as Greensburg GreenTown. \"Kansas is known for being very conservative,\" Wallach said.  Watch how the town went green \u00bb . \"My first order of business was to listen. What I heard were a lot of concerns about politicization and being associated with 'tree huggers.' I helped frame it with the people here in such a way they saw, this is their movement,\" he said. Fifth-generation Greensburg resident Anita Hohl joined the staff of Greensburg GreenTown as a Web specialist. \"I was pretty green to begin with. I used to get teased about being a tree hugger. Now it's 'the thing!' This has really brought us so much closer together. What you can accomplish when just a few people are working toward the same goal is amazing,\" she said. Her farming grandparents instilled the virtue of being energy-efficient. \"My grandma always put her clothes on the line, did her own gardening and re-used everything,\" Hohl said. Hohl and her husband, a daughter, a son, four cats, a dog and two birds are among the Greensburg residents in \"FEMAville,\" a cluster of mobile homes set up as temporary housing. The family hopes to break ground soon for their new house and move in by Thanksgiving. Although they have made the best of the cramped quarters, she says, there are some challenges. \"It sort of feels like living in a cheap motel! But it's a lot better than it could be. It's nice to have a place to be,\" she said. From the start, the GreenTown staff knew that getting the business community on board with the green plan was vital. And in rural America, there is no business that's more of a bedrock than the John Deere dealership. In Greensburg, that dealership has been in the Estes family for four generations. Their facility was wiped out by the twister. \"The building was a total loss. And we saved only 13 pieces of machinery out of 220 on the lot,\" Kelly Estes said. \"The FEMA guy said he had never seen anything like it. Steel twisted into brick, and then the miles per hour needed to pick up combines that weigh 25,000 pounds and move them half a mile in the air,\" he said. Kelly and his brother Mike decided to rebuild in town to the highest green-building standard. The U.S. Green Building Council establishes a rating system for efficient buildings called LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. The Greensburg facility is aiming for LEED platinum, the most demanding standard. There is one wind turbine on their new property, a 100-foot structure designed to generate 5 kilowatts of electricity. It is providing power for the construction site. Although \"green\" may be viewed as trendy and new by some, Mike Estes knows that it is not for show. \"We're looking at saving money here; truthfully, we are. We're running a business. If we can't make this make sense, why would we do it?\" he asked. And he says the non-political approach of the city in encouraging energy efficiency has helped. \"I don't think it's red or blue to be green; I think green is green, and green makes sense. And green saves you green!\" he said with a laugh. Being a model for the world in energy efficiency is a major goal of Greensburg GreenTown. But there is another even more urgent aim: keeping this rural town from disappearing. The lack of jobs in many small towns means that after teenagers graduate from high school, they have to leave to find other opportunities. \"The average age of people living in rural communities is in their 50s,\" Wallach said. \"There are very few folks in the communities under that age, because there are just no jobs. Families have been split up for decades.\" So in addition to the long-term goal of Greensburg's pre-tornado businesses from leaving, people hope to attract new green trade as well. The city wants to open a biodiesel facility as one of its first green newcomers. Another long-term goal is to have 100 percent renewable energy. It is probable that the greatest contribution would come from large wind turbines. \"The timing of all this is, in some ways, almost spooky,\" Wallach said. \"It's like the world was ready for this to happen, for a town to be completely re-imagined. The tragedy was terrible. But the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity.\" E-mail to a friend .", "8ab7fe3b19bb45c977cb74ed675579a20611ad9b": "(CNN) -- They're big, strong, and fierce -- and they wear little blue booties. The police dogs in Duesseldorf, Germany are now patrolling the pavement in protective shoes that their police-officer handlers strap onto their paws. The reason? Too many glass shards left by beer drinkers in the city center, said Andre Hartwich, a spokesman for police in Duesseldorf. \"We wondered how can we protect our dogs' feet against glass,\" said Hartwich. \"We looked on the Internet and found these shoes.\" Beer drinkers along the Rhine River and in the city's Altstadt, or Old Town, often discard beer bottles on pebbled walkways. Broken glass poses a problem for the police force's 20 German Shepherds and Belgian Shepherds, Hartwich said. In addition, hooligans and vandals leave behind glass shards around New Year's Eve and during the city's famous Carnival celebrations. So what's a dog to do? Their handlers shelled out 60 euros -- $89 -- for shoes that are also worn by dogs who walk on ice in Alaska. Dogs need a month of training to get used to wearing the shoes, Hartwich said. \"We have to condition the dogs to the shoes,\" he said.

A member of the protest group Hawaiian Kingdom Government unlocks the palace gate. \"It is through a greater realm than ours\" that the group took this action, said Mahealani Kahau, elected leader of the group, called Hawaiian Kingdom Government. \"Today and every day, we will be here to assume our role.\" Group members left the palace grounds Wednesday afternoon, but vowed to return Thursday morning, The Honolulu Advertiser reported. \"We'll be here at 6 o'clock in the morning,\" Kahau told the newspaper. The group is one of several in Hawaii that reject statehood and seek to return to the constitutional monarchy that effectively ended in 1893 when a group of politicians, businessmen and sugar planters -- aided by the U.S. minister to Hawaii -- overthrew the kingdom's government. The monarchist groups say that the kingdom was overthrown and annexed into the United States illegally. Hawaii's office of the attorney general did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on Wednesday's action. The staff of Iolani Palace, built in 1882 and now operated as a museum, shut down the building to visitors. The 60 or so protesters occupied the grounds, chaining the gates and stationing guards there to explain to visitors the purpose of the action. The group later reopened the gates, but remained on the grounds and the building was kept closed. \"It saddens my heart to have to turn away visitors,\" said palace staff member Cindy Ascencio, who added that although she, too, is a native Hawaiian, she does not understand the actions of the group. Ascencio also said that the group appeared peaceful and she was not concerned about security. Jose Carrion, a visitor to Hawaii from Puerto Rico, told Honolulu's KHON-TV that he was \"disappointed\" he wouldn't be able to visit the ornate palace and \"learn about the culture of the Hawaiians.\" \"We wanted to come here precisely because we thought we'd learn something about the history of Hawaii and the last queen and the monarchy,\" said Carrion, who said he had reservations for the visit. \"But we're leaving tomorrow so we won't get to see the palace.\" But Carrion also said he \"kind of understood\" the actions of the group. Puerto Rico and Hawaii, along with Guam and the Philippines, were annexed into the United States in 1898 after the Spanish-American War. Guam and Puerto Rico remain territories of the United States. The Philippines gained independence after World War II, and Hawaii became the 50th state in 1959. Although the monarchy was not overthrown until 1893, its fate effectively was sealed six years earlier when the same group that forced the overthrow imposed a new constitution on King David Kalakaua, who was forced to sign it under threat of arms. The document dramatically reduced the authority of the monarchy and instituted voter requirements that limited voting to wealthy businessmen and Hawaiian landowners, barring 75 percent of the native Hawaiian population and all Asians. When Queen Lili'uokalani ascended the throne after the death of her brother in 1891, she began work on a new constitution that would have effectively reversed the 1887 document. With the help of John L. Stevens, the U.S. minister to Hawaii, the elite group that had changed the constitution in 1887 opposed the queen's actions. Two years later, under threat of U.S. troops, she yielded her authority, saying, \"Until such time as the Government of the United States shall ... undo the action of its representative and reinstate me in the authority which I claim as the constitutional sovereign of the Hawaiian Islands.\" The queen was later imprisoned in Iolani Palace for eight months for her participation in an attempted 1895 revolt, until she relinquished her claim to the throne in return for her release. She died in 1917 at 79. In 1993, the U.S. Congress approved, and President Clinton signed, an apology to the people of the Hawaiian Islands. The document \"acknowledges that the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States and further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum.\" Although it was used as a seat of government for decades after the deposition of Lili'uokalani, the palace fell into disrepair. When the last of the government office moved out and into new facilities adjacent to the palace in 1969, restoration work began. It opened to the public in 1978.

Amy Winehouse's battles with her addiction are well-documented. \"Coke-snorting fashionistas are not only damaging their noses and brains -- they are contributing to state failure on the other side of the world,\" wrote Antonio Maria Costa, the executive director of the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime. The comments, published in an opinion piece in the British newspaper The Observer, was the second time in two weeks that the United Nations has criticized celebrity drug use. A report last week by the International Narcotics Control Board said that drug laws should not be disproportionately applied. And letting celebrities get away with drug use creates a perception among youth that those offenders are treated leniently. Read about the earlier warning from the United Nations drug control agency . Costa, in his piece, said the cocaine used in Europe passes through impoverished countries in west Africa where governments haven't been able to mount an effective fight against the drug traders. \"In the 19th century, Europe's hunger for slaves devastated west Africa,\" he said. \"Two hundred years later, its growing appetite for cocaine could do the same.\" The drug trade, Costa said, has corrupted the governments of some countries, and created addicts in a continent where treatment facilities are rare. \"Amy Winehouse might adopt a defiant pose and slur her way through 'Rehab' (her Grammy Award-winning hit) but does she realize the message she sends to others who are vulnerable to addiction and who cannot afford expensive treatment?\" he said. Winehouse's battles with her addiction are well-documented. The singer -- whose song \"Rehab\" describes her reluctance to enter a rehabilitation center -- checked herself into one on January 24 after the leak of a home video that showed her smoking something in a glass pipe. What was in the pipe was unknown. Scotland Yard has said it is looking into the video. Winehouse scooped up five statues at the Grammy Awards last month, including the best record and song of the year for \"Rehab.\" Winehouse's spokesman, Chris Goodman, called Costa a \"ludicrous man.\" \"Amy has never given a quote about drugs or flaunted it in any way,\" Goodman told the newspaper. \"She's had some problems and is trying to get better. The U.N. should get its own house in order.\" Costa also took model Kate Moss to task, contrasting her alleged actions to those of singers Bob Geldof and Bono who have campaigned against poverty in Africa. Bob Geldof is best known for organizing a series of benefit concerts, including Live Aid. Bono, the frontman for U2, has taken on a campaign to get Western nations to write off the debt they are owed by some African countries. \"For every rebel with a cause, there are 10 others without a clue,\" Costa wrote. \"While some well-meaning pop idols and film stars might rage against suffering in Africa, their work is being undermined by the drug habits of careless peer such as Kate Moss.\" Three years ago, London's Daily Mirror newspaper printed photos it said showed the Moss using cocaine. She later issued a statement where she apologized to \"all the people I have let down\" and said she took \"full responsibility\" for her actions.

Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni attend the opening of the mosque. Several of the guards to the visiting heads of state from Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Mali, Somalia, Sudan and Djibouti sustained serious injuries in the fight, which included punches, kicks and the drawing of guns. No leaders were hurt in the melee, though several were knocked over. Several journalists also were caught up in the fracas and suffered injuries or lost their grips on cameras and recorders. The incident occurred at the opening of a massive Gadhafi National Mosque in Kampala, a structure begun by the late Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in 1972 and completed with financing from Libya, according to African media reports. Minutes after Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and his host, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, jointly unveiled a plaque to mark the event, the Libyan guards pushed away the guards of other delegations at the mosque's entrance. The Ugandan guards -- who had traded hostilities with the predominantly-Arab Libyan guards at every joint event since Gadhafi's arrival in the country Sunday -- reacted with fury and fought back. Museveni briefly lost his balance when a hefty Libyan guard pushed him to a wall. Another Libyan guard pushed Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who also lost his balance but was caught by his own guards. The vice president of Tanzania was knocked over by fighting guards as he was taking his shoes off to enter the mosque. Guards to the rest of the visiting presidents and prime ministers kept their respective leaders out of the fray, with some drawing their guns as the dignitaries looked on in disbelief. Some leaders -- notably those from Somalia, Burundi and Djibouti -- were visibly uneasy as guns were drawn on all sides. By the time the fight was over more than six minutes later, about a dozen presidential guards were left bleeding from compound fractures and the Libyan and Ugandan protocol officials traded bitter accusations of disrespect and racism. \"What are your people up to? Do you want to kill our leader?\" a Libyan protocol official said to his Ugandan counterpart. The Ugandan official, who declined to be named, shouted back, \"Why do think you're superior? What makes you think Uganda has any ill intention against Gadhafi?\" The Ugandan official said Museveni's guards were simply doing their job as security for the host country and had a right to respond when the Libyan guards pushed them back. It has taken 36 years to complete the giant mosque on a hill in the heart of Kampala. It used to be a colonial fort named after British Capt. Frederick Lugard. The mosque can accommodate as many as 17,000 people at one time, according to the engineers, who call it the largest mosque in sub-Saharan Africa. Many Muslims interviewed said the mosque's opening evoked sweet memories of Amin, the deceased dictator. \"It is a great day and thanks be to Allah for the completion,\" said Salim Abdul Noor, 39. \"This should remind us that while Amin is demonized as Africa's worst dictator, there are many things he did for this country that successive governments largely depend on, and much of the completed installations and structures like this beautiful mosque was Amin's dream, may Allah rest him in peace.\" The Swedish vice president of the European Islamic Conference, Adly Abu Hajar, 57, said the mosque heals rifts in a religion introduced to Uganda in 1844 by Arab slave traders. \"I find this complex has brought unity among Muslims in Uganda. There have been so many factions, but this attraction has brought them together, identifying themselves with a common home.\" The fight prompted a crisis meeting by Ugandan security authorities, after which invited diplomats from mainly the European missions in Uganda expressed dismay. \"It's disgrace. It shows there is something wrong yet unknown between the two parties,\" said the head of one European mission in Kampala, who declined to be named. The police chief, Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura, and the head of the army, Gen. Aronda Nyakairima, declined to comment on the fight. But Capt. Edison Kwesiga, the spokesman of the Ugandan Presidential Guard Brigade, confirmed their hostile relationship with the Libyans. \"It is our responsibility to ensure the safety of any visiting head of state. We have to do our job using any means. But our Libyan brothers always want us to fail. True, it's not the first time they come and act as you see,\" Kwesiga said.

The Catalan club confirmed on Wednesday that Messi will miss both legs of Barcelona's Champions League quarterfinal encounter. It will also be a race against time for the 2007 World Player of the Year runner-up to be fit for the semifinals if Barcelona get past an opponent who will be named after the draw on March 14.

It is third time in the last three years that Messi has had the same injury, the last occasion being on December 15 against Valencia, which ruled him out of the 'El Clasico' derby the following week against Real Madrid. In addition to his chronic problems with his left thigh, Messi has had four other significant injuries in the last two years which have caused him to miss a month or more.

Investigators search for the body of Marine Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach on Saturday. An arrest warrant has been issued for Cpl. Cesar Armando Laurean in the death of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach. He is charged with first-degree murder, although authorities have not positively identified the body as hers. \"This is consistent with what we were looking for: A pregnant lady who is the victim Maria Lauterbach and her unborn child,\" Brown said. The body was charred, and the fetus was in the victim's abdomen, Brown said, describing the scene in gruesome detail. The fetus was developed enough that the \"little hand was about the size of my thumb. The little fingers were rolled up,\" he said. \"One of the things that will probably stick with me for a long time, and forever, is that little hand, the way those fingers were turned, that had been burned off the arm. That is bizarre. That is tragic. And it's disgusting.\"  Watch Brown describe the scene \u00bb . The remains were taken to the Onslow County medical examiner's office. They will next be sent to the chief medical examiner in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, for DNA testing and comparison with dental records. Lauterbach, 20, disappeared, when she was eight months pregnant, from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, in mid-December, not long before she was to testify at a military hearing about her rape accusation against Laurean. Laurean is believed to have left the base at 4 a.m. Friday, and a nationwide manhunt is under way.  Watch authorities search for a grave \u00bb . Lauterbach's relatives believe her pregnancy was the result of the alleged rape, said Lauterbach's uncle, Peter Steiner, a Kentucky psychiatrist. Investigators told CNN that Laurean vanished four hours before his wife, Christina, approached Brown with a note from her husband claiming that Lauterbach had committed suicide and he buried the body. \"We believe our suspect has fled the state of North Carolina; removed himself as far from here as he can get,\" Brown said Saturday.  Watch Brown describe the cavity where the body was found \u00bb . Brown said Friday that blood spatter evidence was found inside Laurean's home, even on a ceiling. There was evidence of \"an attempted clean-up,\" including an attempt to paint over the blood spatter, he said. \"Evidence now is saying what he's claiming happened did not happen like he said it happened,\" Brown said of Laurean. Lauterbach's mother, Mary Lauterbach, reported the young woman as missing from Camp Lejeune on December 19. Mary Lauterbach said she had not talked with her for five days.  Watch police face unanswered questions \u00bb . Laurean, 21, of Nevada, is believed to be driving a black Dodge pickup with North Carolina license plate TRR1522. Laurean repeatedly refused to meet with investigators, finally telling them that his attorney wouldn't let him. The sheriff described him as \"dangerous,\" especially if cornered. Military officials said Laurean was not taken into custody after Lauterbach reported the alleged rape because there was information the two carried on \"some sort of friendly relationship\" after she filed the complaint against him. \"The information ... leads us to believe that she still had some kind of contact\" with him, said Paul Ciccarelli, agent in charge of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service at Camp Lejeune, this week. Because of that, Laurean wasn't considered a flight risk, he said. Steiner disputed that, and said his niece had no relationship with Laurean.

Serbian riot police stand in front of the damaged U.S. Embassy in Belgrade on Friday. The U.S. ambassador, Cameron Munter, is staying, officials said. The embassy was closed Friday, and a handful of riot police holding shields stood outside the building, its outer walls blackened from fires set the night before and some of its windows smashed. It will remain closed until Monday or Tuesday so officials can assess the damage, said Bill Wanlund, the embassy's spokesman. He said embassy staff were still in a heightened state of alert but there were no specific threats against any staff members. The United States has warned the Serbian government that it has a responsibility to protect its assets. A top U.S. diplomat was asked during an interview on CNN if the Serbian government \"gets\" the warning. \"They'd better get it, because they have a fundamental responsibility to protect our diplomats and our embassy and to protect American citizens,\" said Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs R. Nicholas Burns. \"What happened yesterday in Belgrade was absolutely reprehensible.\"  Watch Burns' angry comments on Belgrade attack \u00bb . Thursday's violence erupted after demonstrations by thousands of Serbs against Kosovo's declaration of independence. The anger directed against the United States and other countries for recognizing the breakaway province as a nation sparked attacks on Western embassies and shops by hundreds of people. Burns said there was an \"insufficient\" number of security people guarding the U.S. Embassy at a demonstration everyone knew would take place. He said security \"melted away\" as \"the mob attacked our embassy.\" \"This kind of thing should not happen in a civilized country. It doesn't happen in the United States of America. It doesn't happen in most world capitals. So the Serb government needs to reflect seriously about the responsibility it has under the Vienna Convention,\" he said. Burns, the third highest ranking diplomat in the State Department, said he told the Serbian prime minister, Vojislav Kostunica, and his government that the U.S. \"would hold them personally responsible for the safety of our people.\" \"They assured me that they would have adequate security on the ground today and for every day to come. We will hold them to that commitment,\" Burns said. Demonstrators only managed to break into one U.S. embassy building, which Wanlund said was rarely used by staff. He said the protesters didn't manage to get any documents or embassy materials. Only Marines and security guards were present at the embassy when the angry mob of about 100 approached the walls. In addition to the U.S. Embassy, the protesters attacked other Western interests including the embassies of Britain and Germany, as well as a McDonald's restaurant and a Nike shop. \"One might understand the emotion, but not the violence, and that's what the Serb government needs to remember,\" Burns said. Burns, who is stepping down in March, has long been involved in trying to resolve tensions in the former Yugoslavia. The situation was complicated by Sunday's unilateral declaration of independence by Serbia's predominantly Albanian region of Kosovo.  Kosovo is revered historically by Orthodox Christian Serbs but also is claimed as separate and distinct by its ethnic Muslim Albanians. The wisdom of recognizing Kosovo independence has been questioned by many observers, who say the United States won't recognize other unilateral declarations of independence. Some opponents of Kosovo's independence say recognition is a bad precedent if it's unilateral and not done in a bilateral, diplomatic setting. They say it will give others the incentive to stage their own breakaway nations. Burns said every situation has its unique set of circumstances, as does Kosovo, which was the victim of ethnic cleansing policies by the Slobodan Milosevic regime in 1999. NATO troops fought Serbia in an air war then and pushed Serbian forces out of the region. Since then Kosovo has been run by the United Nations and with security supplied by NATO forces.

The giant pandas' primary food source is bamboo. Authorities confirmed Tuesday that captive animals in two of China's major panda reserves were alive, according to Xinhua, China's official news agency. The Wolong Giant Panda Reserve Center in southwest Sichuan province is home to about 86 giant pandas, who were reported safe Tuesday. Staff and critters at neighboring Chengdu Panda Breeding and Research Center were also reported safe, according to a spokesperson for the Atlanta Zoo, which has two pandas on loan from the wildlife reserve. Concern arose in the international wildlife community over damage to the animals' habitat, as authorities continued assessing the scope of damage in the Sichuan province. The mountainous, densely wooded region is the natural habitat for most of the 1,200 giant pandas living in the wild, making it an obvious location for research bases like Wolong and Chengdu. Giant pandas roam the forest in \"open cages\" that are meant to provide them with a safe, natural environment that will prepare them for release. With the safety of the pandas confirmed, the animals' caregivers are left to determine how resources like food and medical supplies will reach the bases, which contain breeding facilities and triage centers. Bamboo, the pandas' primary source of food, is a major agricultural product in the region, but whether it can be supplied to the pandas despite infrastructure damage is open to question. \"Wolong is hard to access under normal conditions, so the heavy road damage makes it even harder,\" said Kerry Zobor, spokesperson for the World Wildlife Fund. Zobor said WWF had confirmed the safety of staff based in Beijing, but had not received word on the conditions in Wolong. She said the WWF was also concerned about members who had been touring the country when the earthquake struck. So far, the group has not been located. Scientists in the United States are hopeful that Chinese researchers will adapt to the situation facing them. David Wildt with the Smithsonian's National Zoological Park in Washington says that scientists in Wolong have overcome threats to the giant panda population before. In the late 1990s, the captive giant panda population was in decline, with more animals dying than were born, Wildt said. Thanks to a collaborative effort with American scientists, the Wolong staff was able to reverse the trend. \"Our Chinese colleagues are very perceptive when it comes to addressing problems,\" said Wildt, who has visited Wolong many times as part of the Smithsonian's affiliation with the research base. \"Because of their efforts, the population is on the rise today.\" Wildt said that Chinese scientists have also addressed the issue of alternative food sources before. \"Artificial diets in the form of protein biscuits have been created for giant pandas. They're not a complete substitute, but they meet the needs of a basic high-fiber diet,\" said Wildt, who has worked with two pandas that the Smithsonian has on loan from Wolong. \"Right now, we're mostly concerned about the staff. If the staff is fine, then the animals will be fine,\" Wildt said.", "31d0ed7b1b8f65c6479fb35683d72de21d70796a": "(CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton received the most votes in two pivotal Democratic primary contests Tuesday, scoring wins in Texas and Ohio that were considered critical to keeping alive her White House hopes. Sen. Hillary Clinton is the winner in Ohio and Texas primaries, but trails in the Texas caucuses. With 99 percent of precincts reporting in Ohio, Clinton had 54 percent of the vote compared to 44 percent for Sen. Barack Obama. The race was closer in Texas where, with 99 percent of precincts in, Clinton had 51 percent to Obama's 48 percent. A complicated formula in Texas that weighs delegates more heavily in highly populated areas and includes a caucus that was still being tallied Wednesday afternoon meant the delegate count there remained unclear. Obama was leading Clinton in the caucus vote 56 percent to 44 percent with 38 percent of the state counted, party officials said. The party will split 67 delegates between the candidates in proportion to the final caucus results.  Watch an I-Report video from a Democratic caucus \u00bb . A final tally was not expected until Thursday afternoon, officials said. Regardless, the two wins were crucial for Clinton, who would have found it difficult to continue the race if Obama won big Tuesday. \"For everyone across America who has been counted out but refused to be knocked out, for everyone who has stumbled but stood right back up and for everyone who works hard and never gives up, this one is for you,\" Clinton said to a cheering crowd in Columbus, Ohio.  Watch Clinton thank backers \u00bb . After a month of losses to Obama, Clinton had been expected to do well in Ohio -- where the blue-collar workers who have consistently supported her throughout the campaign make up a large chunk of the Democratic base. But with polls showing the Ohio contest neck-and-neck in the days leading up to the primary, Clinton got a boost from female voters and those who only recently made up their minds. According to CNN exit polling, 59 percent of the voters in the state's Democratic primary were women. Those female voters favored Clinton over Obama, 58 percent to 40 percent. In the past week, Clinton sharpened her attacks on Obama -- questioning whether he has enough experience to lead the nation and attempting to cast doubt on his opposition to international trade agreements that many in Ohio feel have led to job losses. Poll results suggest it may have worked. Among those polled, 64 percent of those who decided their vote in the last three days chose Clinton. Clinton was believed to need strong performances in Tuesday's contests in Ohio and Texas to halt Obama's momentum in the race and stay alive in the hunt for the 2,025 delegates needed to win the nomination. As early returns were counted Tuesday, Obama ran a string of consecutive victories to 12 with a lopsided win in Vermont. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, he led Clinton 59 percent to 39 percent. But Clinton snapped that streak in Rhode Island. With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Clinton had taken 58 percent of the vote to Obama's 40 percent. Speaking in San Antonio, Texas, Obama told supporters he expected to hold a similar delegate lead over Clinton after Tuesday's races to the one he held before. \"We know this -- no matter what happens tonight, we have nearly the same delegate lead we had this morning and we are on the way to winning this nomination,\" he said to cheers and chants of his trademark phrase, \"Yes we can.\"  Watch an excerpt of Obama's speech to supporters \u00bb . With Texas' delegates still to be awarded, Clinton had picked up 22 delegates after results in Ohio, Rhode Island and Vermont were tallied. Obama entered the day holding a lead of just over 100 delegates, with 1,369 pledged delegates and superdelegates to Clinton's 1,267, according to CNN estimates. In Ohio, harsh weather and balloting problems stretched the polling well into the evening. With polls slated to close at 7:30 p.m., state elections officials decided to extend voting until 9 p.m. in northern Ohio's Sandusky County. The area was hit by freezing rain for much of the day, and ballot shortages were reported in the Cleveland and Columbus areas -- also causing the polls to be open until 9 p.m. Texas, with its 193 Democratic delegates, and Ohio, with 141, were the biggest prizes in Tuesday's contests. There were 15 Democratic delegates at stake in Vermont and 21 in Rhode Island. 'Texas two-step' Texas' results may not be as easy to measure as counting votes. In what pundits have been calling the \"Texas two-step,\" the state's Democratic Party held a primary election, in which 126 delegates were awarded, and a post-election caucus in which another 67 are at stake. It's possible for the loser of the primary to win more delegates with a strong showing in the caucuses. Texas' method of awarding delegates in the primary -- with more delegates coming from large population centers like Houston, Dallas and Austin -- further complicates the matter. As polling places closed Tuesday, Texans reportedly lined up in bigger-than-expected numbers for the caucuses -- in some places lining up in parking lots and overflowing buildings where caucuses were held. Party officials Wednesday said 1.1 million voters participated in the caucuses. A CNN I-Reporter in Houston said there were hundreds of people at his polling place -- he said he waited more than an hour just to sign in. At an Austin caucus, about 800 people showed up -- far outstripping expectations and causing organizers to stand on tables and yell to organize caucus-goers, one voter said. Clinton supporters had said a strong performance would keep her campaign alive. Weeks ago, former President Clinton predicted his wife would need wins in Texas and Ohio to stay in the race. \"If Hillary Clinton gets out a small win in Ohio and Texas, it will be like Punxsutawney Phil seeing his shadow,\" said political adviser and Clinton supporter Paul Begala, referring to the six more weeks of winter the groundhog is said to predict. The Obama campaign, however, said the arithmetic of the delegate count will make it difficult for Clinton to overcome Obama's lead. \"They've had a really bad run and they have to rationalize continuing,\" said Obama spokesman David Axelrod. \"We've won more popular votes and more delegates, and they have to give some rationale for staying in this race.\"  E-mail to a friend .", "b03ee4df6492038d0a1d99a1717d8ad8ccc06db3": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. border officers found a wire between two fences along the U.S.-Mexican border that, when stretched taut, could have seriously harmed or even decapitated Border Patrol agents, Congress was told Wednesday. The wire was about 4 feet high when pulled tight, or about neck level for an agent on an ATV, officials say. \"It was configured in a way so that, if it was pulled, it would take off the head of a Border Patrol agent riding in an open car,\" Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said at a House budget hearing. The wire was discovered Saturday when authorities monitoring a surveillance camera saw two people on the north side of the border east of the San Ysidro Port of Entry, in the San Diego sector. Border Patrol agents sent to the area found a thick metal wire tied to a secondary fence. The wire stretched across the border road and led into Mexico through a hole in the primary fence, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. When pulled tight, the wire would be about 4 feet high -- about neck level for an agent riding on an all-terrain vehicle, CBP said. Officials said they suspected that drug or illegal immigrant smugglers were involved. No arrests were made on either side of the border.

Barack Obama claimed a significant victory in the South Carolina Democratic primary on Saturday, telling supporters \"we are hungry for change.\" Sen. Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, celebrate his South Carolina win. The Illinois senator earned more than twice the vote that rival Sen. Hillary Clinton did, 55 percent to 27 percent, unofficial returns showed. Former Sen. John Edwards was third with 18 percent. \"Tonight, the cynics who believed that what began in the snows of Iowa was just an illusion were told a different story by the good people of South Carolina,\" Obama said to supporters Saturday.  Watch a recap of Obama's big win \u00bb . A win in South Carolina was considered crucial for Obama, who won Iowa but finished second to Clinton in New Hampshire and Nevada.  See what the results mean \u00bb . \"I did not travel around this state over the last year and see a white South Carolina or a black South Carolina. I saw South Carolina,\" he said. \"The choice in this election is not between regions or religions or genders,\" Obama said. \"It's not about rich versus poor; young versus old; and it is not about black versus white. \"It's about the past versus the future.\" Watch Obama speech . With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Obama had 55 percent of the vote. Clinton was second with 27 percent, followed by Edwards, with 18 percent. Obama's victory capped a heated contest in South Carolina, the first Democratic primary in the South and the first with a largely African-American electorate. Obama, who is hoping to become the the nation's first African-American president, did well with black voters, who made up about half of Saturday's electorate, according to exit polls. Black voters supported the Illinois senator by a margin of more than 4-to-1 over his nearest rival, exit polls indicate. Among white voters, Obama took about a quarter of the vote, with Clinton and Edwards roughly splitting the remainder, according to exit polls. Clinton congratulated Obama and said she was excited to move forward to the Super Tuesday contests on February 5. \"Millions and millions of Americans are going to have the chance to have their voices heard and their votes counted,\" she told supporters at Tennessee State University.  Watch Clinton speak to supporters \u00bb . Edwards also looked ahead to the next contests. \"Now the three of us move on to February 5, where millions of Americans will cast their vote and help shape the future of this party and help shape the future of America,\" he said.  Watch Edwards rally supporters \u00bb . \"Our campaign from the very beginning has been about one central thing, and that is to give voice to the millions of Americans who have absolutely no voice in this democracy.\" Clinton beat Obama only among elderly voters, according to exit polls. Among voters 65 and older, Clinton beat Obama 40 to 32 percent. But Obama handily defeated Clinton in every other bracket, and overall garnered 58 percent of the vote among 18 to 64-year-olds while 23 percent of those voters picked Clinton. And half of those polled said both candidates shared blame for the rancor between the two camps. Of those who said one of the contenders was more to blame than the other, 21 percent blamed Clinton, and 6 percent said Obama. \"It's fairly obvious it's not going to be over February 5,\" Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs said. Edwards was born in South Carolina and won the state's primary four years ago, when he was making his first bid for the White House.  See voters head to the polls in South Carolina \u00bb . Edwards had touted his native status, and as the Clinton and Obama camps have squabbled, Edwards continued to talk about the issues and suggests he's the only adult in the field.  Watch Edwards reach out to voters \u00bb . \"I'm keeping moving no matter what, but I feel good about how things are moving right now here today,\" Edwards told reporters Saturday morning. \"I feel there's a lot of energy behind my campaign.\" On January 15, Edwards pledged, \"I'm in this for the long haul. We're continuing to accumulate delegates. There's actually a very narrow margin between Sen. Obama, Sen. Clinton and myself on delegates.\" The state Democratic party estimated that more than 530,000 Democrats turned out for Saturday's primary, as compared with 445,000 voters who showed up to vote last weekend in the state's Republican primary. The Democratic numbers topped the GOP turnout for the first time since 1992, when 445,000 Republicans turned out to renominate President George H.W. Bush. Obama attracted more than 290,000 votes -- nearly matching the total turnout of the 2004 Democratic primary. \"This is an enormous turnout,\" CNN analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. \"Democrats are wildly motivated in this election.\" As South Carolina's Democratic primary voters went to the polls Saturday, almost half of them had made up their minds more than a month ago, according to exit polls. In the 2004 primary, nearly a quarter decided either the day of the primary or in the three days prior who they would support, but this year, only 10 percent of this year's voters waited until Saturday to choose. Another 10 percent decided only in the last three days, and 32 percent decided in the last month. Forty-seven percent made up their minds at least a month ago, more than double the percentage of 2004. The early exit polls were taken from a sampling of 1,269 voters statewide. Following a rough campaign between Clinton and Obama, the two camps toned down the rhetoric in the past two days, returning to the issues and concentrating their firepower on the Republicans rather than on each other. \"I think they [the Republicans] should be gracious and just say, \"We have messed this thing up so much we are just going to quit and ... we shouldn't be re-elected,' but I don't think that is what they are going to do,\" Clinton said. South Carolina is the last big test for the Democrats before Super Tuesday, February 5, when nearly two dozen states will hold either primaries or caucuses -- including such delegate-rich states as California, New York, New Jersey and Illinois. Florida holds its primary on Tuesday but no Democratic delegates are being awarded there because the national party is penalizing the state for moving its primary up earlier in the year.

His father told the 17-year-old high school football star to be home before dark. That is exactly what he was trying to do when, just before dusk, gunshots rang out. Gang members pulled up in a car and asked Shaw if he was in a gang. Shaw didn't have time to tell them \"no.\" He was mowed down before he could answer, police say. His dad heard the shots from inside his house and immediately called his son's cell phone to warn him to stay away. But within seconds, the father realized what had happened. \"I just ran down there,\" Jamiel Shaw Sr. told CNN.  Watch dad describe hearing \"pow, pow\" \u00bb . His son was wearing the same shirt his dad had pressed for him that morning. \"He was laying on the ground and his face was so peaceful. I knew he was dead.\" \"For three hours, I was just completely blacked out walking.\" More than 7,500 miles away, Army Sgt. Anita Shaw was serving her second tour in Iraq. Her commanding officer called her into his office and told her to sit down next to the chaplain. He then informed her that her son had been killed on the streets of Los Angeles. \"I freaked out,\" she said. \"I wanted to run out of the room. I was screaming and kicking. I was shouting, 'No.'\" Anita Shaw is now back in Los Angeles to bury her son. Police announced Tuesday that an arrest had been made in the shooting. Pedro Espinoza, a 19-year-old member of the Hispanic 18th Street Gang, was charged in the killing and could face the death penalty if convicted, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. Espinoza is scheduled to be arraigned March 25. Espinoza was released from jail -- where he was held on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon -- one day before the incident. Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton Tuesday called on the community to help police locate a second suspect who was with Espinoza at the time of the shooting. Hundreds of family members and friends gathered Tuesday at West Los Angeles Cathedral to remember Shaw, a standout running back and sprinter at Los Angeles High School who had good grades and stayed out of trouble despite his rough neighborhood. Among the schools recruiting him was Stanford University.  Watch as family, friends remember Shaw \u00bb .

He was so good.\" Shaw is one of several innocent victims in a horrifying three-week spate of gang-related shootings around Los Angeles. A man was gunned down as he held a 2-year-old baby in his arms. A 13-year-old boy was shot to death last week as he went to pick lemons from a tree. In another incident, a 6-year-old boy was critically wounded when he was shot in the head while riding in the car with his family; two gang members have been arrested in connection with that shooting, according to police. \"I think what is particularly unnerving for all of us is just the random nature of these shootings,\" Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said last week. Bratton and Deputy Chief Kenneth Garner met with community members from the South Side of Los Angeles over the weekend to try to calm tensions between black and Hispanic communities. Among those in attendance were Shaw's parents and his younger brother. Bratton acknowledged some neighborhoods are rife with underlying racial tensions that have \"taken too many young lives.\" He said he is in the process of hiring 1,000 new police officers to help combat inner city gang violence.  Watch Bratton describe an \"always underlying tension\" \u00bb . \"There's no denying that some of the crime in this city is a direct result of hatred, animosity, racial animosity, ethnic differences,\" Bratton said. \"We must all work to the best of our ability to try to prevent that.\" \"None of it is right,\" said Garner. \"We can't get so incensed that we lose focus that it's going on on both sides.\" He added, \"Wrong is wrong.\" The killing of Shaw has rallied his neighborhood. Dozens of people gathered outside his home for a vigil last week and placed candles, flowers and blue-and-white balloons at a makeshift memorial. One sign read, \"We love you!

Lewis Hamilton will be able to afford a lot more champagne in the future. The Briton is set to become one of the most marketable sport stars in the world -- perhaps second only to Tiger Woods -- and earn more than a billion dollars if he can maintain the buzz created by his first season in Formula One, experts say. On Sunday he started his second season in perfect fashion, easily winning the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. The 23-year-old signed a five-year contract with McLaren worth an estimated $140m in January. It leaves him lagging along way behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, who is paid an estimated $50m a year for driving, but it is through endorsements that he stands to reap a greater windfall. Stephen Cheliotis, chief executive of the Centre for Brand Analysis and UK Superbrands and CoolBrands Councils' chairman, said Hamilton was the most marketable driver because he was a breath of fresh air. He had helped drive up race attendance and television fewer figures dramatically in his first season. \"He is young, mixing with the right people everyday -- rappers, film stars -- and a lot more articulate than Kimi Raikkonen,\" Cheliotis said. \"He is also the first black driver and it does have a bearing, much like Tiger Woods in golf. He is also the most marketable because he is going to be the best, much like Michael Schumacher.\" Pippa Collett, Sponsorship Consulting's managing director, said Hamilton was certainly the most marketable driver in the short term. His performance meant he was the dominant member of a group of \"young turks\" -- Nelson Piquet Jr, Nico Rosberg, Heikki Kovalainen -- who had great potential. Collett said in terms of the media Hamilton's performance, friendliness, English speaking background and professionalism were key assets. If he could maintain these he would earn more than Schumacher -- the sport's first billionaire driver. Indeed, Schumacher set an example which Hamilton would be wise to follow. He was the first driver to win personal sponsors after Ferrari allowed him to sign a $10m annual deal with a German bank to place its logo on his cap. The German also actively pursued the development of his own retail range, which included caps -- he sold hundreds of thousands at $30 a pop -- and even a branded vacuum cleaner. Collett said Schumacher's manager, Willi Weber, was very good. \"Schumacher was a nice guy but not very charming. However, he was very professional and you knew he would turn up,\" Collett said. Cheliotis agreed Hamilton would earn considerably more than Schumacher, and that there would be a big gap between his earnings and that of the other drivers. However, there were pitfalls. Lewis had already made the mistake of saying he was moving to Switzerland to avoid the limelight when it was all about avoiding tax, Cheliotis said. \"He said that and then turned up at every awards night for a month.\" Cheliotis said appearing arrogant, being caught out by the tabloid press, endorsing a brand and then using another and over selling himself could also damage his value. \"The big danger with someone like Hamilton is that he is so in demand and that he has so many sponsors it leads to brand confusion. There is a danger of being one of 50 sponsors and not getting any value.\" Collett said Hamilton needed to develop his \"life-time brand\". While Raikkonen may not be a media darling he had developed an \"Iceman\" image, which was just as important in the long term. English footballer David Beckham, whose performance had dropped off, had successfully developed a life-time brand that would out last his playing career. Collett said Hamilton's one weakness may be his father, Anthony. \"His dad is his manager. Your brand positioning is as an individual... having your dad around too much could affect your brand.\" Collett said Hamilton would have to be wary of bad press, but a little bit of young turk behaviour could enhance his image as long as he continued to excel. \"I think that is part of the glamour... some of that and continued brilliant performances will make his life very easy.\" E-mail to a friend .", "1744093a3fea8b8de0777b1a228c3ba3e515d48e": "(CNN) -- China's giant pandas are believed to be safe after Monday's earthquake, but concern is growing over how they will get their next meals. Questions remain about whether infrastructure damage will harm the giant pandas' supply of bamboo. Authorities confirmed Tuesday that captive animals in two of China's major panda reserves were alive, according to Xinhua, China's official news agency. The Wolong Giant Panda Reserve Center in southwest Sichuan province is home to about 86 giant pandas, who were reported safe Tuesday. Staff and critters at neighboring Chengdu Panda Breeding and Research Center were also reported safe, according to a spokesperson for the Atlanta Zoo, which has two pandas on loan from the wildlife reserve. Concern arose in the international wildlife community over damage to the animals' habitat, as authorities continued assessing the scope of damage in the Sichuan province. The mountainous, densely wooded region is the natural habitat for most of the 1,200 giant pandas living in the wild, making it an obvious location for research bases like Wolong and Chengdu. Giant pandas roam the forest in \"open cages\" that are meant to provide them with a safe, natural environment that will prepare them for release. With the safety of the pandas confirmed, the animals' caregivers are left to determine how resources like food and medical supplies will reach the bases, which contain breeding facilities and triage centers. Bamboo, the pandas' primary source of food, is a major agricultural product in the region, but whether it can be supplied to the pandas despite infrastructure damage is open to question. \"Wolong is hard to access under normal conditions, so the heavy road damage makes it even harder,\" said Kerry Zobor, spokeswoman for the World Wildlife Fund. Zobor said the WWF had confirmed the safety of staff members based in Beijing but had not received word on the conditions in Wolong. She said the WWF was also concerned about members who had been touring the country when the earthquake struck. The group has not been located. Scientists in the United States are hopeful that Chinese researchers will adapt to the situation facing them. David Wildt with the Smithsonian's National Zoological Park in Washington says scientists in Wolong have overcome threats to the giant panda population before. In the late 1990s, the captive giant panda population was in decline, with more animals dying than were born, Wildt said. Thanks to a collaborative effort with American scientists, the Wolong staff was able to reverse the trend. \"Our Chinese colleagues are very perceptive when it comes to addressing problems,\" said Wildt, who has visited Wolong many times as part of the Smithsonian's affiliation with the research base. \"Because of their efforts, the population is on the rise today.\" Wildt said that Chinese scientists have also addressed the issue of alternative food sources. \"Artificial diets in the form of protein biscuits have been created for giant pandas. They're not a complete substitute, but they meet the needs of a basic high-fiber diet,\" said Wildt, who has worked with two pandas that the Smithsonian has on loan from Wolong. \"Right now, we're mostly concerned about the staff. If the staff is fine, then the animals will be fine,\" Wildt said.", "4929479f70e89deb22539e7d2caa6c33bbb0a14f": "(CNN) -- Red Cross President and CEO Mark W.

Everson, 53, said in a written statement that he was leaving the $500,000-per-year job \"for personal and family reasons, and deeply regret it is impossible for me to continue in a job so recently undertaken.\" Everson -- who is married and has two children -- joined the Red Cross as president and CEO last May. The organization became aware of Everson's relationship with a female Red Cross employee 10 days ago, Chief Public Affairs Officer Suzy C. DeFrancis told CNN in a telephone interview. \"I think the board acted very quickly,\" she said, adding that the woman remains in her job. About Everson, DeFrancis said, \"We're grateful for his service.\" The board of governors on Tuesday appointed Mary S. Elcano, general counsel and five-year Red Cross employee, as interim president and CEO. Everson had worked in the Bush administration from August 2001 -- including serving as commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service -- until he was hired by the Red Cross. \"This is flabbergasting, that's all I can say. It's completely contrary to his public persona that he evidenced while he was at the IRS,\" said Suzanne Ross McDowell, a Washington-based attorney who served on an advisory committee to the IRS division that deals with tax-exempt organizations. \"From the standpoint of exempt organizations on the non-profit sector, it's just another news story that we would rather not see,\" she said. \"It's got nothing to do with the Red Cross,\" said Ira Milstein, a New York lawyer specializing in corporate governance who has worked with the organization and was impressed with Everson. \"He was a team player and a good leader. To have him fall off a cliff like this is just sad.\" A search committee has been formed to begin the process of finding Everson's permanent replacement, the organization said. The job has been a challenging one. Marsha J. Evans resigned as president in 2005, after the Red Cross response to Hurricane Katrina came under fire. Four years earlier, Bernadine Healy quit the post after the organization was criticized for mishandling donations intended for victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks and collecting vast quantities of blood that was not needed and ultimately thrown out. Healy told reporters she \"had no choice\" about her resignation. Meanwhile, DeFrancis acknowledged Tuesday that, 14 years after a court ordered the agency to improve its collection of blood, it has yet to meet federal safety and quality-control requirements.

Canadian soldiers walk along a track at the Kandahar Air Base in Afghanistan last month. Most of Canada's 2,500 troops in Afghanistan are in Kandahar as part of the NATO-led mission to stabilize the war-torn country. Their presence has sparked controversy in Canada, with the Bloc Quebecois and the New Democratic Party calling for an immediate troop withdrawal. Supporters of the mission argued that Canadians have made progress in providing schools, health care and clean water for thousands of Afghans. They said the improving conditions would be impossible without troops ensuring a secure environment for aid workers and local residents. \"The military needs to be there,\" said Harold Albrecht, a conservative member of Parliament. \"The military provides the civil order we would expect from police here.\" The Canadian mission in Afghanistan was to end next February. It has claimed the lives of 80 soldiers and a diplomat, according to The Associated Press.

Earlier in the day, at least five U.S. soldiers on foot patrol were killed and three others wounded in a suicide bombing in Baghdad.

Kanan is east of Baquba, situated in the volatile Diyala province, which has been a major front for the \"surge\" of U.S.-led troops targeting militants near Baghdad. According to one of the sheik's cousins, the teen bomber went to the sheik's house Sunday to ask him for help finding her husband -- thought to be kidnapped or detained. The 18-year-old was told to return Monday, the cousin said. She returned Monday and staged the attack, killing the sheik, his 5-year-old niece and one of his security guards, police said. The attack reflects both the growing use of females as suicide bombers in Iraq and the targeting of Awakening Councils, which are also known as Concerned Citizens Groups or Sons of Iraq. The grass-roots groups, which are sometimes led by former insurgents, have drawn more than 90,000 volunteers to their ranks, military spokesman Rear Adm. Gregory said Sunday. Since November, there have been at least five attacks carried out by female suicide bombers, including a twin bombing at Baghdad pet markets last month that killed almost 100 people. Insurgent groups, particularly al Qaeda in Iraq, are increasingly using women as suicide bombers because they are less likely to be searched, the U.S. military has said. About an hour after the attack at the sheik's home, another suicide bomber approached Iraqi security forces in Muqdadiya and blew himself up as the forces began shooting at him. The blast killed two civilians and wounded 20 others, including two police officers, authorities said. Muqdadiya also is in Diyala province. In other developments: . \u2022 A suicide car bomb exploded Monday outside an upscale hotel in Sulaimaniya, killing two people and wounding at least 32 others, police said. The blast occurred at the Sulaimani Palace hotel, located in the center of the city. It is in northern Iraq's Kurdish region and is a common stop for visiting government officials, businessmen and contractors. \u2022 Two bombings in Baghdad on Monday killed an Iraqi and wounded nine others, an Interior Ministry official said. A parked car bomb exploded near an outdoor market in Shaab, a Shiite neighborhood in northeastern Baghdad, killing a civilian and wounding seven others. A roadside bomb exploded on a highway near a U.S. military patrol in eastern Baghdad, wounding two bystanders. \u2022 Coalition troops north of Baghdad killed five insurgents and detained 19 people in raids, the U.S. military said Monday. The Sunday raids were part of coalition forces' \"untiring efforts to remove al Qaeda from Iraq,\" said Lt. Col. Maura Gillen, a Multi-National Forces-Iraq spokeswoman. \u2022 Several U.S. troops may have been sickened by dirty water intended for hygiene use and supplied to bases around Iraq between 2004 and 2006, according to a Pentagon report released Monday. However, the Department of Defense inspector general's report points out that because the water was not monitored, it is impossible to tell for sure if it was dirty and if it contributed to the troops getting sick.

ICE chief Julie Myers poses with a costume contest winner at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement party. The images included several digital photos that the official had ordered erased because they were deemed to be inappropriate and offensive. At the party, Julie Myers, then-acting chief of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), part of the Department of Homeland Security, gave an award for \"most original costume\" to an employee wearing prison stripes, a wig with dreadlocks and face-darkening makeup. Immediately after posing for a photo with the winner, Myers later told Congress, she recognized that she made an error in judgment and ordered the photos deleted from the camera. Myers said she did not know the employee was wearing skin makeup, but ordered the photos destroyed because she did not think that \"recognizing an escaped prisoner in any way was beneficial to the agency's goal of treating everyone in our custody with dignity and respect.\" This week, in response to the Freedom of Information Act request filed by CNN on November 6, ICE released 113 official photographs of the party, including all of the deleted photos, which technicians were able to electronically restore. An ICE spokeswoman denied the photos were suppressed until after Myers' job was secure, saying ICE responded in an \"efficient time frame\" to the FOIA request. News of the photos' existence infuriated some members of Congress, who said they should have been made aware of them earlier. \"It is too bad that these photos surfaced too late to have dealt with her nomination, perhaps, in a different way,\" said Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, who last November put a \"hold\" on Myers' confirmation because of the hubbub.  Watch what congressmen think about party photos \u00bb . Myers was confirmed on December 20. As an assistant secretary of Homeland Security, she leads ICE, the agency charged with enforcing immigration law in the nation's interior. The agency has more than 15,000 employees, including 6,000 investigators. McCaskill said she believed the photos would have affected the confirmation. \"This is such brutally bad judgment that, to me, it indicates that the leadership of this division is flawed,\" she said. Rep. Bennie Thompson, whose committee oversees ICE, said Wednesday he is upset both by the photos and by ICE's failure to give the photos to Congress in November. \"I was satisfied [with Myers' explanations and apology] until I found out that these pictures existed,\" Thompson said. An ICE spokeswoman denied that there was any intentional effort to mislead Congress. \"We had asked that they be destroyed, and as far as we knew, that was the case,\" spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. Myers was \"frank and honest about every aspect of that situation from the very beginning,\" she said. An estimated 50 to 75 employees attended the October 31 costume party at ICE headquarters in the District of Columbia. A poster advertising the contest said costumes should be tasteful and \"office appropriate.\" Myers declined to talk to CNN Wednesday, but in written comments to Congress last November, she offered the following account of the incident: . She and two other ICE officials served as judges of the costume contest, and she had \"very limited interaction\" with the employee in the prisoner costume, who \"was present at the [judging] table for less than half a minute before he moved on. \"I was not aware at the time of the contest that the employee disguised his skin color,\" she wrote. Nonetheless, after posing for a photo with the employee, she realized it was inappropriate. \"Although I did not know that this individual had disguised his race, I determined that I had made an error in judgment in recognizing an escaped prisoner at this party,\" she wrote, and she instructed her chief of staff to direct the official photographer to delete the photos. In an internal e-mail that was sent at 3:05 p.m., shortly after the party was to end, the ICE public affairs director, Wendy Burrell, said, \"Please make sure that the photos of the most creative (single male entry) are destroyed. They may not be used in any publication, Web site, compilation disk, you name it. Not just not used. Please erase all.\" Myers said she was \"shocked and horrified\" to learn the next day that the employee had used skin-darkening makeup. The employee was counseled, and Myers sent out a note to all agency employees expressing regret over the event, agency spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said in November. \"It is now clear that, however unintended, a few of the costumes were inappropriate and offensive,\" Myers wrote. She reminded employees of their responsibility to complete diversity training and said managers should distribute and discuss ICE's diversity policy statement during staff meetings. The employee who donned the inmate costume was placed on two weeks of administrative leave, counseled by a supervisor and returned to full duty.

Lafayette Police Sgt. Billy Soileau carries Ke'Iveion Solomon 2, as he helps evacuate children Saturday. \"Hazmat says that clean up is moving quickly and on track,\" Lafayette police said Sunday in a statement. Two train cars leaked highly corrosive hydrochloric acid after the six-car train jumped the tracks Saturday about 2:30 a.m. CT (3:30 a.m. ET), according to police. The chemical spill caused a toxic cloud to form above the site. Lafayette authorities evacuated about 3,500 homes and businesses -- including a nursing home -- within a mile of the derailment location.  Watch traffic detoured from cloud \u00bb . The Red Cross opened a shelter at Carencro High School for residents to stay Saturday night, while another 40 to 50 families were put up at hotel rooms, police said. Residents will be allowed to return home once the spill is contained and no longer dangerous, said Joe Faust, a spokesman for BNSF Railway, which operates the train cars. Hydrochloric acid is a clear, colorless solution of hydrogen chloride in water often used in metal cleaning and electroplating. Exposure to it can irritate the skin, said Lt. Craig Stansbury of the Lafayette Parish Sheriff's Office. People exposed to the substance are urged to seek medical attention. Residents outside the evacuation area were advised to close windows and doors and turn off air conditioning to avoid any contamination.

How do you navigate the minefields of huge portions, hidden fats, and sky-high sodium levels? Olive Garden's Venetian Apricot Chicken has 448 calories and 11 grams of fat. You shouldn't have to resign yourself to paying for restaurant meals with a future cardiac risk. You just need to know where to go to find healthy, fresh food. To that end, we went out into the world of sit-down restaurants, looking to separate the (whole) wheat from the chaff. Backed by an advisory panel of experts in healthy dining, we sifted through 43 chains with more than 75 locations across the country and, frankly, were astonished by how many restaurants made no nutritional information available. Health.com: Meet Health's experts . But judge we did those brave (and progressive) enough to share their numbers. What you hold in your hands are the 10 that stood at the top of the heap. Uno's Chicago Grill . If you haven't been to your local Uno's recently, you're in for a great surprise. Sure, its famous deep-dish (read high-fat) pizzas still hold court, but nutrition has become the word of the day with a completely transfat-free menu and plenty of grilled entrees (including antibiotic-free chicken). Adding to the healthy variety: whole-grain pasta and brown rice, organic coffee and tea, and flatbread pizzas that have half the calories of deep-dish ones. Plus, you can add a salad to your pizza for half-price because, according to the menu, \"We want you to get some greens in your diet.\" Now that's a blue-ribbon commitment to health. Another reason Uno's is at the top of our list: You know what you're eating. In the lobbies of most of the restaurant's locations, there are Nutrition Information Centers that detail ingredients, fat and sodium contents, and calories and fiber of every item, in addition to gluten-free options.  Dr. Sanjay Gupta takes a look at Health magazine's restaurant choices \u00bb . \u2022 Danger zone: Deep-dish pizzas can pile on the fat. \u2022 We love: The Penne Bolognese -- just 16 grams of fat (well within the daily recommended max of 65 grams of fat for a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet). Souplantation & Sweet Tomatoes . Can a buffet-style restaurant -- that symbol of American overindulgence --possibly be one of the healthiest restaurants in the country? It can in this case, because this salad-soup-and-bakery eatery (Southern California locations are named Souplantation, everywhere else they're called Sweet Tomatoes) uses produce so fresh that it's guaranteed to have been \"in the ground\" 24 hours before it's in a refrigerated truck on its way to the restaurant. At the salad bar you'll find seasonal vegetables like squash and bell peppers, freshly tossed and prepared salads, and a great range of nonfat dressings. San Marino Spinach With Pumpkin Seeds and Cranberries, anyone? This is paradise for vegetarians, vegans, and anyone who's looking for a low-sodium, low-fat, high-nutrient meal outside the home. \u2022 Danger zone: Plate overload -- after all, it's all-you-can-eat. \u2022 We love: The Tomato Spinach Whole Wheat pasta, a delicious combo of whole grains and veggies. Mimi's Cafe . This cozy caf\u00e9-style restaurant transforms normally less-than-healthy foods into better -- and still tasty -- options: a half-pound cheeseburger wrapped in lettuce (that's right, no bun); the cutely named Naked French Market Onion Soup, served without cheese. Another thing to love is the way that Mimi's clearly steers you toward its healthy options. Its \"Lifestyle Menu\" points you to low-carb picks like the fish of the day served with fresh steamed veggies. Also, Mimi's keeps portions small, so you can get away with occasionally having one of their more indulgent entrees like the Sweet & Sour Coconut Shrimp (608 calories). Health.com: Healthiest fast-food restaurants . \u2022 Danger zone: The \"Comfort Classics\" page of the menu, with throwbacks like rich (super-high-fat) Chicken Cordon Bleu. \u2022 We love: Chicken & Fruit -- grilled chicken and a garden salad, plus wedges of fresh orange, honeydew, watermelon, and cantaloupe. P.F. Chang's China Bistro . Take the best aspects of Asian cuisine -- a combination of fresh vegetables and protein -- surround them with healthy influences such as whole-grain brown rice, wild-caught, sustainable Alaskan salmon, and all-natural chicken, and you have a recipe for delicious, healthy dining. Wok-based cooking (which requires less oil) using soybean oil keeps fat contents low, and less sodium in the sauces rounds out  P.F. Chang's healthy take on Chinese food. Special credit goes to their nutritional information being based on the whole entr\u00e9e, not a single serving like at most places. Health.com: Eat out, without gaining a pound . \u2022 Danger zone: Traditional, fat-dense items such as Lo Mein Beef. \u2022 We love: Carb-free vegetarian lettuce wraps -- wok-seared tofu, red onions, and water chestnuts with mint and lime, set in lettuce cups. Bob Evans Restaurants . You wouldn't think a restaurant that prides itself on sausage could muscle its way into the top five healthiest restaurants in the country. But Bob Evans scores high on its dinner menu, which has plenty of low-carb, low-fat entrees and alternatives for children and adults (chicken tenders that are grilled instead of fried, potato-crusted flounder, and salmon stir-fry). Look for sides like steamed broccoli florets and fresh fruit, and enjoy old-fashioned family meals in a modern, nutrition-forward way. \u2022 Danger zone: Breakfast, where bacon and sausage are kings. \u2022 We love: Healthy options on the kid's menu, like slow-roasted turkey with mashed potatoes and glazed baby carrots, and fruit and yogurt dippers for dessert. Ruby Tuesday . If we'd done this survey in 2004, Ruby Tuesday might have won the blue ribbon for printing all its nutritional content right on the menu. It was revolutionary, and, frankly, it didn't last. But the healthy ethos survived in the chain's ingredients: organic greens, hormone-free chicken, transfat-free frying oil, and better-for-you beverages including Jones organic teas and made-to-order drinks like all natural lemonades (think real fruit and juice). It's easy to find the good stuff -- it's highlighted -- and the offerings range from a chicken wrap in a whole-wheat tortilla to broiled tilapia. Health.com: The best independent restaurants . \u2022 Danger zone: Comfort-food entrees like Gourmet Chicken Potpie, which piles more than half your daily calories on the plate. \u2022 We love: That they've even healthied-up the burgers, offering veggie-and turkey-versions. Romano's Macaroni Grill . This Italian eatery puts its entire menu's nutritional content online, so you know before you go what to steer clear of -- mainly, the massive baked pastas. But what pushed Macaroni Grill onto our best list is its \"Sensible Fare\" menu, with entrees like Simple Salmon, a grilled fillet sided by grilled asparagus and broccoli. Grazie for whole-wheat penne available as a substitute in any dish. And bravo for including a grilled skinless chicken breast with steamed broccoli and pasta on the kid's menu. \u2022 Danger zone: Heavy entrees like spaghetti and meatballs with meat sauce. \u2022 We love: The delicious Italian sorbetto and biscotti: just 330 calories and 4 grams of fat. Chevy's Fresh Mex . Chevy's makes a big deal out of the \"fresh\" in its name, and with good reason -- no cans in the restaurant, fresh salsa blended every hour, fresh avocados smashed every day for guacamole, and watch-them-made tortillas. All oils are trans fat-free, and the Mexican-style fare has lots of healthy options including Grilled Fish Tacos. Health.com: America's not-so-healthiest restaurants . \u2022 Danger zone: Sodium counts. To get below 1,000 milligrams, you'll need to get those Chicken Fajitas with no tortillas, tomalito, rice, sour cream, or guacamole. \u2022 We love: Fresh fish of the day, grilled and served on a skillet with homemade salsa. Olive Garden . Like Macaroni Grill, this Italian eatery has great-for-you options, as long as you keep your wits about you (again, avoid the baked pastas!). Use the olive-branch icon on the menu to find low-fat \"Garden Fare\" items such as Venetian Apricot Chicken. Even the fries aren't a disaster, because they're done in trans fat-free oil. You can grab some whole-grain goodness, too, by choosing the whole-wheat linguine at dinner as a substitute for any pasta. \u2022 Danger zone: The non-olive-branch entrees. Olive Garden provides no nutritional information on anything else on the menu. \u2022 We love: The low-fat Capellini Pomodoro (644 calories and 14 grams fat). Denny's . Yes, the home of the Lumberjack Slam and Moons Over My Hammy offers lots of skinny options to counter its fatty mainstays. \"Fit-Fare\" dishes such as the grilled-chicken-breast salad, and tilapia with rice and veggies, each have less than 15 grams of fat. Denny's also posts full nutritional information on its Web site. Its use of trans fats to cook its French fries kept it from landing higher on our list, but the rest of the fried food is trans fat-free. \u2022 Danger zone: Breakfast specials, especially the Meat Lover's Scramble, which is as bad for you as it sounds. \u2022 We love: The online nutritional chart has Weight Watchers Food Exchange Values.

Iraqi Sadrists march Friday in the Najaf funeral procession of Sayyed Riyadh al-Nuri, top aide to Muqtada al-Sadr. Witnesses and media in the heavily Shiite Baghdad neighborhood of Sadr City, home to the cleric's power base in the capital, reported heavy fighting between U.S.-backed Iraqi troops and al-Sadr's Mehdi Army militia. The witnesses said U.S. aircraft had been bombarding the area for hours, and media reported rockets slamming into houses and many casualties. Witnesses and al-Sadr's office said mosques were making loudspeaker announcements about Mehdi Army attacks on U.S. military armored vehicles. U.S. troops working in support of Iraqi soldiers killed two snipers, two other men firing rocket-propelled grenades and \"multiple others from a nearby building where soldiers were taking RPG and machine gun fire,\" the U.S. military said in a statement. At the same time -- about 9 p.m. -- at least six roadside bombs damaged vehicles in a U.S. Army convoy that was transporting barriers for a group of Iraqi Army soldiers establishing a checkpoint, the military said. Afterward, the military said, the Iraqi and U.S. soldiers were attacked by small-arms, machine-gun and RPG fire from buildings overlooking the road. The soldiers fired back at their attackers, killing at least four of them. More explosions from the buildings indicated possible arms and munitions stored there, the military said. But the small-arms attack continued until the U.S. forces fired two rounds from an M1A2 Abrams tank, killing two more attackers. Not long afterward, the U.S. Air Force, operating an unmanned aerial vehicle, fired a Hellfire missile at three men spotted setting roadside bombs, killing all three. Maj. John Gossart, executive officer of the American unit involved, said that no U.S. or Iraqi troops were seriously hurt. Earlier, al-Sadr issued remarks about the killing of Sayyed Riyadh al-Nuri, who was shot outside his house in Najaf's Adala neighborhood after returning from Friday prayers. \"The hands of the occupiers and their collaborators have treacherously reached our beloved martyr Sayyed Riyadh al-Nuri,\" al-Sadr wrote in a statement on the Web. Al-Nuri is one of 17 people killed over 24 hours in airstrikes, fighting and attacks in areas wracked in recent weeks by fighting among Shiites. The assassination prompted an immediate vehicle ban in the Shiite holy city of Najaf, anger among mourners and an intensification of fighting in Baghdad's Sadr City neighborhood. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki issued a statement deploring the killing and ordering an investigation. Al-Sadr issued remarks about the killing in a statement on a Web site. Spokesman Sheikh Salah al-Obeidi emphasized that the cleric is not accusing anyone in particular of the killing but believes that the killers \"are the ones who are following the occupiers' steps and don't want stability for the country.\" But al-Obeidi called the killing an \"act of provocation\" after the \"siege of Sadr City.\" He was referring to the battles since Sunday involving members of al-Sadr's Mehdi Army militia and Iraqi security forces dominated by a rival Shiite political movement, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. That fighting started with an offensive in Basra and spread to other Shiite regions, including Sadr City and the Babil provincial capital of Hilla. The al-Nuri assassination prompted officials to expand the daily curfew in Hilla. Police said a ban on all outside movement that usually begins at 11 p.m. and ends at 8 a.m. will instead start at 8:30 p.m. Violence continued Friday in several places in Iraq. Suicide bombings killed at least four people -- three of them police -- and wounded 15, officials said. The first bombing was in Ramadi, the provincial capital of the predominantly Sunni Anbar province west of Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official said. At least three national police officers were killed and five wounded, the official said. The second attack took place at a checkpoint about 20 km (12 miles) north of Baiji, according to police, who said the bomber and one other person were killed and 10 were wounded. The casualties were members of a local Awakening Council who were manning the checkpoint, police said. The suicide bomber was driving a pickup carrying sheep. Awakening Councils, or Sons of Iraq, are made up of Sunnis who have turned on al Qaeda in Iraq. Also, at least three people were killed and five wounded in a mortar attack on Baghdad's Palestine Hotel, an Interior Ministry official said. The Palestine Hotel -- across the Tigris River from the International Zone, the heavily guarded seat of U.S. power in Baghdad -- is in the path of many of the rockets and mortars aimed at the zone. The U.S. military has blamed Iranian-backed Shiite militants for recent mortar and rocket attacks in Baghdad and International Zone, also known as the Green Zone. Unmanned aerial vehicles targeted and killed six suspected insurgents in Basra on Friday and six \"heavily armed criminals\" in northeastern Baghdad on Thursday night, the U.S. military said.  Watch the Baghdad drone attack \u00bb . The U.S. and Iraqi militaries have consistently said they have not been targeting specific groups in their recent battles in Shiite areas. Iraqi and U.S. government officials say they differentiate between Mehdi Army members obeying al-Sadr's seven-month cease-fire pledge and \"gangs,\" \"criminals\" or \"outlaws\" who aren't obeying al-Sadr's orders. The intra-Shiite fighting in Iraq that has killed hundreds of people in the past two weeks has involved two main movements: members of the Mehdi Army militia loyal to al-Sadr, and Iraqi security forces dominated by the chief political rival of the Sadrists, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. Many of those security forces had been integrated into police and army units from the council's Badr Brigade militia. E-mail to a friend .

Afghan policemen stand Wednesday outside the ruins of a house destroyed during clashes with Taliban insurgents. \"The Taliban-led insurgency remained a capable, determined, and resilient threat to stability and to the expansion of government authority, particularly in the Pashtun south and east,\" according to the \"Country Reports on Terrorism 2007.\" The Taliban's information operations have become \"increasingly aggressive and sophisticated,\" and their ability to obtain al Qaeda support and recruit soldiers from the Taliban base of rural Pashtuns is \"undiminished,\" the report says. But new civilian-military counterinsurgency approaches in the east, particularly Nangarhar, have begun to yield successes, the report says. The Taliban is funding its terror activities with money from supporters in neighboring Pakistan and from narcotics trafficking and kidnappings. Kidnappings of foreigners have increased, the report says. The group also has increased its use of improvised explosive devices, and suicide bombings have become more frequent and more deadly, it says. Quoting U.N.-compiled figures, the State Department said terrorists launched about 140 suicide-bomb attacks in 2007. The number of terror attacks in Afghanistan increased from 969 in 2006 to 1,127 last year, and the number of people killed, injured or kidnapped as the result of terrorism rose from 3,557 in 2006 to 4,673 in 2007, the report says. In the face of attacks by the Taliban and related groups on coalition forces and others, Afghanistan has struggled to build a stable, democratic government. However, it has taken steps to build strong relationships with neighboring Pakistan and address problems such as poverty that help fuel terrorism, the report says. The Program for Strengthening Peace and Reconciliation has persuaded more than 5,000 Taliban members and other insurgents to stop their lives of violence, it says. The shifting situation in Afghanistan prompted the top U.S. military officer to say in early April that he is \"deeply concerned\" about the situation there, and that maintaining troops in Iraq is harming overall U.S. military capabilities. \"The Taliban is growing bolder, suicide attacks are on the rise, and so is the trade in illegal narcotics,\" said Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the United States needs more troops to hold areas of southern Afghanistan -- the region of highest concern -- and to train local army and police personnel. The two men testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee. The United States recently sent an additional 3,500 troops to Afghanistan, but commanders in the region would like 10,000 to 12,000 more, Gates said. He said he doubted NATO would make up the difference. Although 25 NATO allies and 13 other countries have contributed forces, the bulk of the recent fighting in Afghanistan has been done by U.S., Canadian, British and Dutch troops. Canadian troops are based in the southern province of Kandahar, once a Taliban stronghold.

And he certainly knows a thing or two about building a brand. Tony Fernandes, CEO of Air Asia, spoke to CNN's Andrew Stevens in The Boardroom. In just five years, Tony Fernandes has built Air Asia from a bankrupt local carrier to the region's biggest budget airline -- 18 million passengers will fly the airline this year. CNN's Andrew Stevens talked to Fernandes in Macau to find out why, at the age of 37, he would leave a comfortable job in the music industry to start a new business in the cut-throat, not to mention high risk, aviation industry. Fernandes: Well there's a fine line between brilliance and stupidity, so the second point in a statement that Richard Branson's made is how to become a millionaire, start with a billion and start an airline. Now I was the other way around, I didn't have a billion. So I think that was one of the things, that I didn't have a lot to lose. And I thought I was young enough. I got tired of the corporate life, I got tired of corporate politics. And I saw a business opportunity. Everyone likes to fly. And I think the key number that got me going was only six percent of Malaysians flew. I started looking at the prices of tickets, and to travel from one part of Malaysia to another it was almost someone's one month salary. So that drove me. But I didn't want to be there, you know, at 55, and say I should've done it. Life is about risks, life is about not being afraid to fail. Stevens: But at the time, airlines were going into bankruptcy, oil prices were going through the roof, people were too scared to fly globally, didn't you think, \"oh my god I've made the worse decision of my life?\" Fernandes: No, I knew Malaysians very well. You put a price low enough, they'd risk their lives. I think also when you start a business the most important thing is does the market want it. And I knew the market wanted it. If that's there, everything is surmountable because people power is strong. Stevens: You like to pluck people from all different walks of life, from all different professions. How do you meld them all together? What's the philosophy underlying this? Fernandes: Well I think, first is that everyone plays a part. There is no hierarchy. Everyone is valuable. I make all my senior management carry bags and things so they appreciate that. Stevens: Do they? Fernandes: Oh yes, they do. Some try to shirk their duties, but it's very hard when they see the CEO doing it -- they have to do it. The second is that everyone's got ability, it's how you bring the best out of them. And that's a very motivating thing. If you see someone who's carrying a bag suddenly flying a plane. That's a very powerful motivator. You can do all the theory and books and promise people the world but when they see it in reality, boy that's a powerful thing to see. Stevens: When Air Asia started, you were known to go down, roll up your sleeves, and really get in with your staff at all levels, do you still have time to do that? Fernandes: I have less time, but I still do it. I think it's fundamental to running my company, because, unless you get down to the floor and see what's happening, you won't make effective decisions. I do it for two reasons. One is, to see what's going on, and to make sure if I'm making the right decisions. And the second thing is, I still want to discover these raw diamonds. Stevens: What's the best piece of business advice you've ever been given? Fernandes: Focus and discipline. Stay focused and disciplined. Stick to a plan, stick to a vision. You change but the vision's still the same. And that came from Conor McCarthy of RyanAir. He has taught me about discipline and focus and I think that's been a really good lesson for me.

Joran van der Sloot awaits transfer from the Netherlands to Aruba in November. He later was released. It happened less than a week after a Dutch television program aired video footage showing the young man saying he was with the missing Alabama teenager when she died. During the two-hour interview with Aruban investigators, van der Sloot again denied any role in Holloway's vanishing, the prosecutor's office said in a written statement. Van der Sloot said that he was under the influence of marijuana when he was secretly videotaped saying that he was with Holloway when she died, and that he arranged for a friend to dump her body in the ocean, the statement said. On the video, which aired Sunday, van der Sloot also says that he wasn't sure Holloway was dead before a friend disposed of her body. Patrick van der Eem, a man who feigned friendliness toward van der Sloot, recorded the conversations on hidden cameras installed in the Range Rover he was driving, according to the report that aired Sunday.  Watch how the video has renewed interest in the case \u00bb . Shortly after the video was made public, an investigative judge said that enough evidence exists to reopen the inquiry against the Dutch college student, but denied a prosecution's request that van der Sloot be detained. Hans Mos, the Aruban prosecutor, is appealing that decision, and a three-judge panel will rule on it \"after this weekend,\" Mos said.  Watch Holloway's father say van der Sloot should 'come clean' \u00bb . Earlier this week, Dutch authorities executed several search warrants at van der Sloot's current and former residences, a source close to the investigation said. They took a hard drive and a laptop computer, the source said. Van der Sloot's attorney, Joe Tacopina, told CNN that the video did not show a \"confession\" and said that van der Sloot is innocent. The college student is willing to answer \"any questions\" investigators ask, Tacopina said. Earlier this week, he told ABC that much of what was on the video is \"easily disprovable based on corroborative evidence. ... The fact of the matter is he still is not responsible. The evidence -- not Joran, the evidence -- says he's not responsible for Natalee's death.\" Holloway, 18, was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad, Aruba, nightclub with van der Sloot, Deepak Kalpoe and his brother, Satish. Mos dropped charges against the three men in December, saying he couldn't be sure of a conviction.  See a timeline of the case \u00bb . Holloway was visiting Aruba with about 100 classmates celebrating their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama. Holloway failed to show up for her flight home the following day, and her packed bags were found in her hotel room. E-mail to a friend .

Protesters turned out in March after the rape allegations surfaced. The Marine pleaded guilty to charges Friday. Staff. Sgt. Tyrone L. Hadnott was sentenced to four years of confinement, said First Lt. Judd Wilson, a Marine spokesman in Okinawa, Japan. The Marine Corps withdrew several other charges, including rape of a child, kidnapping and making a false official statement, Wilson said. Japanese police arrested Hadnott in February on charges alleging that he raped a 14-year-old junior-high school student. He saw her while riding his motorcycle, offered to give her a ride and later assaulted her at a park, the police said then. The case stirred outrage at the highest levels of the Japanese government. Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda deplored the incident as \"unforgivable.\" The Japanese Foreign Ministry lodged an official protest with the U.S. government. And Okinawa Gov. Hirokazu Nakaima said the offense \"violates the rights of women\" and that \"this is a crime that we should not accept.\" The Japanese authorities released Hadnott after the girl withdrew her allegations, but the Marine Corps conducted its own investigation. The Marines charged Hadnott with rape of a child, abusive sexual contact, making a false official statement, adultery and kidnapping. More than 40,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan, most of them on Okinawa. The U.S. military presence has at times bred resentment among locals, who have long complained about crime, noise and accidents. Anti-American sentiments boiled over in 1995, after three American servicemen kidnapped and gang-raped a 12-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl. Two years ago, a U.S. civilian military employee was jailed for nine years for raping two women. The Marine Corps said in a statement on Friday that it does not tolerate sexual assault. \"We remain committed to maintaining an environment that rejects sexual assault and attitudes that promote such behaviors,\" the statement said.", "dc7f4527bf654918c7a4bb19179949ecd5982c0f": "(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo missed an early penalty as Manchester United earned a 0-0 draw in the first leg of the Champions League semifinal at Barcelona's Nou Camp stadium on Wednesday night. Cristiano Ronaldo sent his penalty attempt wide as United failed to take an early lead at the Nou Camp. The Portugal winger, the top scorer in this season's competition, spurned the chance to net for the 39th time overall this campaign and give United a vital away goal. The 23-year-old hit the stanchion high outside goalkeeper Victor Valdes' left-hand post in the third minute after Gabriel Milito handled his header from a Paul Scholes corner. It was United's best chance in a game dominated by the home side, who had the best of possession with some silky moves but failed to find the killer pass in the final third of the pitch. United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar made a string of saves, especially in the second half, but was not often seriously tested. Barcelona were boosted by the return of Argentina forward Lionel Messi, who started alongside Samuel Eto'o up front, with Thierry Henry on the bench after also being cleared following an illness. Messi picked out Samuel Eto'o in the 13th minute only for midfielder Scholes -- making his 100th Champions League appearance -- to make a vital interception. Barcelona pressed forward again in the 21st minute and Rafael Marquez got clear of his marker but his header failed to trouble Van der Sar, who was back in the side following a groin injury. Then Yaya Toure showed good skill for the home side and sent a good cross into the area that was turned away by Van der Sar. Ronaldo felt he should have had another penalty in the 30th minute when he was bundled over by Marquez after Xavi had carelessly lost possession, but Swiss referee Massimo Busacca allowed play to continue. Eto'o rattled in a shot after 34 minutes but Wes Brown -- who passed a late fitness test to replace the ill Nemanja Vidic in central defense -- made a vital block. Brown partnered Rio Ferdinand, with England midfielder Owen Hargreaves operating as a makeshift right-back. Deco, starting his first game for Barcelona after two months out with injuries, then failed to test Van der Sar with a free-kick in the 38th minute. Marquez was booked in the 44th minute after tripping Ronaldo as he attempted to surge forward, meaning the Mexican is suspended for next Tuesday's second leg at Old Trafford. Ronaldo sent his effort from an acute angle wide of the post. After the break, Messi saw his effort blocked in the 47th minute and then Van der Sar tipped over defender Gianluca Zambrotta's long-range effort. Messi beat three United players but Ferdinand cut out his low cross from the right, then he played in a superb ball for Eto'o -- who lashed his shot against the side-netting. Deco tested Van der Sar with a low drive, then the Dutchman easily dealt with a 20-yard effort from Xavi. Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard took off Messi in the 62nd minute, replacing him with teenager Bojan Krkic, who scored the winner in the first leg of the quarterfinal against Schalke. A foul on the Serbian-born Spaniard drew a yellow card for Hargreaves in the 73rd minute, then United boss Alex Ferguson bolstered his midfield by bringing on Nani for England forward Wayne Rooney -- who had started up front with Carlos Tevez. Rijkaard responded by replacing Deco with Henry in the 77th minute, and the French forward forced a scrambled save by Van der Sar with a long-range shot on 83. Ferguson brought on veteran winger Ryan Giggs for Tevez soon after, then Van der Sar denied Andres Iniesta and also dived to comfortably save Henry's free-kick from 35 yards. Barcelona continued to press until the final whistle, but still could not create a clear-cut opportunity.

There must be dialogue.\" Nelly Avila Moreno, center, alias Karina, is escorted by soldiers after surrendering. Nelly Avila Moreno, 45, whose nom de guerre was Karina, said she and her longtime male companion made the decision jointly to abandon the FARC group, based in the jungle, at 5 a.m. Sunday. She said pressure from Colombian soldiers had been key to their decision, and she called on her fellow rebels to follow her example. \"I invite them to change the sensibility that is among the guerrillas,\" she said, seated by her companion, who said nothing during the news conference. She also had a message for the Colombian people: \"It is important to do something for peace in Colombia, and that need to do something is precisely one of my motivations.\" After 24 years with the FARC, Karina said she wants to reintegrate with society. \"At this moment, what I am thinking about is reuniting with my family and with all of society,\" she said. Karina said she had had no contact with the group's leaders for the past two years. During that time, she said, \"I was trying to stay alive.\" She said she knows nothing about the group's leaders, because \"everything in the FARC is very compartmentalized.\" Still, she did hear through the news media about the killing by another member of FARC of Ivan Rios, a member of the group's central high command. \"We suffered a very strong blow,\" she said. She acknowledged that news led her to worry about the possibility that one of her fellow guerrillas might consider doing the same thing to her. \"A person has a lot of combatants alongside, but you don't know what each one is thinking,\" she said. Asked about news reports of guerrilla operations she may have participated in, Karina admitted to nothing. \"They accuse me of a lot of things I wasn't part of,\" she said. But Miguel Antonio Paez told CNN en Espanol that he remembers well the woman who, with a band of guerrillas, stopped the bus he was on in 2004 in northwest Colombia, ordered him and the other passengers off and the bus be burned. \"The commander of that guerrilla group -- a dark-haired woman, tall, with one eye missing -- called herself Karina,\" he said. \"She ordered me tied up. Here, I have the marks from the wires, and there, while I was tied up, she lopped off my penis and testicles and I remained castrated for all my life.\" Asked specifically about the killing of the father of President Alvaro Uribe in 1983, she said she did not know who carried out the act, and added, \"I don't have my hands stained in that deed.\" She said that with her surrender have come new fears about possible retribution from FARC loyalists, who consider her a traitor. Wearing a red sweatshirt and what appeared to be a diamond earring in her left ear, she said she once believed the FARC would rule Colombia. \"I once dreamed of that,\" she said. Gen. Mario Montoya, chief of the army, said two Colombian air force helicopters were sent Sunday to pick up Karina and her companion, who had given authorities their general location. \"With this, we have given a confounding strike to the FARC structure,\" particularly to Front 47, which at this point is practically dismantled,\" he said. Since the killing of Rios, 45 members of the group have laid down their arms and accepted a government plan for reinstallation into society, he said. \"We want to send a message to all members of FARC who persist in the mountains,\" he said. \"To tell them, what Karina has done is the road all the members of FARC should go down. If they don't, we are going to continue combating them. Today, more than ever, I invite them to lay down their arms, take the plan. We don't want them dead. We want them alive.\"", "e0953e2de7cf286ac1d87a41c62e37f21b7c7564": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Al Qaeda is still operating within Pakistan's mountainous tribal region bordering Afghanistan, and the United States lacks a \"comprehensive\" plan for meeting its national security goals there, said a U.S. government study released Thursday. A Pakistani policeman watches over a border area in February 2008. Despite the United States providing $10.5 billion in military and economic aid to Pakistan, a key U.S. ally, the Government Accountability Office said it \"found broad agreement ... that al Qaeda had regenerated its ability to attack the United States and had succeeded in establishing a safe haven\" in Pakistan's Federally Administrated Tribal Areas. Of the $10.5 billion in U.S. aid, more than half -- $5.8 billion -- was specifically provided for the tribal region, the GAO said. Furthermore, the report said, \"No comprehensive plan for meeting U.S. national security goals in FATA has been developed, as stipulated by the National Security Strategy for Combating Terrorism [in 2003], called for by an independent commission [in 2004] and mandated by congressional legislation [in 2007].\" \"Our report does not state that the U.S. lacks agency-specific plans; rather, we found that there was no comprehensive plan that integrated the combined capabilities of Defense, State, USAID [U.S. Agency for International Development], the intelligence community,\" GAO said. After the September 11 terrorist attacks, U.S. officials said intelligence indicated that Osama bin Laden and other senior al Qaeda leaders, who had been based in Afghanistan before the attacks on New York and Washington, were operating in the tribal region. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has denied that claim and has said that U.S. military missions there would violate Pakistan's sovereignty. So, since 2002, the United States has \"relied principally on the Pakistan military to address U.S. national security goals\" in that region, the GAO report said. Of the $5.8 billion the United States provided for aid in the tribal region, 96 percent of it reimbursed Pakistan for military operations there, the agency said. Two of the eight lawmakers who commissioned the GAO report, Democratic Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Menendez of New Jersey, said it indicated a failing on the part of the Bush administration. \"The Bush administration has had six years to come up with a plan to get Osama bin Laden and his group, but it is still flying by the seat of its pants,\" Menendez said in a statement. \"We've dumped 10 billion American taxpayer dollars into Pakistan with the expectation that the terrorists will be hunted down and smoked out, but al Qaeda has been allowed to rejuvenate in the area that is supposed to be locked down,\" he said. Harkin called the report's findings \"appalling.\" \"The White House must propose a strategic policy in this area and follow it, especially when we have this new opportunity to forge a fresh strategic relationship with the new civilian government in Pakistan,\" he said in a statement. The Defense Department said it agreed with the report's findings, according to letters attached at the end of the GAO report, but the State Department disagreed with them, saying there was a comprehensive plan in place. A letter from Kathleen Turner, a spokeswoman for the office of the Director of National Intelligence, said that office and the National Counterterrorism Center concurred with the report's assessment that the United States has not met its national security goals in the tribal region but maintained that there was a plan in place. USAID said that it generally agreed with the report's recommendation for a comprehensive plan but that work in the tribal areas should be guided by the Pakistani government's own FATA Sustainable Development Plan from 2006.

A man tries out the Wii Fit at a Nintendo launch party in Central Park, New York City. Wii Fit doesn't try to motivate you with before and after photos. It doesn't try to motivate you with testimonials from fitness gurus. It doesn't even offer you three easy payments. But it does entice you to get into shape by making working out look like fun. And that it does very well. In fact, Wii Fit might be some of the most fun you can have by just more or less standing still, which must make it about as mass market friendly as any video game product ever was. Wii Fit requires a Wii, of course, and it comes bundled with a balance board. But the entire setup doesn't take up much space, and the board is no eyesore, either. Unlike a bathroom scale that's usually squirreled away in a closet or shoved into the corner of a bathroom, looking at it doesn't make you feel guilty. Designed to fit in with Japanese living rooms, where space is usually at a premium, the balance board is sleek and elegantly designed. iReport.com: Send us your Wii Fit review . It conveys cool Asian style with a streamlined appearance. It's something you wouldn't mind having in your living room at all. One thing about Nintendo: They know how to make hardware that's rugged but easy on the eyes. Getting started with Wii Fit is a snap, but you might have to get some bad news out of the way first. The balance board connects to the Wii through a Wi-Fi connection. You stand on it and use the Wii remote to record your height and age. The balance board then registers your weight. From those figures, Wii Fit calculates your body mass index (BMI), a standard metric many doctors use to determine a person's overall fitness, which you can track over time. Oddly, however, there's no easy way to just use the scale to see your weight without recalculating your BMI each time. The Wii Fit-ness program is organized into 48 activities divided among four general areas: yoga, aerobics, strength training, and balance games. You can choose to work through all four in one session or just concentrate on one. If you've never tried yoga before, working through the 15 positions here are as good an introduction as any. All of them are done with at least one foot on the balance board, so Wii Fit can measure how centered you keep your body. Yoga is a great way to stretch muscles and joints out and to work on overall flexibility. As meditative as this physical activity would seem, you'll feel the burn even before you reach any of the advanced forms. Once you're loosened up a little with yoga, you might move on to aerobics. The majority of these nine activities are basically variations of hula hooping, jogging in place, and simple step aerobics. The one exception is rhythm boxing, which you unlock later on. By turning these aerobic challenges all into minigames, Wii Fit entices you to keep working on them to earn better scores and ratings. With the hula hoop, for example, you have to stand on the board and grind your hips to keep a virtual hoop twirling. Later, you have to \"catch\" tossed hoops, and then keep them all twirling, too. Wii Fit sets a mellow, steady pace for all its aerobic challenges, but it still manages to make your heart pump. If just the words \"push\" and \"ups\" makes you break out in a sweat, then you've probably already surmised that strength training contains some of the most physically demanding Wii Fit workouts. The torso twist and rowing squat are easy, but push-ups, planks, and even the lunges will show you what you're made of. The push-ups in particular make you work extra hard. You do push-ups with your two hands on the board, but because it's 17 \u00bd inches wide, people over six feet tall or with broad shoulders might find themselves with their hands positioned inside their shoulder width. While it's certainly a worthwhile goal to build up to, it's difficult to snap off a set of push-ups from that position. The balance games require you to just apply pressure to the board through your feet. Skiing slaloms and ski jumping are fairly straightforward, but you can also walk a tightrope or try to float down a river inside a giant bubble. All of these are simple and fun, and they really do make you aware of how well you maintain good posture and keep your balance. However, they are also short and very limited in the variety of levels and layouts. Could you do all these exercises and balance activities right now without Wii Fit? Sure you could. But would you? That's where the Wii Fit balance board comes in. Just like the Wii itself, it just looks like something you'd like to try out. But once you take that first step onto it, you might find yourself on the way to becoming more fit. READ about video games. WATCH video game news.

Indian women mourn the death of their relatives in the May 13 serial blasts in Jaipur. Vasundhara Raje, chief minister of Rajasthan -- the state of which Jaipur is the capital -- blamed an \"unnamed international terror group\" for the attack, but said it was too early in the investigation to specify which one. H.G. Ragavendhra, Jaipur's superintendent of police, told CNN that police found nine newly-purchased bicycles at the scene, and think they were used to carry the explosives. The owner of the bike shop is helping police draw a sketch of the person who purchased them. Police have also picked up six suspects and were questioning them. Jaipur, known as the \"pink city\" for its rose-colored forts and palaces, is a popular tourist attraction. The majority Hindu city of 2.7 million people has a sizable Muslim population. The day-long curfew, authorities said, was meant to prevent \"communal violence.\" It was intended to prevent large crowds from gathering at the blast site and hampering the investigation, said Jaipur police director Kanhaiya Lal. Also, tempers could flare as mourners spend the day carrying bodies to their home villages and to crematoriums, he said. Home ministry officials suspect the Islamic militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami (HuJi) of being behind the attacks, according to CNN's sister network CNN-IBN and the Press Trust of India. No one has claimed responsibility. In the past, officials have blamed attacks within its borders on \"foreign\" Islamic extremist groups fighting against Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir. It is a term that is commonly understood to refer to Pakistan. Kashmir has been the source of bitter dispute and two wars between India and Pakistan. Both control parts of the region, which is predominantly Muslim. Pakistan has denied any involvement in the attacks.  See the aftermath of the explosions. \u00bb . Raje told reporters Wednesday that the military had been placed on alert and security tightened around the borders of the state, the western edge of which lies next to Pakistan. She also took to task the central government, saying it had provided no advance warning about the possibility of such an attack. Furthermore, Raje said, the central government left a state-proposed organized crime bill unapproved for two years. The bill would have allowed local police more leeway to interrogate suspects plotting attacks, she said. On Tuesday evening, eight bombs tore through crowded markets and a packed Hindu temple in Jaipur's walled city. The blasts went off within a 12-minute span and within 500 meters (0.3 miles) of each other. Police defused a ninth bomb. The Jaipur blasts bear an eerie resemblance in its pattern to a deadly attack two years ago in India's financial capital, Mumbai. In July 2006, more than 200 people were killed when seven explosions targeted commuter trains in Mumbai, formerly Bombay. In that incident, the explosions went off within a span of 11 minutes. Both attacks used RDX, one of the most powerful kinds of military explosives, and ammonium nitrate, an oxidizing agent in explosives. And both attacks took place during the evening hours and on Tuesdays. The Jaipur blasts occurred near the temple on a day when devotees pray to Hanuman, the Hindu monkey king. Nearby markets and bazaars that were also targeted were filled with tourists and locals. In the Mumbai attack, the blasts were timed to go off during the height of rush hour. And authorities said the bombs all appeared to have been planted on trains that left the Churchgate station -- used daily by thousands of commuters in the metropolis of more than 11 million people. Indian officials blamed Pakistan's intelligence services and a Pakistan-based militant group, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, for the attack. Pakistan, which banned Lashkar-e-Tayyiba in 2002, denied any involvement. The Jaipur blast has one more element in common with yet another deadly attack: the use of bicycles. Just as on Tuesday, assailants used bombs strapped to bicycles in an attack at a mosque in the western Indian city of Malegaon in September 2006. At least 33 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in that explosion, which took place on a Friday -- when the mosque is filled with Muslim worshippers. That attack was also blamed Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. Authorities have not connected the Jaipur blast to any previous attacks. HuJi -- or the Movement of Islamic Holy War -- is considered a terrorist organization by the United States. It is banned in neighboring Bangladesh, where it is accused of carrying out several attacks, including a foiled plot to kill the country's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2000. And it has been blamed for several attacks inside India, including one at the American Center in Calcutta that killed five policemen in 2002. India ranks among the countries where terrorism is most common, the U.S. State Department said. \"The conflict in Jammu and Kashmir, attacks by extreme leftist Naxalites and Maoists in eastern and central India, assaults by ethno-linguistic nationalists in the northeastern states, and terrorist strikes nationwide by Islamic extremists took more than 2,300 lives this year,\" the agency said.

An injured man rests at Swai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipur. Bicycles and rickshaws were strewn about the streets, with pools of blood nearby, in the northwestern city of Jaipur. Motorcycles, pieces of which were found at nearly every bomb site, appear to have been used in the attacks, said Rajasthan Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Indian government officials -- including Minister of State for Home Affairs Shriprakash Jaiswal -- were quick to label it a terrorist attack. The eight explosions started at about 7:30 p.m. (1400 GMT) and detonated within 12 minutes of each other, police said. The bombs exploded within about 500 meters (0.3 mile) of each other in Jaipur's old city, which is frequented by tourists.  See the aftermath of the explosions. \u00bb . An ninth bomb was defused, according to H.G. Raghavendra, a Jaipur city official. He described all the bombs as \"medium intensity.\" \"There is no reason to panic,\" he told CNN-IBN. \"Everything is under control.\" One blast struck near Hanuman Temple, which was crowded with Hindus worshipping Hanuman, the religion's monkey god. Another struck near a market area inside Jaipur's walled city where tourists and locals frequent restaurants and shops. Jaipur, known as the \"pink city,\" is about 260 kilometers (160 miles) southwest of India's capital, New Delhi. Many of the casualties were taken to SMS Hospital, the largest government hospital in Jaipur. People gathered outside the hospital to hear news about friends and relatives; the hospital issued an urgent appeal for blood donations. The state of Rajasthan, where Jaipur is located, was placed on alert, local officials said. Delhi police officials said they too were on high alert after the blasts and were receiving regular updates from Jaipur on developments in the investigation. The Deputy Chief Minister for the state of Maharashtra, R.R. Patil, said the entire state was also on high alert. Mumbai is in the state of Maharashtra. The attack was immediately condemned by the United States. U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the attacks were \"quite clearly an act intended to take innocent lives.\" He told reporters at his daily briefing that Washington was still collecting information, and could not \"offer insight into who may be responsible.\" According to the U.S. State Department, India ranks among the countries where terrorism is most common. \"The conflict in Jammu and Kashmir, attacks by extreme leftist Naxalites and Maoists in eastern and central India, assaults by ethno-linguistic nationalists in the northeastern states, and terrorist strikes nationwide by Islamic extremists took more than 2,300 lives this year,\" the agency said.

Meet \"Bum-bot,\" as Terrill describes it; others in his neighborhood call it simply, \"Robocop.\" This former BBQ smoker is armed with a water gun to chase off bums and drug dealers in downtown Atlanta. It's a barbecue smoker mounted on a three-wheeled scooter, and armed with an infrared camera, spotlight, loudspeaker and aluminum water cannon that shoots a stream of icy water about 20 feet. Operated by remote control, the robot spotlights trespassers on property down the street from his bar, O'Terrill's. Using a walkie-talkie, Terrill belts out through the robot's loudspeaker, \"That's private property. You guys need to get out of here.\" Terrill is chasing out unsavory-looking characters from a street corner that resembles a drug dealer's dream at night. More than 20 suspicious people were seen huddling in the dark in the front driveway and side parking lot on this night. Some were seen openly making drug deals.  Watch \"Bum-bot\" in action \u00bb . But during the day, it's where young children frolic on a nearby playground at a the Beacon of Light Daycare Center in downtown Atlanta. It has become a nightmare for day care operator Lydia Meredith. \"This whole square is enveloped with homeless people and drug dealers, defecating, urinating, prostituting -- the whole nine yards. And the overflow of that behavior, we get to cleanup every morning,\" she says. Meredith says people often toss used syringes and condoms onto the playground. Terrill, an engineer by trade, is also a board member at the day care center. Tired of cleaning up after the shady characters, he decided to take action. That's when he built his downtown Darth Vader of sorts. \"He's a neighborhood vigilante,\" says Meredith, \"and when he came up with this -- you know, I call it Robocop -- I said, 'Praise God.' \" The daycare center is a block from a homeless shelter. Meredith has a security guard at the center who leaves in the early evening. \"They know when the guard leaves,\" she says. \"They know when the cleaning crew leaves and then here comes the drug dealers to prey on the homeless people.\" Anita Beatty, the director of the shelter, is suspicious of the barbecue-smoker robot. \"I just think the whole 'Robocop' spraying people is a little freaky. We really need some police protection in this neighborhood. I think it's confusing the issue. I think the issue is homeless people. They are being confused with the folks who prey on them and sell them drugs,\" she says. Atlanta police patrol the area, but say it's difficult to stay on top of the large number of people who roam the streets in the area late at night. Police Major Lane Hagin says the robot is definitely a different crime-fighting idea. \"There's no problem with the robot going up and down the street or being visible or any of the other things it does -- with the exception of spraying water on people.\" Hagin adds, \"Then, it becomes an assault no matter where it happens.\" So far no one has filed charges against Terrill or the robot. But one homeless man who declined to give his name followed Terrill and his robot down the street and laughingly told him, \"I know about you. I can sue you for assault.\" Terrill says he's not hurting anyone and often sprays the water to the side of loiterers as a ploy to get them to move on. He's also not about to back down. \"If you're throwing condoms out on the side of the playground, if you're throwing needles, you're throwing crack pipes out there, I'm not going to let those kids be out there like that. I'm going to stop you.\" Terrill bought his bar four years ago knowing nothing about the restaurant business. He ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor of Georgia in 2006. He's had ongoing problems with people breaking into his bar and stealing things, but it was the day care center problems that spurred him on to create the robot. Some of Terrill's bar patrons say they've seen a difference in the neighborhood. Susanne Coe lives nearby. \"I've seen a marked change simply with this robot that doesn't have any power of arrest. It does scare people and to be honest with you I'm grateful for it,\" she says. On this night, as Terrill and his robot make their way to the street corner, he shines the robot's spotlight on the parking lot of the daycare center. One by one, the shadowy figures stand up, walk away and saunter down the street. \"Ninety-nine percent of the time, when I go up there and once I turn the spotlight on and I talk to them through the speaker, they leave,\" he says.

New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer arrives with his wife Monday for a press conference. Now, after federal investigators have linked the New York governor to a top-dollar prostitution ring, political advisers are split over whether Spitzer has any political future at all. \"There's no way he can survive it,\" said Ed Rollins, a Republican political consultant and adviser to former presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. \"All the facts aren't out there, but as they're being reported, there's no way you can survive. \"Not only is he a hypocrite, he may also end up being a charged felon.\" On Monday, Spitzer publicly apologized for an undisclosed personal matter. He did not specifically mention the prostitution sting, nor did he resign.  Watch Spitzer's apology \u00bb . The apology came four days after federal prosecutors announced the arrests of four people in an international prostitution ring that charged clients up to $5,500 an hour. A source with knowledge of the probe said that wiretaps in the case identify Spitzer as an unnamed client who met a prostitute on February 13 at a Washington hotel. Many political professionals said they were stunned by Monday's developments regarding Spitzer, a man who once made a name for himself going after organized crime and Wall Street corruption as New York's attorney general. \"Obviously, the facts are going to come out in the next several days and the story will be told,\" said Robert Zimmerman, a political adviser and Democratic National Committee member. \"But if the facts are as we suspect, it's very hard to imagine him staying in office.\" But James Carville, a CNN political analyst and onetime adviser to former President Bill Clinton, said Spitzer could hold on to his position if the scandal remains strictly about sex -- or if it's revealed that his political enemies were responsible for leaking the story. Carville mentioned other high-profile politicians who have weathered sex scandals, including Republican Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor after his arrest in a men's room sex sting, and his own former client, President Clinton. \"All of us remember the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the immediate rush to judgment,\" he said. \"A lot of people said, 'How could Bill Clinton survive a scandal like that?'

McGreevey, who announced he is gay and is now attending an Episcopalian seminary, and Matos are in the midst of divorce proceedings. Matos said \"was very difficult for the family\" when her husband tried to hang on to the governor's office for several months after stories about the relationship with the aide surfaced. \"I thought Gov. Spitzer was going to announce his resignation today,\" Matos told CNN's \"Larry King Live.\" \"By not doing so, he's only prolonging the pain and and anguish and humiliation for his wife and family.\"  Watch responses to the question: Will Spitzer have to resign? \u00bb .

Gordon B. Hinckley, 97, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, died Sunday. Hinckley had \"been in failing health for some time and his passing is due to age,\" said church spokesman Bruce Olsen. \"He was speaking in public as late as two to three weeks ago and had a full schedule in his office as late as last week.\" Hinckley became president of the Salt Lake City-based church in 1995, at age 84, and had been a member of its top leadership since the 1960s. Mormon church presidents serve for life. The church has about 13 million members worldwide and has experienced 5 percent annual growth in recent years. He died about 7 p.m. Sunday with his family by his side, church officials said. \"His life was a true testament of service, and he had an abiding love for others,\" said U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican and fellow Mormon. \"His wit, wisdom, and exemplary leadership will be missed by not only members of our faith, but by people of all faiths throughout the world.\" Hinckley married Marjorie Pay at the Salt Lake City temple in 1937. They had five children, 25 grandchildren and 38 great-grandchildren. Marjorie Hinckley died in 2004. \"I've been blessed so abundantly that I can never get over it,\" Hinckley told CNN's Larry King in 2004. \"I just feel so richly blessed. I want to extend that to others, whenever I can.\" Hinckley was the 15th president in the 177-year history of the Mormon church. President Bush awarded him a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004.  Watch Hinckley receive medal, share his views \u00bb . According to a church statement, Hinckley was the most-traveled president in the church's history, visiting more than 60 countries. He also oversaw a massive temple-building program, doubling the number of temples worldwide to more than 100. Hinckley spent 70 years working in the church and is considered the architect of its vast public relations network. He worked to defuse controversies over polygamy and to promote full inclusion of nonwhites. Mormons believe the president of the church is a living prophet and apostle. They considered his words divinely inspired, including his views on homosexuality and the role of men and women in the home. \"We are not anti-gay. We are pro-family, let me put it that way,\" Hinckley told King in 2004. \"We love these people and try to work with them and help them. We know they have a problem. We want to help them solve that problem.\" In an earlier interview with King, Hinckley laid out his views on family structure. \"Put father at the head of the house again,\" he said. \"A good father, who loves his wife and whose wife loves him, and whose children love him ... and let them grow together as good citizens of the land.\" A church body known as the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles becomes its governing body upon the death of a president.

John McCain, whose White House aspirations went into a nose dive last summer, clinched the Republican Party's presidential nomination Tuesday night with a sweep of GOP contests in four states. \"I am very, very grateful and pleased to note that tonight, my friends, we have won enough delegates to claim with confidence, humility and a great sense of responsibility, that I will be the Republican nominee for president of the United States,\" McCain told supporters in Texas. CNN estimates that McCain has amassed 1,195 delegates to the GOP's September convention in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, four more than the 1,191 needed to claim the party's nomination. \"Now, we begin the most important part of our campaign: to make a respectful, determined and convincing case to the American people that our campaign and my election as president, given the alternative presented by our friends in the other party, is in the best interest in the country that we love,\" McCain said. \"The big battle's to come,\" he said. \"I do not underestimate the significance nor the size of the challenge.\"  Watch McCain address supporters after sweeping Tuesday's contests \u00bb .

Watch as Huckabee ends his presidential bid \u00bb .

Allocate delegates yourself and see how the numbers add up \u00bb . \"Tomorrow, he can get started,\" Castellanos said. \"He'll have the [Republican National Committee] behind him. He'll have a broad base of financial support. It's a big step. Meanwhile, it looks like the Democrats are engaged in the land war across Russia, so he's got a big advantage now.\" Both Clinton, the New York senator and former first lady, and Obama, the first-term senator from Illinois, called McCain on Tuesday night, campaign officials said. Obama told McCain he looks forward to running against him in the fall, campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said. McCain is slated to go to the White House on Wednesday to receive the endorsement of President Bush, according to two Republican sources. The Arizona senator's campaign -- his second run for the White House -- was largely written off last summer amid outspoken opposition from the party's conservative base, a major staff shakeup and disappointing fundraising. But the former Navy pilot and Vietnam prisoner of war rebounded with wins in January's primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina, the state where his first presidential bid foundered. \"There were times, obviously, when my political campaign was not viewed as the most viable in America, as you probably know,\" he told reporters in San Antonio earlier Tuesday. \"In fact, I was reminded of the words of Chairman Mao, who said it's always darkest before it's totally black.\" McCain's fortunes also rebounded as U.S. commanders in Iraq credited the 2007 launch of a campaign to pacify Baghdad and its surrounding provinces with a sharp decline in American and Iraqi casualties. The senator had been one of the most outspoken advocates of the shift and has blasted his potential Democratic rivals for calling for the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from the widely unpopular war. \"This is a man with a lot of trials in his life,\" said former Education Secretary William Bennett, a CNN contributor. \"He's had a lot of downs; he's been up, and this is a big up.\" McCain has been turning his fire on the Democrats, for whom Tuesday's races in Ohio and Texas are seen as pivotal.  See scenes from Tuesday's voting \u00bb . But Democrats have been pounding McCain over his January comment that he would be satisfied if U.S. troops remained in Iraq for 100 years, as long as the insurgency there died down. And Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean has attacked his reputation as a reformer over the past week, accusing McCain of trying to evade federal spending limits by opting out of public financing after using the promise of federal funds to obtain a bank loan and automatic ballot access for his primary campaign. Dean told CNN on Tuesday that McCain \"really is the focus of what we're doing now, in terms of his ethics problems and his problems with the war and his problems with the huge deficits that they've run up on the Republican side.\" In 2000, McCain upset then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the New Hampshire primary by touting \"straight talk\" and his record as a Republican maverick. Bush came back in South Carolina amid a divisive and bitter campaign that left McCain denouncing leaders of the party's religious conservative wing as \"agents of intolerance,\" and Bush went on to win the presidency. Since then, McCain has enraged conservative leaders by opposing Bush's signature tax cuts, co-sponsoring the campaign finance reform law that now bears his name and supporting a controversial White House-backed plan to offer a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. But their support was spread among a fractured GOP field, and their main standard-bearer, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, quit the race after a disappointing showing in February's Super Tuesday primaries. Exit polls in Texas and Ohio found that about three-quarters of Republicans would be satisfied with McCain as their nominee, however. Those surveys found that the economy was the top issue for GOP voters in both states -- and by a wide margin in Ohio, which has seen a sharp decline in manufacturing jobs in the past decade. Although national security issues are a strong suit for McCain, Castellanos said he might need some help if a weakening economy is the central issue in November. \"It's never been Sen. McCain's strength,\" Castellanos said. He said McCain would need to make the case that \"I'm going to grow this economy; Barack or Hillary, they're going to grow government.\" McCain had amassed 1,047 delegates before Tuesday, according to CNN estimates. At stake in Tuesday's contests were 256 delegates, allocated on a winner-take-all basis by statewide or congressional district results. E-mail to a friend .

Josef Fritzl admitted to authorities he raped his daughter and fathered her children. Investigators believe Fritzl planned to build the cellar as early as 1978, shortly after, according to his daughter, he began raping her at age 11 or 12, said police spokesman Franz Polzer. The 73-year-old Austrian began building the dungeon as part of an addition to his home that year, and simply added the hidden space -- which was not recorded in any building plans -- Polzer said. It took Fritzl until 1983 to finish the addition, Polzer said. Investigators recently discovered another door to the dungeon prison, which was blocked by a 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) steel and concrete door that Fritzl probably stopped using when he later constructed an electronic door for a second entrance, Polzer said. Fritzl, who police believe was the only one with access to the cellar, had to travel through an elaborate maze to get to the prison. \"You would have to open up a total of eight doors, and ... (for the) last door which would go into this space (where the family was imprisoned), you would also have to use electronic opening apparatus,\" Polzer said. \"We will have to find out perhaps later from now if perhaps there are other spaces we haven't discovered yet, and perhaps maybe there is something else interesting.\" Fritzl was recently arrested and confessed to holding his daughter, Elisabeth, captive in the dungeon under the Fritzl home for decades, repeatedly raping her and fathering seven children -- six of whom survived. Three of the children were adopted by Josef Fritzl and his wife after he concocted the ruse that Elisabeth had left the babies on their doorstep. The story of the family's imprisonment began to unravel more than two weeks ago, when one of the children still in the dungeon, 19-year-old Kerstin Fritzl, fell seriously ill with convulsions. The father agreed to take her to a hospital, the first time she was allowed out of the prison where she had spent her entire life with her mother and two brothers. Dr. Albert Reiter, who is treating Kerstin, said Monday that while her condition is still \"grave,\" it \"has improved somewhat.\" \"She has become more stable, but despite that we have to continue to keep her under sedation and give her respiratory help,\" Reiter said, noting it is not clear how long she will be kept under sedation. Elisabeth and her two sons were reunited with her mother, Rosemarie, who police say knew nothing about the basement prison. They were also reunited with the three children that Josef had taken from Elisabeth. The reunited family is living in secluded quarters at a psychiatric clinic, where they are finding a daily routine and adjusting to sunlight -- something the two boys had never seen -- according to the clinic's chief doctor. \"The mother and the smallest child have, in just the last couple of days, increased their sensitivity to light,\" Dr. Berthold Kepplinger said. \"So we have been able to equip them with protective sunglasses.\" Five-year-old Felix is \"getting more and more lively,\" Kepplinger said. \"He's fascinated by everything that he sees around him -- the fresh air, the light, and the food -- all of these things are helping them,\" he said. \"Slowly the color of their skin is changing back to a more normal (shade).\" He also said the family members are still getting to know each other and live together as a family. Kepplinger praised Elisabeth for having provided a daily living routine for her children during their captivity. He said the family is getting into a new routine in which the mother and the grandmother make breakfast for the family, and the children make their beds. However, he said there is a noticeable difference between the pace of life of the children held in captivity and that of those who grew up in Fritzl's home. He said the mother, Elisabeth, takes breaks and naps several times a day. The health of the family members is satisfactory and hospital staff have been able to let more and more light into the rooms where the family is staying, Kepplinger said. Kepplinger said the children, after being confined to a small space their entire lives, are finding it increasingly easy to be in larger spaces. Initially the dungeon where Fritzl held his daughter was only 35 square meters. In 1993, around the time Elisabeth was pregnant with her fourth child, Fritzl decided to add to the dungeon, building another room that increased the entire living space of the family to about 55 square meters. On Wednesday or Thursday, prosecution authorities will attempt to question Fritzl -- who is no longer talking to police following his initial confession, state prosecutor Gerhard Sedlacek said. A warden at the St. Poelten jail, where Fritzl is being held, told CNN that Fritzl appears to be doing well, but he is refusing to go on walks outside the building where he is detained.

Iraqi authorities say this man has confessed to killing 15 girls, including a 9-year-old. \"How many girls did you kill and rape?\" the soldier asks. \"I raped one, sir,\" the man responds. \"What was her name?\" \"Ahlam,\" he says. Ahlam was a university student in the predominantly Shiite city of Basra. The detainee said the gang he was in kidnapped her as she was leaving the university, heading home. \"They forced me, and I killed her with a machine gun, sir,\" he says. The suspect, who is unshaven and appears to be in his 20s or 30s, was arrested by Iraq security forces after they retook most of Basra in April. CNN was shown what authorities say was his first confession. On it are the names of 15 girls whom he admitted kidnapping, raping and killing. The youngest girl on the list was just 9 years old. Basra turned into a battleground between warring Shiite factions vying for control of the country's oil-rich south after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Basra's streets teemed with Shiite militias armed with weapons, mostly from Iran, according to the Iraqi forces and the U.S. military.  Watch a mom describe her three sons killed \u00bb . For four years after the invasion, Basra was under the control of British forces, but they were unable to contain the violence and withdrew in September last year. Women bore the brunt of the militias' extremist ideologies. The militants spray-painted threats on walls across Basra, warning women to wear headscarves and not to wear makeup. Women were sometimes executed for the vague charge of doing something \"un-Islamic.\" In the wasteland on the outskirts of Basra, dotted with rundown homes, the stench of death mixes with the sewage. Local residents told the Iraqi army that executions often take place in the area, particularly for women, sometimes killed for something as seemingly innocuous as wearing jeans. Militias implemented their own laws with abandon, threatening stores for displaying mannequins with bare shoulders or for selling Western music. Many store owners are still too frightened to speak publicly. But the horrors of militia rule are now surfacing as some residents begin to feel more comfortable speaking out. Inside her rundown home, Sabriya's watery eyes peer out from under her robe. She points to the first photo of one of her sons on the wall. \"This one was killed because he was drinking,\" she says. She draws her finger across her neck and gestures at the next photo. \"This one was slaughtered for his car.\" \"This one the same,\" she adds, looking at the third. Her three sons, her daughter and her sister were all killed by the hard-line militia. Her sister was slaughtered because she was a single woman living alone, Sabriya says. \"They came in at night and put a pillow on her face and shot her in the head,\" she says. Sabriya lives on what was once dubbed \"murder street\" for the daily killings that happened there last year. On the day CNN visited, dozens of young men sat where there used to be piles of bodies. Sheik Maktouf al-Maraiyani shudders at the memory. \"Every day, we would find 10 or 15 of our men killed,\" he says, adding sorrowfully \"one of them was my son.\" His son was 25 years old. Now, \"murder street\" is part of a citywide effort to get Basra back on its feet. In a project funded by U.S. forces, Sheikh Maktouf and others are being paid $20 a day and upwards to clean up trash.  Watch the transformation of 'murder street' \u00bb . Basra may be part of the country's oil-rich south, but it wallows in its own sewage and trash. The stench of filth is impossible to escape. The effort also helps with the massive unemployment plaguing the city. British forces officially handed over responsibility of Basra to Iraqi forces in December. \"The situation was so bad because the security forces were controlled by the militias,\" says Brig. Gen. Aziz al-Swady, who commands the 14th Iraq Army Divison. To help curb the violence, British troops have returned to the city, adopting the U.S. approach of embedding with Iraqi units as advisers. The Iraqi prime minister also has flooded the city with additional troops, bringing in soldiers from western Iraq along with their American advisers. \"Now the citizens have started to trust the Iraqi security forces,\" said al-Swady. The biggest difference is that residents are starting to leave their homes, something unthinkable just a few months ago. At one of the parks in the city this past weekend, a father named Al'aa was out with his three young children and his wife. \"It's the first time that we have dared to come here in two years,\" he said. The park was once often used for executions. Everyone, residents and soldiers alike, knows the battle for Basra is not over.

The figures are estimates, a campaign spokesman said. \"We're still calculating.\" Sources in Sen. Hillary Clinton's campaign said the New York senator raised $20 million in March. Impressive as the $40 million figure is, it is well below the $55 million Obama raised in February. Clinton, Obama's rival for the Democratic nomination, raised about $35 million in February. Political analysts say this kind of fundraising power catches the attention of voters. \"They add to the so-called 'bandwagon effect' -- the sense that Obama is building, that he's going to be the nominee,\" said Stu Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report.

Clinton raised $156 million through the end of February. The Clinton campaign said Thursday morning it would not release March figures until required to file its FEC report, two days before the critical Pennsylvania primary April 22. But later, campaign sources provided the figures, which show March to be Clinton's second-highest fund-raising month for the campaign. A Clinton spokesman downplayed the importance of Obama's fundraising total. \"We knew that he was going to out-raise us. He has out-raised us for the last several months,\" Howard Wolfson said after Obama's figures were released. \"We will have the resources that we need to compete and be successful in the upcoming primary states.\" Wolfson also said he expected Clinton's tax returns to be released soon. Clinton pledged March 25 she would release her returns within a week. Sen. John McCain, the expected Republican nominee, raised $11 million in February. He has not announced his March total.

These \"Scotists,\" \"Dunsmen,\" or \"Dunses\" were considered hairsplitting meatheads and, eventually, just \"dunces.\" 2.(slipping a) Mickey . When you have to drug somebody against their will (hey, you gotta do what you gotta do), it just wouldn't sound right to slip 'em a Ricardo, a Bjorn, or an Evelyn. It's gotta be a Mickey. At the turn of the 20th century, Mickey Finn was a Chicago saloon owner in one of the seediest parts of town -- and he fit right in. Finn was known for serving \"Mickey Finn Specials,\" which probably included chloral hydrate, a heavy sedative. After targeted customers passed out, Finn would haul them into his \"operating room\" and liberate them of all valuables (including shoes). Never a Host of the Year candidate, this Mickey seems to have thoroughly earned his legacy, so don't hesitate to use it the next time you drug and rob your own customers. 3. Spoonerism . Reverend William Archibald Spooner (1844--1930) was famous for his muddled one-liners. And though it's hard to know which ones he actually said, lines such as \"I have a half-warmed fish\" and \"Yes indeed, the Lord is a shoving leopard\" still prove that the sound-switching flub is pretty charming as far as mistakes go. The spoonerism has even been used as a literary technique by poets and fiction writers, giving Spooner little reason to roll over -- or otherwise inarticulately protest -- in his grave. 4. Lynch . Although several Lynches (not including David) have been investigated by inquisitive etymologists, Virginia native Charles Lynch (1736--1796) is most likely the man behind the murderous word. Lynch was a patriot, a planter, and a judge. But when he headed a vigilante court to punish Tories (British loyalists) during the American Revolution, he decided to play the roles of jury and executioner, too. Lynch has more than earned his besmirched name. In fact, he did half the besmirching himself by egotistically referring to his actions as \"lynch law\" and \"lynching.\" 5. Shrapnel . While battling Napoleon's army, English General Henry Shrapnel (1761--1842) noticed that original-flavor cannonballs just weren't massacring enough enemies for his liking. So, to get more shebang for his shilling, he filled the cannonballs with bullets and exploding charges. These \"shrapnel shells,\" or \"shrapnel-barrages,\" were pretty darn effective, and later designs proved even more successful in World War I. Shrapnel didn't get much credit for the \"innovation\" during his lifetime, but he ultimately contributed to enough death and misery that he pretty much deserves to be synonymous with a violent, metallic byproduct of combat. 6. Draconian . A Lexis-Nexis news search shows that folks are still talking about \"draconian policies,\" \"draconian penalties,\" and, most frighteningly, \"draconian sex rules.\" Though Athenian lawgiver Draco is not entirely confirmed to have existed, if he were real, then around 621 B.C.E., he instituted two time-honored traditions: 1) writing laws down and 2) making laws that were batcrap-insane . They include ascribing the death penalty to such atrocities as being lazy, whizzing in an alley, and stealing an apple. Apparently, he justified his measures with a sort of non-logic along the lines of, \"Jaywalkers deserve to die, and I can't do anything worse to mass murderers. So what're you gonna do?\" 7. Boycott . In a nutshell? Boycott got boycotted. Charles Cunningham Boycott (1832--1897) was a retired English army captain who claimed his unwanted fame in 1880 when the Irish Land League decided to punish him for not lowering his rents. This then-new strategy, which was a mere paragraph in the Russian-novel-size saga of Irish land reform, was a kind of systematic shunning in which Boycott was cut off from servants, supplies, mail, and lifestyle free of death threats. He might have been an evil landlord, but if Boycott could see just how successful his name became, he'd probably be a very sad, regretful, evil landlord. 8. Tawdry . The story of St. Audrey (also known as St. Etheldreda) is a classic example of how bad names happen to good people. St. Audrey was the daughter of the king of East Anglia (then the Norfolk section of Anglo-Saxon England), who lived a monastery-founding, self-abdicating life. But, when she died of the plague in 679, she was sporting a pretty nasty-looking tumor on her neck, which gossipmongers blamed on her penchant for wearing audacious necklaces in her youth. After her death, silk scarves called \"St. Audrey laces\" were sold in her honor at Ely's annual St. Audrey's Fair. Then the British tendency for dropping letters and syllables took over, and Audrey became \"tawdry.\" It was a short trip from there to the dictionary, and tawdry has been synonymous with gaudy ever since. 9. Chauvinism . Nicolas Chauvin was an early 19th--century French soldier who was so patriotic and nationalistic, he gave patriotism and nationalism a bad name -- or at least a new name. A slave to the cult of Napoleon, Chauvin shed his fair share of blood for the emperor. How did Napoleon show his appreciation? By giving Chauvin a ceremonial saber, a ribbon, and a pittance of a pension. Later, however, French dramatists began basing \u00fcber-patriotic characters on Chauvin, which paved the way for the soldier's ultimate reward: a dubious spot in the English language.

Barack Obama for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, saying the senator from Illinois is a \"candidate to bring change to our country.\" \"Barack Obama isn't just going to break the mold,\" said Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate four years ago. \"Together, we are going to shatter it into a million pieces.\" The senator from Massachusetts made the announcement in front of an enthusiastic crowd in Charleston, South Carolina, 16 days ahead of the state's Democratic primary. Kerry said he was stirred by the way Obama \"eloquently reminded us of the fact that our true genius is faith in simple dreams and insistence on small miracles.\"  Watch Kerry explain why he's picking Obama \u00bb . The endorsement could be seen as a blow to former Sen. John Edwards, who was Kerry's running mate in the 2004 election. Edwards also is vying for the Democratic presidential nomination this year. The endorsement shouldn't come as a surprise to Edwards, who was publicly critical of Kerry's campaign after the earlier election. Following news of the endorsement, Edwards released a statement saying he respects Kerry's decision. \"When we were running against each other and on the same ticket, John and I agreed on many issues,\" Edwards said. \"I continue to believe that this election is about the future, not the past, and that the country needs a president who will fight aggressively to end the status quo and change the Washington system and to give voice to all of those whose voices are ignored in the corridors of power.\" Kerry made an oblique reference to the other candidates in the race \"with whom I have worked and who I respect\" in his speech Thursday. \"They are terrific public servants, and each of them could be president tomorrow, and each would fight to take this country in the right direction, but I believe that more than anyone else, Barack Obama can help our country turn the page and get America moving by uniting and ending the division that we have faced,\" he said. A source suggested senator's support for Obama will be a big boost because Kerry \"remains one of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party and [has] an e-mail list with millions of addresses.\" In an e-mail sent to the JohnKerry.com community Thursday, the former presidential candidate said the next president of the United States \"can be, should be, and will be Barack Obama.\" A Kerry spokesman said Obama will be sending out a note to Kerry's e-mail list, which was created during the 2004 run and numbers 3 million. Obama on Wednesday picked up endorsements from two key unions in Nevada, which holds its caucuses January 19. Atlanta, Georgia, Mayor Shirley Franklin recently announced her endorsement of Obama, and sources said Thursday that Sen. Tim Johnson of South Dakota also would back the senator from Illinois.

The rising prices are \"threatening to plunge more than 100 million people on every continent into hunger,\" Josette Sheeran, executive director of the United Nations' World Food Program, said on the agency's Web site Tuesday. Sheeran is one of the experts attending a Food summit hosted Tuesday by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, aimed at determining ways to boost food supplies and identify deterrents. Also attending the meeting are scientists and representatives from the European Union and Africa. On the Web site, Sheeran said the increase in food prices is \"a silent tsunami that respects no borders.\" \"The world's misery index is rising ... as soaring food and fuel prices roll through the lives of the most vulnerable,\" she said Friday. The crisis is forcing the organization to look for cuts in aid to some of its recipients, she said. Soaring food prices have triggered violence in some developing countries, and biofuels are bearing at least part of the blame. Producing fuel from plant crops is supposed to be greener than drilling for oil, and biofuels generally burn cleaner, too. But the global biofuels industry now stands accused of a list of side effects that are said to be damaging lives, especially of the world's poorest people. \"The drive for more biofuels means more investment is going into those crops, meaning less land and less investment going in for food crops, causing a massive conflict and resulting in rising prices, which is having a huge negative impact, especially on developing countries,\" said Clare Oxborrow, food campaigner for Friends of the Earth.  See why tortilla makers are blaming biofuel for increasing food prices \u00bb . Critics also say that in Africa, Asia and South America, people are being driven from their land and forests are being cleared to make room for the booming biofuel industry. The International Food Policy Research Institute says the use of cereals for industrial purposes like making biofuels has risen by a quarter since 2000. Brown said in an article posted on the 10 Downing Street Web site, \"We now know that biofuels intended to promote energy independence and combat climate change are frequently energy-inefficient. \"We need to look closely at the impact on food prices and the environment of different production methods and to ensure we are more selective in our support. If our UK review shows that we need to change our approach, we will also push for change in EU biofuels targets,\" he said. \"We must also do more to explore the links between climate change and food, and particularly their impact on the livelihoods and vulnerability of the very poorest, who are likely to be most affected by climate change.\" The meeting he convened, Brown said, is a precursor to the G8 summit of industrial nations, to be held in July, and a special U.N. summit in September. He urged prompt action. \"With one child dying every five seconds from hunger-related causes, the time to act is now,\" Brown stressed. The World Health Organization views hunger as the No. 1 threat to public health around the world, responsible for a third of child deaths and 10 percent of all disease. Douglas Alexander, Britain's International Development secretary, announced Tuesday that Britain has set aside a 455 million-pound [$900 million] aid package to address the food crisis.

A gallon of gas cost an average of $3.62, according to AAA, and much more in some markets. Shell Oil Co. President John Hofmeister says a boost in U.S. production would startle the world market. All three presidential candidates have weighed in on the issue, and President Bush on Tuesday addressed it during a news conference. John Hofmeister, president of Shell Oil Co., the U.S. division of Royal Dutch Shell, addressed rising gasoline prices during an interview Wednesday with John Roberts on CNN's \"American Morning.\" ROBERTS: What do you say to people who are in this budget crunch of trying to fill up the family car? HOFMEISTER: I say we need more gas to be produced in this country. I've been saying that for three years, ever since I took this position [as president of Shell]. If the U.S. set a goal to produce 2 to 3 million barrels more a day in this country, we would send a shock around the world that would immediately say to the speculators, hey, U.S. is serious. President [Bush] said something yesterday about this. I didn't hear him, but I think that's good news. But we should set a specific target. The presidential candidates should be out there on the postings saying let's increase domestic production by 2 to 3 million barrels a day. That would be something that would put money back into this country, jobs back into this country, and it would bring more supply toward the Americans who need it. ROBERTS: The president is advocating more drilling on U.S. territory. Isn't it true that globally we're starting to reach a peak in production and that within maybe a decade or two oil production will begin to decrease? HOFMEISTER: Well, I think there is some argument [that] with convenient, easy oil we will peak sometime in the next decade. I think Shell sees that coming, but in terms of total oil supply to the world, we're a long way from reaching peak oil because it doesn't take into account unconventional oil. I think the president brings up a good point in that we could, we have the available domestic supplies off the coast of Alaska as well as [the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge]. Shell has won $2 billion worth of high bids for the Chukchi Sea -- that's a few years off before we could begin production. But let's remember there's more than 100 billion barrels of untouched oil and gas in this country that is subject to a 30-year moratorium. Now, there's only one body in this country that can set a 30-year moratorium, and that's the U.S. government. ROBERTS: Sen. Hillary Clinton wants to slap you with a 50 percent tax on what she calls windfall profit, profit above a certain level. Is that a good idea? HOFMEISTER: Look at our revenues and our income for the last quarter. If we had made $7.8 million on $114 million of revenue, nobody would call that excessive, because that's 7\u00bd percent. We made $7.8 billion profit on $114 billion revenue -- same 7\u00bd percent. So to me that is not an excessive number when banks and pharmaceuticals and IT companies earn a whole lot more.  Watch Hofmeister defend Shell's profits \u00bb . ROBERTS: Would it hurt you if she put in place this tax on the windfall profits? HOFMEISTER: Sure it would. It would slow down investment. Taxing the oil companies was tried in the '80s. It drove us to do imports, which is exactly the problem we have today. ROBERTS: Where is the top of all this? How high can the price of a barrel of oil go? How high will the cost of a gallon of gasoline go? HOFMEISTER: I heard somebody say the other day it's as long as a piece of string. We don't know. ROBERTS: The president of OPEC said $200 a barrel. HOFMEISTER: Yeah, well, there are some countries out there subsidizing the cost of their energy to their consumers and industries to compete with America -- or against America -- because they think America won't solve the problem. ROBERTS: You're saying you have no idea where the top is. HOFMEISTER: We don't know. But we should produce more oil in this country.

Destruction in Atlanta's historic Cabbagetown district, which many artists call home. Saturday morning, people were out walking their dogs, sipping coffee and taking a look at who was hit the worst in Atlanta's Cabbagetown district. It appeared Friday night's 130 mph tornado had delivered its wrath randomly -- some houses were perfectly intact while others were flooded and smashed. \"It's a sad thing,\" said 56-year-old Bertha Wise, standing next to a splintered tree that had buried her car and blocked a side-door to her yellow and cobalt-blue house. A sign advertising her hand-crafted art, which she sells from her home, hung slightly askew. \"I was cooking dinner and the lights started to flicker,\" she said. \"There was no warning. My door flung open and papers went flying. By that time, there was nowhere to go.\" Without a basement, she hunkered down and hoped for the best. But Wise fared well compared with her neighbors in this historic neighborhood, which has gone from crime-ridden to cool in recent years. A few blocks down, a woman named Rebecca -- too distraught to speak with a reporter -- carried what belongings she had left out of her rental home, which had been split in half by a giant oak tree.  Watch residents describe the storm's quick arrival \u00bb . She wasn't at home at the time, her landlord Mark Rogers told CNN, which was a good thing for her safety. But in the early morning hours, looters got there before she had and took almost everything. Looting was a problem throughout the neighborhood, many said.  See photos of the damage \u00bb . A few doors down from her, Pastor Richard Davis stared up at the tire-size hole in the roof of his Eastside Christian Community Pentecostal Church. He has been preaching in its single room for 10 years. \"Yes...well, that is something isn't it?\" he said, then gestured to the church's bathroom -- a brick yellow outhouse. \"That's still here though. We'll be OK.\" He plans to give a sermon on Palm Sunday and ask his parishioners to pray hard that lack of insurance won't force him to close his doors. Steven and Laura Powell, thinking they were in store for a short lightning storm, were startled by the storm's quick escalation. They were frightened when they spotted the storm beginning to circulate in the distance from their tiny home, and rushed to scoop up their sleeping 5-week-old Audrey. Bundled in a soft pink onesie, Audrey was still sleeping Saturday morning as her parents walked the neighborhood, amazed that their home had not been damaged -- and that their daughter had snoozed through the entire ordeal. \"I just put myself on top of [Laura] and the baby and we got under the strongest beam in the house,\" said Steven Powell. \"I thought that if a tree came crashing through, I'd take the brunt of it.\" Cabbagetown's houses were built for the workers at the local Fulton Cotton Mill. The mill closed and the neighborhood slid into decay. The renaissance of Cabbagetown began when the mill buildings were converted to the trendy Fulton Cotton Mill Lofts and the artists and urban pioneers moved in. In addition to hitting the houses, Friday night's tornado seriously damaged the top floor of the lofts. Remarkably, nobody was hurt. Cabbagetown residents remember when the under-construction lofts survived a five-alarm fire in 1999 -- and say they plan to rebuild and survive this disaster as well.

Bryant Purvis was arrested after a fight Wednesday at his Texas high school, police said. Bryant Purvis, 19, was arrested after the incident at Hebron High School in Carrollton, Texas. Carrollton police Sgt. John Singleton told CNN the altercation does not appear to be racially motivated. School officials contacted police about the fight Wednesday morning. An 18-year-old student told authorities two males approached him and asked if he had flattened the tires of \"their homeboy's\" car, according to an affidavit supporting the arrest warrant. The student said he didn't, but the two told him they didn't believe him and walked away. Purvis, he said, approached him from behind immediately afterward, then grabbed him with one hand and began to choke him. \"Purvis continued to choke [the student] and told him, 'Don't you ever mess with my car again,'\" the affidavit said. \"Purvis then pushed his head into the seating area of the bench,\" causing the student to strike his left eye, then walked away. The affidavit said that in a written statement, Purvis wrote, \"I walked over to him and grabbed him by his neck, then told him not to mess with my car anymore, then I left.\" Police reported the student had marks on his neck and bruising on his eye. A municipal judge set Purvis' bond at $1,000, and he was transferred to the Denton County Detention Facility, Singleton said. Purvis is one of six former students in Jena, Louisiana, accused of being involved in the beating of a white student. He initially was charged with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy, but charges against him were reduced in November to second-degree aggravated battery. He is awaiting trial in that case. Civil rights leaders Martin Luther King III and Al Sharpton led more than 15,000 marchers to Jena -- a town of about 3,000 -- in September to protest how authorities handled the cases against Purvis and the five others accused in the December 2006 beating of fellow student Justin Barker. After his arraignment in November, Purvis told reporters he had moved to another town to complete high school.

Military policemen patrol the creeks of the Omadino community in Warri South district of the Niger Delta. In a letter written by a group called Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND, the group said they attacked two pipelines they believed are owned by Chevron Corp. and Shell oil. A spokesman for Royal Dutch Shell said its pipeline was damaged last week. The attack will temporarily cut shipments by 169,000 barrels a day as workers try to repair the damage, the spokesman said. The pipeline is owned jointly by Shell and Nigerian, French and Italian oil companies, the spokesman said. Chevron spokesman Kurt Glaubitz told CNN that \"No Chevron pipelines have been vandalized in Nigeria.\" There was no immediate comment from the Nigerian government.

The letter stated that two other letters had been sent to Bush and also actor George Clooney, and the group also asked for President Jimmy Carter to help. Clooney is one of the United Nations'  Messengers of Peace, and has campaigned for an end to the long-standing conflict in Darfur, as well as further humanitarian relief efforts in the region.  Carter is currently in the Middle East, where he has met with the exiled militant Hamas leader Khalid Meshaal, on what he calls a \"study mission\" to support peace, democracy, and human rights in the region. \"MEND is prepared for talks and will prefer Ex President Jimmy Carter to mediate. Mr. Carter is not in denial as the rest of you who brand freedom fighters as terrorists,\" the letter stated. \"The ripple effect of this attack will touch your economy and people one way or the other and hope we now have your attention.\" The organization also said they attack was in response to one of the arrest of one of their members, Henry Okah, who was arrested last year and according to local reports, is charged with treason. Since late 2005, MEND militants have carried out numerous attacks on Nigeria's oil sector and abducted dozens of foreign workers, releasing nearly all of them unharmed. In the past the organization has said it had ratcheted up its attacks to redress what it says is the unequal distribution of the nation's oil wealth.

Mr. and Mrs. Chng Kee started out producing soya and oyster sauces, bean paste and plum paste in the 1970s. It was founded by the late Mr. Chng Kee, a former soya salesman, who ran the business with his wife, a soya production operator. Together they sold mainly soya and oyster sauces, bean paste and plum paste in bulk under the Sin Hwa Dee label to the restaurant, hotel and catering industries. In 1990, the company began producing the preserved fruits and vegetables used to make the traditional Lunar New Year dish of Yu Sheng. One of Sin Hwa Dee's factories is dedicated exclusively to the production of Yu Sheng products, while another factory produces noodles for the restaurant and catering industries. Mr. Chng's daughter Jocelyn first decided to introduce the company's products to the foreign market when she attended the SIAL exhibition in Paris in 1992, noting that there was a clear interest in Asian food. Sin Hwa Dee's first premix, the Laksa Paste, was launched into the food services market under the CHNG Kee's label in 1994, followed by the Kung Bo Sauce, the Black Pepper Sauce and their famous chicken rice mix. In 1996, the company invested heavily in equipment and technology to produce sauces and premixes in bottles for the retail market under the CHNG Kee's label.

Writers Guild of America member Steven Binder shows his approval as he votes Tuesday in Beverly Hills, California. More than 92 percent of the Writers Guild of America members who cast ballots Tuesday in Los Angeles and New York voted to end their work stoppage over residuals for writing in the digital age, including new media and the Internet. The new deal is for three years. \"The strike is over. Our membership has voted, and writers can go back to work,\" said Patric Verrone, president of the WGA's West chapter. Michael Winship, president of WGA's East guild, said, \"The success of this strike is a significant achievement not only for ourselves but the entire creative community, now and in the future.\" WGA members walked off the job November 5 after talks broke down over how writers are paid for the use of their material on the Internet and DVDs, among other issues. \"It is not all that we hoped for, and it is not all we deserve,\" Verrone said when a tentative deal was announced Saturday. But he added, \"This is the best deal this guild has bargained for in 30 years.\" Leslie Moonves, chief executive officer of CBS Corp., told The Associated Press, \"At the end of the day, everybody won. \"It was a fair deal and one that the companies can live with, and it recognizes the large contribution that writers have made to the industry.\" The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents production companies and media conglomerates, has had no comment on the agreement. The vote meant that the Academy Awards ceremony on February 24 will be the usual scripted gala, the AP reported. \"I am ecstatic that the 80th Academy Awards presentation can now proceed full steam ahead,\" without \"hesitation or discomfort\" for the nominees, Sid Ganis, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which stages the Oscars, told the AP. As long as the strike continued, the traditional Oscars spectacular was in doubt since many Hollywood stars would not cross WGA picket lines. It's unclear how soon new episodes of scripted programs will start appearing, because production won't begin until scripts are completed, the AP reported. It will take at least four weeks for producers to get the first post-strike episodes of comedies back on the air; dramas will take six to eight weeks, the AP said. Verrone said the WGA achieved two of three goals through negotiations with the studios.  Watch Verrone explain what he thinks the strike accomplished \u00bb . The first goal relates to writers' \"jurisdiction\" in new media, Verrone said, meaning that any content written by guild members specifically for new media, such as the Internet or cell phones, will be covered by their contract. The second goal relates to reuse of content in new media, Verrone said. The agreement bases payment for reuses on a distributor's gross formula for residuals, \"so that when they get paid, we get paid,\" he said. It is the \"first time in our history that a new delivery system pays on a residual formula superior to the prior existing system,\" Verrone said. The third goal, which Verrone said the guild did not achieve, was to shore up writers' shares of the revenue from animation and reality television. \"Giving up animation and reality was a heartbreaking thing for me personally,\" he said. \"But it was more important that we make a deal that benefited the membership, the town as a whole, that got people back to work and that solved the biggest problems in new media.\" E-mail to a friend .

CNN's Senior Vatican Analyst John L. Allen Jr. is following the pope during his U.S. trip. Pope Benedict XVI asked pilgrims in St. Peter's Square on Sunday to pray for the success of his U.S. trip. NEW YORK (CNN) -- The official motto of Pope Benedict XVI's April 15-20 visit to the United States, the first of his papacy, is \"Christ our Hope.\" Based on the frequency with which papal spokespersons have struck a different note, however, its unofficial motto might well be, \"This is not a political event.\" Here's a typical example from early April: \"The pope is not coming to get mixed up in the local political process,\" said Italian Archbishop Pietro Sambi, the pope's ambassador to America, in an interview with the National Catholic Reporter. \"His presence is about something more universal and, at the same time, more personal.\" Fear that Benedict's visit might be read through the lens of party politics reflects a key fact of electoral life in America: The \"Catholic vote\" matters. To take the most obvious example, if a few heavily Catholic counties in Ohio had gone the other way in 2004, pundits would today be handicapping the re-election of President John Kerry. America's almost 70 million Catholics, representing a quarter of the country's population, are diverse and divided. They don't all agree with official church positions, and although Catholics were once reliable Democrats, today they're not clearly aligned with either party. That's a key reason why states with large Catholic populations, such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida, are considered crucial battlegrounds. Already in the 2008 race, Catholics have made themselves felt. On the Democratic side, they're the biggest single reason Sen. Hillary Clinton is still afloat. So far, the more Catholic a state, the better Clinton has done. With her back to the wall not long ago in Ohio and Texas, Clinton decisively outpolled Sen. Barack Obama among Catholic Democrats. In Ohio, Clinton won the Catholic vote by a margin of 63 percent to 36, while in Texas it was 62 percent to 38. Clinton is now hoping that Catholics will come through for her again in Pennsylvania's April 22 primary. The state's 3.87 million Catholics represent more than 30 percent of the population, and Clinton is clinging to a lead despite Pennsylvania Sen. Robert Casey's endorsement of Obama. Casey is a hero to pro-life Catholic Democrats, and his backing is apparently helping Obama narrow the gap. Clinton does better than Obama among Latinos, who are disproportionately Catholic. She's also winning Catholic \"Reagan Democrats,\" meaning socially conservative blue-collar voters. Obama's recent gaffe, telling a crowd in San Francisco, California, that small-town Americans were \"clinging to guns or religion\" out of economic frustration, may help cement that advantage. Once the Democrats settle on a candidate, the Catholic vote seems wide open in November. Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, appeals to many Catholics because he's pro-life and has a moderate stance on immigration. Yet his willingness to remain in Iraq for \"100 years\" is at odds with the church's opposition to the war. Either Clinton or Obama could make a strong appeal to Catholics on peace-and-justice issues, yet both are out of sync with Catholic teaching on issues such as abortion, stem-cell research and gay rights. Both sides are expected to court Catholics aggressively. The McCain campaign recently formed a \"National Catholics for McCain Committee\" led by former Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback and former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, along with a \"who's who\" of prominent Catholic conservatives. Obama has his own \"National Catholic Advisory Council,\" led by Casey and former Indiana Rep. Tim Roemer, both pro-life Democrats. Clinton likewise has top-drawer Catholic advisers. Pope Benedict's trip is unlikely to offer a decisive boost to either side. He'll probably strike pro-life notes that Republicans can exploit, but he'll also likely accent peace, concern for the poor and the environment, issues that generally skew to the Democrats.  Watch as CNN's Rosemary Church speaks with Vatican analyst John Allen about the pope's visit \u00bb . Any political fallout may thus depend on what happens to the pope's message once it's swept up into the sausage grinder of American spin. Benedict XVI usually speaks not in sound bites but in carefully crafted paragraphs, which sometimes leaves the door ajar for competing explanations of what he really means. One can expect a \"war for the microphone\" among Republican and Democratic operatives, each looking to exploit pieces of the pope's message. In a tight race, movement of even a few percentage points among Catholics could be decisive. One sign the Democrats understand what's at stake is that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has arranged an April 16 conference call with reporters to comment on Benedict's trip -- in effect, not wanting President Bush, and by extension the Republicans, to claim a monopoly on the pope. All this makes the political implications of the pope's presence difficult to anticipate. The best advice boils down to that classic broadcast clich\u00e9: \"Stay tuned!\" E-mail to a friend .

Canadian soldiers walk along a track at the Kandahar Air Base in Afghanistan last month. Most of Canada's 2,500 troops in Afghanistan are in Kandahar as part of the NATO-led mission to stabilize the war-torn country. Their presence has sparked controversy in Canada, with the Bloc Quebecois and the New Democratic Party calling for an immediate troop withdrawal. Supporters of the mission argued that Canadians have made progress in providing schools, health care and clean water for thousands of Afghans. They said the improving conditions would be impossible without troops ensuring a secure environment for aid workers and local residents. \"The military needs to be there,\" said Harold Albrecht, a conservative member of Parliament. \"The military provides the civil order we would expect from police here.\" The Canadian mission in Afghanistan was to end next February. It has claimed the lives of 80 soldiers and a diplomat, according to The Associated Press. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has endorsed a panel's recommendation to keep troops in place only if another NATO nation dispatches additional troops to Kandahar. Canada wants a minimum of 1,000 reinforcements, The Globe and Mail reported. Thursday's motion, passed with a 198-77 vote, brought Harper's Conservative party and the opposition Liberals together on the issue. Other parties, however, noted that the cost of maintaining a troop presence in Afghanistan has not been disclosed to Parliament or the public. \"We must provide clarity to the Canadian people,\" said Nathan Cullen of the New Democratic Party. \"We believe it to be wrong for our country.\"  E-mail to a friend .", "0f60442453e038c6bbe3aa525bedf2a97f459e04": "(AOL Autos) -- Some drivers would say that the United States is a crazy quilt of speed limits, with an emphasis on the \"crazy.\" A sign indicating the highest speed limit in the country stands by Interstate 10 outside of the West Texas town of El Paso. Since 1995, states have been free to set their own maximum speed limits, leading to long debates on safety standards. To some folks, the speed limits are just insane -- either too low or too high, depending on their views about what makes driving safe. Advocates of low speed limits won't find much to like about Texas. True to its frontier roots, it stands out as the land of the fast getaway. The top rural speed limit is normally 70 mph, but in 2006 it set a maximum daytime speed of 80 miles per hour, the highest speed limit on the country, on more than 500 miles of rural interstate in its southwest corner. This includes parts of Interstate 10 between Kerrville and El Paso and of I-20 between Monahans and the I-10 interchange. The speed limit for rural roads in Montana is 75 mph. As a result, it takes just three hours to travel the 228 miles from Billings to Butte at the posted speed. But that's much slower than a Montana driver could have made the trip in early 1999. At that time there was a six-month speeders' honeymoon when the state had almost no control over rural speeds, partly as a result of an unfavorable court ruling. St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands is at or near the other end of the spectrum. In the U.S. territory the speed limit is 20 mph in the city and 30 out in the country. When it comes to accident rates, though, you would be far better off on a Montana interstate than competing with the island's frenetic drivers on the way to Paradise Point. Nationwide, maximum speeds range from 60 miles per hour in Hawaii to 75 in most of the West. Meanwhile, much of the eastern Midwest and the Northeast has opted for maximum speeds of 65 mph, although Michigan and Indiana chose the 70 mph standard more common to the South and the Great Plains states. So if you are cruising west along I-90 out of Ohio, you can enjoy the increase in speed across 150 miles of Indiana before Illinois' lower speed limit -- or its state police -- reins you in. As you continue west, interstate speed limits bump up to 70 in Iowa, and then you can maintain a steady 75 from Nebraska through to the California line, where interstate speeds drop off to 70 again. Should you choose to detour into Oregon, you're back down to 65. From a highway safety standpoint, the patchwork of speed limits at least seems to make sense. Speeds are slower in more populous Eastern states and faster in the wide-open West, although the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety argues that some of the new, higher speed limits out West and elsewhere are costing lives. It estimates that deaths on interstates and freeways have increased 15 percent due to the higher speed limits. But some researchers are skeptical about the link between accidents and high speeds on rural highways, if not on city streets and rural two-lanes. They point to the lower fatality rates on European highways, even though the speeds are generally higher. The maximum legal speed is roughly 80 mph in Poland, Austria, France and a few other countries. There is no speed limit on much of Germany's autobahn, although some sections are restricted to about 80 mph or less. Ironically, the new regime of U.S. speed limits has helped researchers make sense of whether higher rural speed limits are dangerous. Political scientist Robert Yowell, a professor at Northeast Lakeview College in Texas, examined what happened after states began setting higher rural speed limits in 1995. With the federal 65 mph limit gone, it was possible to compare the accident rates before and after the new limits went into effect. The results were clear: \"By and large, across the 50 states, there was no discernible effect from the higher limits,\" Yowell said. \"Two or three states actually had a decrease in fatalities.\" Once speed limits are raised on interstates, drivers are more likely to get off the more dangerous two lanes and use the faster routes, Yowell said. Furthermore, the motorists traveling the fastest on the higher-speed interstates tend to be good at that kind of driving. The less competent drivers at high speeds tend to drive more slowly. While Yowell admits most states are well-intentioned, he's \"not willing to accept that speed limits are solely a function of safety,\" he said. \"They are a function of revenue generation as well. There have been cases of judges saying communities have to raise their speed limits because they were obviously being used to raise revenues and that's not a proper use of the law.\" In part, Yowell looks to differences in political cultures to explain the great continental divide in speed limits. \"It may be that certain states have a different approach to questions involving personal liberty versus collective safety,\" he said. His research doesn't surprise Jim Baxter, president of the Waunakee, Wisconsin-based National Motorists Association. His organization had lobbied heavily for an end to the federal limits. Baxter's rule of thumb for computing the right speed limit is the traffic engineering standard known as the 85th percentile speed. That's the speed that 85 percent of motorists drive at or below. But it tends to be well above the speed limits that most jurisdictions set. With the speed limit set at that level, traffic tends to move smoothly, reducing the risk of accidents, Baxter said. If you put the limit below that speed, some vehicles are traveling far more slowly than the fastest drivers, creating the most dangerous conditions of all. Baxter argues that most drivers naturally tend to drive at speeds that suit the road conditions and their driving skills. St. Thomas is a case in point, albeit an extreme one. With its congestion and rugged terrain, the island is bereft of performance cars; many of the vehicles are older pickups, aging Japanese compacts and SUVs. The treacherous conditions restrict speeds far more effectively than any local law. As Joe Aubain, executive director of the St. Thomas-St. John Chamber of Commerce, puts it, \"Even if you wanted to go a whole lot faster, you couldn't,\" he said.

Math teacher Mawise Gumba fled Zimbabwe and found his qualifications mean little as a refugee. The tall 34-year-old, slouching exhausted in a Johannesburg church that has become a de facto transit camp, is one man in a tide of migrants washing up in South Africa. \"There is nothing for me there in our country any more. I had no job and I could not afford anything. Even when I was working life was tough,\" he said. \"It's hard for everyone ... I thought it was better for me here,\" said the former store clerk, whose dusty jeans and boots tell of a long and difficult journey. The tale told by Average -- whose name is not unusual in Zimbabwe -- is depressingly familiar to a people who have watched their once prosperous land spiral into economic disaster. When Mugabe's government, facing inflation of close to 5,000 percent, ordered companies to halve prices of basic goods and services a month ago -- effectively demanding that they operate at a loss -- Average lost his job as the supermarket chain he worked for cut staff. Facing the prospect of homelessness and hunger in his own country, he joined the estimated 4,000 Zimbabweans who head south to South Africa, most of them illegally, every day. Mugabe, 83 and in power since the country's independence from Britain in 1980, has been accused of running Zimbabwe's economy into the ground while implementing a draconian crackdown aimed at keeping power. His decision to launch violent seizures of white-owned farms seven years ago is partly blamed for soaring unemployment and the highest inflation rate in the world. Average scraped together his last salary, some money he made from trading sugar bought at a discount from the supermarket where he worked, and funds borrowed from friends to secure a visitor's visa and bus ticket to Johannesburg. A friend who promised to meet him on arrival failed to show up, leaving him stranded without a place to sleep. On Wednesday evening he walked into the Central Methodist Church in downtown Johannesburg and joined a long queue of people waiting for shelter and food. The church's homeless shelter has become a virtual refugee camp for 800-900 Zimbabweans and a smaller number of migrants from other countries. \"Over the past three years, and more so over the past couple of months, I have noted an exponential increase in the number of people we have from Zimbabwe,\" Bishop Paul Verryn said. Outside his office the line of people waiting for help grew. Many of the new arrivals were asleep in their seats. \"We offer them a place off the streets, where they are protected and have warmth from the inclement streets of Johannesburg,\" Verryn said. At sunset the refugees crowd into the building and lay out reeking blankets. \"People just sleep anywhere they can find a space to sleep. Some people sleep on the steps here, in the corridors and others in the foyer and in the meeting rooms,\" said 27-year-old Walter Rusike from Harare. The commerce graduate and his wife and two children share a meeting room with other families and have been at the shelter for four months. Average said he hoped to get accommodation for a few days until he finds his friend, work or both. \"I have a diploma in stores management and store control, a certificate in security and a driver's licence. I think maybe I will be able to find some work with my qualifications. Anything will be better than the situation I was in,\" he says.  E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

Mehdi Army militiamen celebrate after attacking an Iraqi Army vehicle in Baghdad's Sadr City on Sunday. Earlier Sunday, fighting between U.S. troops and the Mehdi Army militia loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr left at least 20 dead and 52 wounded in Baghdad's Sadr City, according to an Iraqi Interior Ministry official. The U.S. military said it had no information about the Sadr City fighting. Sunday's violence came as Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki demanded al-Sadr disband his Mehdi Army and threatened to bar al-Sadr's followers from the political process if the cleric refused.  Watch a report from the front line in Sadr City \u00bb . \"A decision was taken yesterday that they no longer have a right to participate in the political process or take part in the upcoming elections unless they end the Mehdi Army,\" al-Maliki said. Sunday's American fatalities bring the death toll of U.S. troops in the Iraq war to 4,022; that toll includes eight civilian contractors working for the Pentagon. Nearly 30,000 others have been wounded in action. An attack involving a \"couple of rounds\" of fire on the International Zone, also known as the Green Zone, killed two soldiers and wounded 17 others about 3:30 p.m., a military official said, declining to give the specific location of the attack for security reasons. A separate attack about 30 minutes earlier killed one soldier and wounded 14 at a U.S. military outpost in Rustamiya in southeastern Baghdad, the military said. Responding to al-Maliki's comments, a spokesman for al-Sadr, Sheikh Salah al-Obeidi, said that any effort to bar Sadrists from participation in politics would be unconstitutional -- and that any decision to disband the Mehdi Army is not the government's to make. \"It is up to the side that established it,\" he said. Al-Maliki spoke in an exclusive interview with CNN after a weeklong military offensive against what Iraqi officials called gangs and militia members in the southern Iraqi city of Basra. Hundreds were killed or wounded in the fighting across Iraq, which reportedly ended when Iranian and Iraqi Shiite officials held talks in Iran with al-Sadr. Asked about Iran's role in ending the Basra conflict, al-Maliki attributed the cease-fire to the work of his security forces. Haidar al-Abadi, an Iraqi lawmaker who belongs to al-Maliki's Dawa Party, said last week that Iranian officials participated in the discussions, and another source close to the talks said the Iranians pressured al-Sadr to craft an agreement. \"I am not aware of such an attempt,\" al-Maliki said Sunday. \"What happened on the ground and the breakdown in the structure of this militia is what made Muqtada al-Sadr issue his statement to withdraw his militants from the streets. What happened was something to save Muqtada, not to help us.\"  Watch al-Maliki talk about issues that concern Iraq \u00bb . In northern Iraq, security forces detained a suspect Sunday and were searching for others in connection with the kidnapping of 42 college students, authorities said.

Sen. Barack Obama defended himself and his wife against recent suggestions that they are not patriotic. After a town hall meeting in Lorain, Ohio, a reporter asked Obama about \"an attempt by conservatives and Republicans to paint you as unpatriotic.\" The reporter cited the fact that Obama once failed to put his hand over his heart while singing the national anthem. Obama replied that his choice not to put his hand on his heart is a behavior that \"would disqualify about three-quarters of the people who have ever gone to a football game or baseball game.\" The reporter also noted that the Illinois senator does not wear an American flag lapel pin, has met with former members of the radical anti-Vietnam War group, Weather Underground, and his wife was quoted recently as saying she never felt really proud of the United States until recently. Asked how he would fight the image of being unpatriotic, Obama said, \"There's always some nonsense going on in general elections. Right? If it wasn't this, it would be something else. If you recall, first it was my name. Right? That was a problem. And then there was the Muslim e-mail thing and that hasn't worked out so well, and now it's the patriotism thing. \"The way I will respond to it is with the truth: that I owe everything I am to this country,\" he said. The first-term senator from Illinois has been the subject of various debunked rumors since launching his presidential campaign -- allegations that he is a Muslim, that he took his oath of office on a copy of the Quran and that he attended a radical Islamic school while living in Indonesia as a boy. \"You will recall that the reason I came to national attention was a speech in which I spoke of my love of this country,\" said Obama. He and his wife, Michelle, had already explained her comments. \"She simply misspoke,\" he said. \"What she was referring to was [that] this was the first time she has been proud of politics in America.  Watch what Michelle Obama said \u00bb . \"That's true of a lot of people who have been cynical and disenchanted. And she's spoken about how she has been cynical about American politics for a very long time, but she's proud of how people are participating and getting involved in ways that they haven't in a very long time.\" About not wearing an American flag lapel pin, Obama said Republicans have no lock on patriotism. \"A party that presided over a war in which our troops did not get the body armor they needed, or were sending troops over who were untrained because of poor planning, or are not fulfilling the veterans' benefits that these troops need when they come home, or are undermining our Constitution with warrantless wiretaps that are unnecessary? \"That is a debate I am very happy to have. We'll see what the American people think is the true definition of patriotism.\" Obama did not respond to the question about the Weather Underground, a group whose members bombed the U.S. Capitol and the Pentagon during the 1970s. Last week, the New York Sun reported that as an Illinois state senator in 2001, Obama accepted a $200 contribution from William Ayers, a founder of the group who was not convicted for the bombings and now works as a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. But the paper said that, in a statement, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, William Burton, said, \"Sen. Obama strongly condemns the violent actions of the Weathermen group, as he does all acts of violence ... But he was an 8-year-old child when Ayers and the Weathermen were active, and any attempt to connect Obama with events of almost 40 years ago is ridiculous.\" Former first lady Sen.

Police remove a body from the scene. Italian Interior Minister Giuliano Amato said the shootings appeared to be linked to a feud between two mafia clans in the southern region of Calabria, home to the 'Ndrangheta organized crime group. Here are some key facts about the group: . ORIGINS: . -- The Calabrian \"Honored Society\", known as \"'Ndrangheta\", in the Calabria region of south Italy is the equivalent of the Sicilian Mafia. -- 'Ndrangheta began as a defense network for impoverished rural peasants against aristocratic landlords. Members emigrated to Canada and the United States, and were discovered running an intimidation scheme in Pennsylvania mining towns in 1906. HOW DOES IT WORK? -- They are known as \"The Honored Society\", Fibbia or Calabrian mafia. Instead of the pyramid structure of bosses used by other mafia, The 'Ndrangheta\" uses families based on blood relationships, inter-marriages, or being a Godfather. Each group is named after their village, or after the family leader. TWENTIETH CENTURY EXPANSION: . -- When Calabria began the process of industrialization and urbanization in the late 20th century, the 'Ndrangheta became interested in drug trafficking, weapons sales and public works and construction. THE PRESENT: . -- In 2004, authorities uncovered an international drugs trafficking network involving gangs in South America, Australia, and Europe. Drugs from Colombia were destined for countries such as Greece and Bulgaria. -- Italian officials estimated at the time that 80 percent of Europe's cocaine had arrived from Colombia via Gioia Tauro's docks in Reggio Calabria. -- Italian anti-organized crime agencies have estimated that the 'NDrangheta earns about $30 billion annually, mostly from illegal drugs, but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction, restaurants and supermarkets. -- There are believed to be about 100 'Ndrangheta families in Calabria, who have become more successful than their Sicilian counterparts because their family ties are closer.

Sumner was the centerpiece of the landmark 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education. The 11 sites represent the country's architectural, cultural and natural heritage, and \"reflect extraordinary periods of American history,\" National Trust Director Richard Moe said. The sites were chosen from about 70 nominees by the member-supported nonprofit group. Founded in 1949, it aims to protect significant buildings and locales, now protected under the 1966 Historic Preservation Act. Of the roughly 200 places listed by the organization in the past 20 years, the National Trust says only six have been lost. Moe said the list is designed to raise awareness. \"The 11 represent the different kinds of historic places in different parts of the country. It's a representative list,\" said Moe, who leads the organization of nearly 300,000 members. Endangerment doesn't necessarily mean the building is in the potential path of a bulldozer, according to Moe. Lack of funding can be just as serious, as the case of the California state parks demonstrates. The sites are listed in alphabetical order: . Boyd Theater, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania The Art Deco movie palace known as the Sameric was closed in 2002 and is for sale. A local group, Friends of the Boyd, is trying to save the 1928 theater, the last of its kind in Philadelphia. Only a few elaborate theaters from that era have survived, and the Boyd was the only one built in the downtown area. Moe said a \"sympathetic developer\" could restore the theater. California's park system The largest state park system in the United States suffers from chronic underfunding, including $1.2 billion worth of deferred maintenance, the National Trust said. The problem is worsening because of California's budget crisis. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger submitted a budget proposal this year that would have closed 48 parks, but the National Trust said the revised budget restored $11.8 million of the $13.3 million in cuts he requested. Current funds cover only 40 percent of maintenance and operations, which means irreplaceable historic and cultural resources remain endangered, the National Trust said. The system includes 278 parks, 1.5 million acres and 295 miles of ocean front. Many parks house historic buildings such as the 1820s-era Franciscan La Purisima Mission complex near Lompoc. Charity Hospital and adjacent neighborhood, New Orleans, Louisiana Charity Hospital, once the main trauma center for southeastern Louisiana, was closed after Hurricane Katrina swamped New Orleans in 2005. The building was declared unsalvageable, according to Donald R. Smithburg, chief executive of Louisiana State University Health Care Services Division, which operates university hospitals. There are plans to demolish nearly 200 homes in the Mid-City neighborhood to accommodate construction of two new hospitals. Alternate locations for the new hospitals are available, and Charity Hospital could be rehabilitated, according to the National Trust. Great Falls Portage, Great Falls, Montana This National Historic Landmark is one of the best-preserved landscapes along the Lewis and Clark Trail, but a massive coal-fired power plant is planned in the area. \"Development abutting the Great Falls Portage, an undeveloped rural area under panoramic blue Montana skies, will irreparably harm the cultural and visual landscape,\" the National Trust said . Hangar One, Moffett Field, Santa Clara County, California The hangar was built in 1932 to house U.S. Navy dirigibles. It is a cavernous, 200-foot-tall, dome-shaped structure sitting on more than 8 acres. A 2003 inspection revealed carcinogenic PCBs leaking from the hangar's metallic exterior, the National Trust said. PCBs were widely used in electrical transformers. The Navy transferred Hangar One to NASA in 1992. Although the Navy remains responsible for environmental remediation, it is not required to preserve the building. Lower East Side, New York The Lower East Side in southeast Manhattan was home for immigrants and the working class in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it is becoming gentrified. Development threatens historic churches, theaters, schools and tenements, \"a unique architectural type which, by the sheer numbers who lived in such a building, had an impact on more Americans than any other form of urban housing,\" the National Trust said. Michigan Avenue Streetwall, Chicago, Illinois This 12-block stretch of historic buildings along Michigan Avenue between 11th and Randolph Streets dates back to the early 1880s. The streetwall is a collection of notable buildings by architects including Adler & Sullivan, Louis Sullivan, D. H. Burnham and Holabird & Roche, the National Trust said. Although the stretch was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2002, the National Trust says its historic character is threatened by the inappropriate addition of large-scale towers that retain only small portions of the original buildings or their facades. Peace Bridge Neighborhood, Buffalo, New York The bridge and neighborhood, which has homes and buildings dating to the 1850s, includes two parks on the National Register of Historic Places that are part of Frederick Law Olmsted's park system. The Public Bridge Authority proposes to expand the bridge and build a 45-acre plaza that would destroy more than 100 homes and businesses, many of which are eligible for inclusion on the National Register, the National Trust said. According to the organization, the PBA has refused to \"properly consider\" other sites. The Statler Hilton Hotel, Dallas, Texas When the Statler Hilton opened in downtown Dallas in 1956, it was considered the most modern hotel in the country. Today, the vacant building sits on a desirable parcel of real estate. The Statler Hilton faces pressure from encroaching development that may lead to demolition. The National Trust says a sympathetic developer is needed to restore and reopen the hotel. Sumner Elementary School, Topeka, Kansas Sumner was the centerpiece of the landmark 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education. The court's decision that \"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal\" helped launch the civil rights movement by declaring school segregation unconstitutional. Vizcaya and the Bonnet House, Florida The development of out-of-scale buildings and corresponding zoning changes will ruin the vistas surrounding Vizcaya Museum and Gardens in Miami and the Bonnet House Museum and Gardens in Fort Lauderdale, the National Trust said. Such development could set a precedent for high-rise structures, it added.", "bad69c9a3c7d84a4717705a3063dd7367243772b": "(CNN) -- Panama City Beach, Florida, police are looking for a hotel security guard accused of raping an Alabama student and throwing her off a sixth-floor hotel balcony, a police spokesman told CNN. Police released this photo of Shawn Wuertly, who worked as a hotel security guard in Panama City Beach, Florida. The 18-year-old woman from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, remains hospitalized, but her injuries are not life-threatening, Lt. Dave Humphreys said. The incident happened early Monday at the Sandpiper Beacon Beach Resort in Panama City Beach during spring break. Police have issued an arrest warrant for Shawn Wuertly, 29, who worked as a security guard at the resort, Humphreys said. He is wanted for attempted felony murder, sexual battery and false imprisonment. Wuertly had been questioned by police regarding the attack, but they lacked the evidence to hold him, the spokesman said. The police investigation has found that the suspect had seen the girl \"several times\" at the hotel and had \"taken a liking to her at some point,\" Humphreys said. Around 1 a.m. on Monday, the suspect grabbed the woman and pulled her into an unoccupied room on the sixth floor, using his key to get in, Humphreys said. She said he sexually assaulted her and, after a brief altercation, threw her over the balcony, the police spokesman said. She hit two smaller roofs on her way down, which likely saved her from more serious injuries, before she came to rest in a second floor stairwell, Humphreys said. After his initial questioning, Wuertly told police he was leaving for Tennessee and would return on Wednesday. Wuertly has an outstanding arrest warrant, something that police did not discover until after he was released. \"Obviously no one checked his warrants because he has an outstanding warrant in Indiana,\" Humphrey said, noting that police are \"not happy and will address that.\" CNN's calls to the hotel's manager regarding Wuertly's outstanding warrant were not returned.

A witness said McWethy, 61, was skiing fast on an intermediate trail Wednesday at Keystone Ski Resort when he lost control and slammed into a tree, said Joanne L. Richardson, the Summit County, Colorado, coroner. McWethy died while being treated for blunt-force injuries at Summit Medical Center, Richardson said. \"He just missed a turn and slid sideways is what we're surmising,\" she told CNN. McWethy was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident, she said. With his wife, Laurie, McWethy recently had moved to Boulder after nearly 30 years as an ABC News correspondent, so he could enjoy Colorado's ski trails, according to a statement from ABC News President David Westin. \"He was doing something that he truly loved,\" Weston said. \"But he deserved many more years doing it than he was given.\" Friends and former colleagues described McWethy as an outstanding reporter who also cherished life outside work. \"He always knew without exception what so many in the powerful business of TV news fail to learn until it's too late: In the end, all we have is our families and our friends and our self-respect as news reporters,\" said CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr, who worked as a producer with McWethy for three years. Both Starr and former CNN producer Chris Plante admired McWethy's coolheaded reporting from the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, when a hijacked airliner punched a huge, fiery hole in the building's massive facade. \"He was unflappable even in the most extreme situations because he was always centered by his love for his family and the knowledge that the television news business and all of this Washington hoo-ha was not 'real life,' \" Plante said. \"Unlike so many, he really did have a handle on what life was for. And the last moments of his life are proof of that.\" College classmate Bob Steele wrote about McWethy's \"mighty\" skepticism of authority in an article published online for the Poynter Institute. While they attended Depauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, Steele said McWethy \"challenged the University President and his policies. He protested against the Vietnam War.\" Steele wrote that McWethy considered \"why\" to be \"the most powerful word in the English language.\" Len Ackland of the University of Colorado's Center for Environmental Journalism told The Denver Post that his longtime friend \"was a very humble guy.\" Ackland told the paper that McWethy \"didn't talk about himself much. He was the kind of journalist who didn't want to be out front. It was always about the story, not about him. He was the kind of guy you enjoyed sitting down to have a beer with.\" McWethy left behind two sons, Adam, 28, and Ian, 24, according to the Post. His wife, who was with McWethy at the time of the accident, told the Post her husband was a good skier who enjoyed living in Colorado. \"He loved it here,\" she told the paper. \"I think he loved the beauty of its nature, the open spaces, the wildlife, everything.\" In his statement, Westin said, \"He was one of those very rare reporters who knew his beat better than anyone, and had developed more sources than anyone, and yet, kept his objectivity.\" After working as a reporter for U.S. News & World Report, McWethy joined ABC News in 1979, going on to cover conflicts in Bosnia, Kosovo and Liberia, according to the ABC News Web site. McWethy was the network's primary reporter assigned to Secretaries of State James Baker, George Shultz, Warren Christopher and Lawrence Eagleburger, ABC said, and he had traveled to more than 50 countries. McWethy was honored with at least five national Emmys during his time at ABC and also received an Alfred I. duPont-Columbia Award and an Overseas Press Club Award, according to ABC News' Web site. \"For three years I watched one of the finest news reporters do what so many in television still cannot do to this day: be a reporter first, foremost and always,\" Starr said. Colleagues said he'll be missed. \"Everyone that knew Jack is trading stories today,\" Plante said. \"There is nothing but a sense of unambiguous loss on the part of all of his friends, colleagues, competitors and even the uniformed military officers that he covered as a reporter.\"  E-mail to a friend .", "c17a30b4c0f8f58e3afa6279a39470f65a179f6b": "LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Record oil prices, the sub-prime mortgage mess and slumping stock markets are hardly music to the ears of investors. In tough economic times like these, investors seek out safe, stable investments such as guaranteed government bonds or CDs. Yet a growing number are being wooed by the sweet sounds, and profits, of something new -- investment funds specializing in high-end musical instruments. The Stradivarius violin -- only about 700 are believed to exist -- is the premier investment instrument. Talented musicians want them, but can't afford them -- one fetched $3.5 million at auction. Enter Nigel Brown, winner of The Queen's Award for Enterprise and Chairman of the NW Brown Group, a financial services company. He brings musician and investor together. \"What happens is, a musician comes along to see me, having fallen in love with an instrument,\" Brown says. \"Then, what I do is to pull a syndicate of people together to buy this instrument so that the musician can then have the use of it ...\" Down the road, the musician can buy the instrument from the investors. They split the profits if its value appreciates. That's how violinist Matthew Trusler got his $2 million Stradivarius. Brown loved Trusler's playing and funded the instrument himself. \"They are just the most fantastic violins that were ever made,\" Trusler says, clutching his. \"This one was made in 1711 ... and it's been around for 300 years and it's a really wonderful violin.\" Not everyone is convinced a Stradivarius is such a great deal -- particularly modern instrument makers. \"I think if you can get hold of one of the very best Strads, not just any Strad ... I think they probably give you, as a player, something special,\" says violin-maker Andreas Hudelmayer. \"But if you can't have one of the very few best, you are just as well off with a new instrument.\" His reasoning? The cost of insuring a Stradivarius for just a couple of years would pay for a new, top-quality violin, Hudelmayer says. Even so, the reality is that old violins are attracting those looking for alternative investments. A new hedge fund called the Fine Violins Fund is dedicated to top-range instruments. The latest studies show exclusive violins are earning a steady 3.5 percent a year since 1850. That beats U.S. Treasury bonds over the same timeframe, with their 2.19 percent average yield. Of course, you have to be in the investment game for the long haul. \"They've proved to be fantastic investments,\" says Simon Morris, director of Beare's -- a broker and appraiser of high-end violins, violas and cellos. \"For many of the musicians that bought say in the 1960s, they've been the best pension plan they could've had. \"Like anything, you have to purchase well and sell well. You can't just go and buy any old thing.\" But for these investors, the financial return is only part of the investment. \"The fact they make a financial gain is of course gratifying at the end of the day, but it is mostly the support of the musician,\" says Brown. \"They like being able to go along to a concert and hear their instrument performed by their artist.\"  E-mail to a friend .", "6f579aad2d1f601b17e01057cd4b5e4942627230": "MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Buses that carry women only are experiencing a smooth ride with passengers in Mexico's capital. A woman rides on a bus exclusively for female passengers last month in Mexico City. Fans of the new service call their daily commutes more pleasant now that bus rides steer clear of too-close-for-comfort contact with men. \"We're not just talking about sexual harassment, about rapes or about incidents of violence,\" said Ariadna Montiel, director of the Network of Passengers' Transportation for the Government of the Federal District. \"But also about touching, staring, which is what generally occurs on public transport.\" The single-sex service, which started in January, is available on four major lines in the city, and it's expected to expand to another 15. Other plans include replacing male drivers with women. One woman described the service as \"excellent,\" saying it's \"more comfortable too because it doesn't make as many stops.\" Another passenger said she feels more comfortable and safer. Last year, the government received seven complaints of sexual abuse aboard the city's buses, which provide 200 million rides each year, officials said.  Authorities said that a single complaint is enough to justify taking such measures. Juan Flores, who has driven buses in Mexico City for 15 years and now steers one for women only, said he even notices a difference. \"I feel more tranquil, I work more peacefully and the interior of the bus is cleaner,\" he said.

Samuel David Crowe's death sentence was changed to life in prison by Georgia authorities, his attorney says. Crowe was convicted in 1988 of murdering Joseph V. Pala, the retail manager at Wicks Lumber Company in Douglas County. Crowe admitted to the crime. The board's ruling means Crowe's sentence will be changed to life without the possibility of parole. The board did not give a reason for its decision. When attorney Ann Fort called Crowe with the news, he was quiet. \"He was really shocked and relieved but very somber about it. He takes very seriously the deep harm that he caused when he committed this crime,\" she said. Crowe had a cocaine habit that his attorney says he kicked in prison. He spent his time behind bars counseling other inmates, teaching some of them to read and writing to people outside of prison who had drug habits. \"He didn't want them to go down the path he did,\" Fort said. As for the Pala family, they are devastated. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Pala's widow, Fran Pala, and his daughter, Lisa Pala-Hansen, were too upset to address the parole board. A representative spoke to the board on their behalf, the newspaper said. Crowe had been scheduled to be executed by injection at 7 p.m. ET Thursday at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson, 45 minutes south of Atlanta. He would have been the 19th inmate in Georgia executed by injection. William Earl Lynd was executed by injection the first week in May. He was the first inmate to die in the state since September, when the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider whether the three-drug combination represented cruel and unusual punishment. Lynd was convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend in 1988. The U.S. Supreme Court had effectively halted all executions in the country last September, when it agreed to consider whether the three-drug combination used by most states violated the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Death penalty opponents have argued that if inmates are not given enough anesthetic, they could be conscious enough to suffer excruciating pain without being able to express it because of the paralyzer. Their claims are supported by medical studies. Of the 24 death sentences the Georgia board has considered, Crowe's is the third it has commuted. Also this week, Mississippi executed murderer Earl Wesley Berry by lethal injection. Berry confessed to abducting Mary Bounds in 1987, beating her to death and then dumping her body in a rural road. The courts rejected Berry's attorneys' arguments that he should be spared because he was mentally retarded.

I-Reporter Alex Quinonez took this image of a casualty being taken by medics from Heathrow Airport. An investigator who has been briefed on the incident told CNN the plane's captain \"is claiming there wasn't power when he needed it.\" Passenger Paul Venter told the UK Press Association: \"The wheels came out and went for touchdown, and the next moment we just dropped. I couldn't tell you how far.\" London ambulance services said 17 people suffered minor injuries, and the number could increase as several others are still being assessed. Images showed the Boeing 777 -- BA flight 38 from Beijing, China -- grounded on tarmac after touching down several hundred meters short of the airport's south runway, close to a perimeter road, with its emergency chutes deployed and white fire-fighting foam covering the engines. The undercarriage, left wing and left engine of the aircraft were severely damaged, as if it had skidded across the ground. At least one of the plane's wheels had been torn off. The most visible damage was to the left wing, which was covered in mangled metal where it meets the fuselage. Tire tracks hundreds of meters long could be seen in the grass behind the plane, which was surrounded by fire engines and other emergency vehicles. Eyewitness Neil Jones said the plane had made a \"very, very unusual approach\" to the airport and sounded louder than usual, PA reported. \"You could see the pilot was desperate, trying to get the plane down. The aircraft hit the grass and there was a lot of dirt. The pilot was struggling to keep the plane straight. I think he did a great job.\" Read passenger and eyewitness accounts of the crash landing . The BBC said an unidentified Heathrow worker told the broadcaster that he had spoken to the pilot. The pilot said, according to the worker, that the plane's electronics had failed and that he was forced to glide it to the ground. The UK Air Accident Investigation Branch will lead the inquiry into the crash landing. A team from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is also heading to London, accompanied by representatives from Boeing and the Federal Aviation Adminsitration. Jerome Ensinck, a passenger aboard the flight, said there had been no indication that the plane was making an emergency landing. \"There was no indication that we were going to have a bad landing,\" he said. \"When we hit the ground it was extremely rough, but I've had rough landings before and I thought 'This is the roughest I've had.' \"Then the emergency exits were opened and we were all told we should go through as quickly as possible, and the moment I was away from the plane I started to realize that the undercarriage was away, and we had missed the runway. \"I feel lucky at the moment, but I think now I realize I've had a close call. If we had hit the runway, it would have been worse.\" In a statement, British Airways said all 136 passengers and 16 crew members had been evacuated from the plane with six minor injuries taken to hospital. BA chief executive Willie Walsh praised the actions of the crew. \"We are very proud of the way our crew safely evacuated all 136 passengers on board,\" Walsh said in a statement. \"The captain of the aircraft is one of our most experienced and has been flying with us for nearly 20 years,\" he added.  Walsh also said that an investigation was being conducted by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch and that it would be inappropriate to speculate about likely causes. Airport authorities said Heathrow's southern runway had been closed, but the northern runway remained open. But the incident immediately led to major delays for passengers. Some incoming flights were being diverted to other airports on a flight-by-flight basis, according to Heathrow's Web site. A spokesman for London's Metropolitan Police said there was nothing to suggest the incident was terror-related. The Boeing 777 is the mainstay of many airlines' long-haul fleets and has never been involved in a fatal accident. However, the aircraft involved in Thursday's incident appeared to have had a fortunate escape, having approached Heathrow over heavily-populated west London suburbs before its crash landing. CNN's Richard Quest, who covers the airline industry, said it appeared the damage happened after the plane touched down. The incident occurred at 12:42 p.m. (7:42 a.m. ET) as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown was due to leave Heathrow for a visit to China and India. His flight was delayed but his jet was not directly involved, PA said. \u2022 British Airways has set up helpline numbers for friends and relatives concerned for passengers involved in the incident: .

Before the Iraq war began, that figure was less than one suicide attempt a day. A U.S. soldier patrols the streets of Baghdad in January. The dramatic increase is revealed in new U.S. Army figures, which show 2,100 soldiers tried to commit suicide in 2007. \"Suicide attempts are rising and have risen over the last five years,\" said Col. Elspeth Cameron-Ritchie, an Army psychiatrist. Concern over the rate of suicide attempts prompted Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, to introduce legislation Thursday to improve the military's suicide-prevention programs. \"Our troops and their families are under unprecedented levels of stress due to the pace and frequency of more than five years of deployments,\" Webb said in a written statement.  Watch CNN Senior Pentagon Correspondent Jamie McIntyre on the reasons for the increase in suicides \u00bb . Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, took to the Senate floor Thursday, urging more help for military members, especially for those returning from war. \"Our brave service members who face deployment after deployment without the rest, recovery and treatment they need are at the breaking point,\" Murray said. She said Congress has given \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" to the military to improve its ability to provide mental health treatment, but said it will take more than money to resolve the problem. \"It takes leadership and it takes a change in the culture of war,\" she said. She said some soldiers had reported receiving nothing more than an 800 number to call for help. \"Many soldiers need a real person to talk to,\" she said. \"And they need psychiatrists and they need psychologists.\" According to Army statistics, the incidence of U.S. Army soldiers attempting suicide or inflicting injuries on themselves has skyrocketed in the nearly five years since the start of the Iraq war. Last year's 2,100 attempted suicides -- an average of more than 5 per day -- compares with about 350 suicide attempts in 2002, the year before the war in Iraq began, according to the Army. The figures also show the number of suicides by active-duty troops in 2007 may reach an all-time high when the statistics are finalized in March, Army officials said. The Army lists 89 soldier deaths in 2007 as suicides and is investigating 32 more as possible suicides. Suicide rates already were up in 2006 with 102 deaths, compared with 87 in 2005. Cameron-Ritchie, the Army psychiatrist, said suicide attempts are usually related to problems with intimate relationships, but they are also related to problems with work, finances and the law. \"The really tough area here is stigma. We know that soldiers don't want to go seek care. They're tough, they're strong, they don't want to go see a behavioral health-care provider,\" Cameron-Ritchie said. Multiple deployments and long deployments appear to exact a toll on relationships, thereby boosting the number of suicide attempts, she said. Traditionally, the suicide rate among military members has been lower than age- and gender-matched civilians. But in recent years the rate has crept up from 12 per 100,000 among the military to 17.5 per 100,000 in 2006, she said. That's still less than the civilian figure of about 20 per 100,000, she said. The \"typical\" soldier who commits suicide is a member of an infantry unit who uses a firearm to carry out the act, according to the Army. Post-traumatic stress disorder also may be a factor in suicide attempts, Cameron-Ritchie said, because it can result in broken relationships and often leads to drug and alcohol abuse. \"The real central issue is relationships. Relationships, relationships, relationships,\" said U.S. Army Chaplain Lt. Col. Ran Dolinger. \"People look at PTSD, they look at length of deployments ... but it's that broken relationship that really makes the difference.\" To reduce suicides, the Army said it is targeting soldiers who are or have been in Iraq for long periods and teaching them to notice signs that can lead to suicide. That training came too late for Army Specialist Tim Bowman. The 23-year-old killed himself in 2005 after returning from Iraq. \"As my family was preparing for a 2005 Thanksgiving meal, our son Timothy was lying on the floor, slowly bleeding to death from a self-inflicted gunshot wound,\" said his father, Mike Bowman, in testimony to a House Veterans' Affairs committee hearing in December. \"His war was now over.\" He said veterans return home to find an \"understaffed, under-funded, under-equipped\" Veterans Affairs mental health system. \"Many just give up trying,\" he said.

Former Chilean President Augusto Pinochet, pictured in 2000. The disappearances occurred between 1974 and 1975, during what was known as \"Operation Colombo,\" which targeted Pinochet's opponents. Chile's military government published information outside the country to make it seem that the victims had died fighting guerrillas. Chilean magistrate Victor Montiglio based his order on an investigation that says 60 victims were illegally arrested by the Office of National Intelligence (DINA) and kept in detention centers before they disappeared. DINA's former director, retired Gen. Manuel Contreras, has already been sentenced to 250 years in prison in other cases involving human rights violations. He found out about Montiglio's ruling in his prison cell. Minister of Justice Carlos Maldonado said the former soldiers will be taken to military compounds after they appear before Montiglio on Tuesday. The civilian suspects will be jailed in the Santiago Uno and Punta Peuco penal facilities, which are outside Santiago, he said. A U.S. backed-coup toppled democratically elected President Salvador Allende in 1973, after which Pinochet took power. In March 2008, a court in Chile sentenced 24 former police officers for their roles in kidnappings, torture and murders that happened just after the coup, Chile's Judicial Authority said. Thousands of Chileans were victims of the national crime wave. Pinochet, whose reign lasted from 1973 to 1990,  was widely blamed for encouraging subordinates to kidnap, torture and kill people with suspected leftist ties, such as journalists and union members. Years after he left power, courts indicted Pinochet in two human rights cases, but judges threw out the charges on the grounds that he was too ill to stand trial. Pinochet died in 2006.

Obama, however, may lose votes among Cuban-Americans if they think he is willing to talk with Ra\u00fal Castro, the president of Cuba who recently took over leadership of the island nation from his brother, Fidel Castro. Speaking in Miami on Tuesday, Sen.

That's not what I said, [and] John McCain knows it,\" he said. Obama also faulted McCain for pursuing what he called the failed Cuba polices of President Bush. \"Now, I know what the easy thing is to do for American politicians. Every four years, they come down to Miami, they talk tough, they go back to Washington, and nothing changes in Cuba. That's what John McCain did the other day,\" Obama said. \"He joined the parade of politicians who make the same empty promises year after year, decade after decade. \"Instead of offering a strategy for change, he chose to distort my position and embrace George Bush's and continue a policy that's done nothing to advance freedom for the Cuban people. That's the political posture that John McCain has chosen, and all it shows is that you can't take his so-called straight talk seriously.\" Republicans have been able to count on the support of southern Florida's Cuban American community by maintaining a no-compromise stance against Cuba's Communist regime.

But despite Democratic efforts to reach out to Cuban Americans, \"the reality is, there is no change,\" says Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Republican who has represented his South Florida district for eight terms.

Authorities found ricin, weapons and an anarchist manual in Roger Von Bergendorff's Nevada hotel room. Roger Von Bergendorff, 57, was indicted on charges of possession of a biological toxin, possession of unregistered firearms and possession of firearms not identified by serial number, said Natalie Collins, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Las Vegas, Nevada. Bergendorff was hospitalized for two months with suspected ricin poisoning, and was discharged before his arrest. His initial court appearance was last week, Collins said, and he did not enter a plea. An arraignment is scheduled for May 2. Bergendorff was hospitalized in February complaining of breathing difficulties. Two weeks later, Thomas Tholen, a cousin who went to Bergendorff's Las Vegas hotel room to recover his belongings, discovered what turned out to be ricin. Authorities also said a search of the room found four guns, the book \"Anarchist's Cookbook,\" a collection of instructions on poisons and other dangerous recipes and castor beans, syringes and beakers. Ricin is extracted from ground-up castor beans. Tholen was charged earlier in April with failing to report the commission of a crime. A federal grand jury indicted him for allegedly concealing the knowledge that production and possession of a biological agent -- a felony -- was being committed. Bergendorff previously lived in Tholen's home in Riverton, Utah, just south of Salt Lake City. After the ricin was discovered, the FBI searched that home as well as storage units Bergendorff used in Utah. Authorities said FBI agents searching the storage units found castor beans, chemicals used in the production of ricin, a respirator, filters, laboratory glassware, syringes and a notebook on ricin production. If convicted as charged, Bergendorff would face a sentence of up to 30 years in prison.

Yes, it is African,\" said Mugabe, whose speech Sunday was quoted Monday in The Herald, the state-run newspaper. \"You saw the joy that the British had, that the Americans had, and saw them here through their representatives celebrating and acting as if we Zimbabwe are either an extension of Britain or ...

The fallout from Zimbabwe's stalled election has brought international criticism, with Frazer taking the most emphatic stance. In April, Frazer accused Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe for nearly three decades, of \"trying to steal the election\" and \"intimidating the population and election officials as well.\" The first election was March 29. An announcement of the winner of the presidential election was delayed for weeks as opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai claimed he had won. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, after a long delay, ruled that neither candidate had won the required majority of votes, and scheduled a runoff election for June 27. Since the March balloting, there have been numerous reports from Tsvangirai's party and church groups about kidnappings, torture and other violence, including the deaths of opposition party members. They say the violence targets opponents of Mugabe and his Zanu-PF party. At about the same time Sunday that Mugabe was giving his campaign speech, Tsvangirai was speaking at a funeral.

Mancini guided Inter Milan to the Italian league title for three successive seasons. Ironically, the 43-year-old Mancini, who guided Inter to three successive Italian league titles, is now the favorite to take Mourinho's former job at Stamford Bridge. Inter -- who won the first of their three titles in 2006 because those above them were demoted or deducted points over the matchfixing scandal -- released a statement about the sacking. \"Inter Milan have informed Roberto Mancini that he has been relieved of his role as coach, especially because of his comments that he was not going to stay after the end of the season following the Champions League tie against Liverpool on March 11,\" read their statement. Mancini, however, rescinded those comments the following day declaring that he had made them in the heat of the moment following Inter's elimination from the competition, losing 3-0 on aggregate. Inter's reasons for sacking Mancini appear less credible after club president Massimo Moratti announced that the coach had changed his mind about leaving at the end of the season. \"I've had a talk with Mancini, who confirmed to me that he wanted to stay at Inter next year to see out his contract. He wants to win the Champions League for us next season,\" Moratti said on March 12. \"Mancini's words surprised me, I didn't expect it and even less so I believe the people close to him.\" Mourinho, nicknamed 'The Special One' for guiding Porto to the Champions League in 2004 and then Chelsea to two Premier League titles, would not come cheap, but the exit of Mancini has cost Inter dear too as his contract, which runs till 2012, will leave him 24 million euros richer as compensation. However, Mancini was unable to make Inter into viable Champions League contenders despite the three Serie A titles. Mancini is the ninth coaching casualty under Moratti, following Ottavio Bianchi, Roy Hodgson, Luigi Simoni, Mircea Lucescu, Marcello Lippi, Marco Tardelli, Hector Cuper and Alberto Zaccheroni.", "4f45a0576d353fa9b5b9d1c8e3cc0e6a1cd4897b": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- She's faced the glare of public life since she was a girl, but Chelsea Clinton must contend with renewed press scrutiny as she increasingly assumes a role in her mother's campaign for president. Chelsea Clinton accompanies her mother to the polls on Super Tuesday in Chappaqua, New York. The former first daughter always has been off-limits to the media, especially while she was growing up in the White House. But pressure to burst this protective bubble is likely to grow as the soon-to-be 28-year-old campaigns across the country for Sen. Hillary Clinton, even heading to Hawaii -- Sen. Barack Obama's home turf. Chelsea Clinton will spend three days there to strum up last-minute votes before the state's Tuesday caucuses, said a source from her mother's campaign. In the rough-and-tumble world of politics, her parents always have been protective of her -- including most recently after a TV correspondent's comment that the Clinton campaign found inappropriate.  Watch how controversy goes with the last name \u00bb . \"Doesn't it seem as if Chelsea is being pimped out in some weird sort of way?\" MSNBC correspondent David Shuster said this month about her reputed calls to superdelegates. Clinton communications director Howard Wolfson excoriated Shuster and called his remarks \"beneath contempt\" and disgusting. The senator from New York even sent a damning letter to NBC and demanded \"appropriate action.\" \"I am a mom first and a candidate second, and I found the remark incredibly offensive,\" she said. (Shuster was suspended indefinitely for the remark, made February 7 when he was a guest host for Tucker Carlson. MSNBC said Thursday that the suspension will end February 22.) Even a fourth-grader apparently can't get through to the press-shy Chelsea Clinton. Scholastic News \"kid reporter\" Sydney Rieckhoff was in pursuit of a story as she questioned presidential candidates last month on the campaign trail in Iowa, according to The Associated Press. Approaching Chelsea Clinton, she reportedly asked, \"Do you think your dad would be a good 'first man' in the White House?\" But Clinton wasn't talking. \"I'm sorry, I don't talk to the press and that applies to you, unfortunately. Even though I think you're cute,\" she said, according to the AP. During a campaign stop at the Luckie Food Lounge in Atlanta, Georgia, in mid-January, one supporter asked Clinton to reveal something that nobody else knew about her. She responded she would love to -- if all the cameras weren't around. Clinton has proven to be an effective campaigner for her mother, according to a campaign source, saying there's a strong correlation between her visits and improved performance. At this point, the campaign has become a fight for delegates, and even narrowing a loss has a big impact, a source said. This election cycle, Clinton campaigned for her mother in California, the first state where the senator won the youth vote. A rural congressional district in Nebraska where she campaigned reportedly outperformed others in the state. Politicians protecting their children from the spotlight is hardly new. The Bushes complained when daughters Jenna and Barbara became fodder for late-night comics and media outlets. Vice President Dick Cheney also has been reticent when it comes to his daughter Mary, who had a child with her lesbian partner. During a debate with Cheney in 2004, Democratic vice presidential candidate John Edwards broached the topic, saying, \"I think the vice president and his wife love their daughter. I think they love her very much. And you can't have anything but respect for the fact that they're willing to talk about the fact that they have a gay daughter.\" Cheney responded, \"Let me simply thank the senator for the kind words he said about my family and our daughter. I appreciate that very much. ... That's it.\" But the vice president later slammed Sen. John Kerry for his remarks about Mary Cheney when asked about homosexuality during a debate with President Bush. The vice president said Kerry was \"out of line;\" wife Lynne Cheney called him \"not a good man.\" These exchanges show that as Chelsea Clinton's public persona rises, so too will questions about why she doesn't make herself available to reporters. The Clinton campaign said Chelsea Clinton is trying to reach as many people as possible and has \"appeared in dozens of venues in more than 20 states.\" But she's still not granting interviews.

Investigators say a second male appears in the back seat in this ATM photo, which has been colorized. Police on Saturday released photos taken by an ATM camera that show a young man driving a sport utility vehicle possibly using one of student Eve Carson's ATM cards in the Chapel Hill area. A large, shadowy form appears in the back seat of the vehicle, which police say may have been Carson's. Carson, 22, was found shot to death early Wednesday in a suburban neighborhood near the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill campus. Her Toyota Highlander was found the next day in another neighborhood to the west, close to where she lived with roommates. \"We do believe there is a second unidentified male seated in the rear seat,\" the Chapel Hill Police Department said in a statement. \"We have been exploring ways to enhance the quality of this photo in an effort to learn more about this person.\" Police have not identified the pictured driver, who was wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a vintage Houston Astros baseball cap. Chapel Hill Police Chief Brian Curran said Saturday that Carson's killing \"feels like a random crime.\" The medical examiner told police that there were no injuries to Carson's body besides gunshot wounds and no signs of sexual assault, Curran said. On Sunday, more than 1,000 people crowded the First United Methodist Church in Carson's hometown of Athens, Georgia, for her funeral, the Athens Banner-Herald reported. The University of North Carolina will hold a memorial service for Carson after students return from this week's spring break, Chancellor James Moeser said in a statement on the school's Web site.

Barack Obama as she faces what even her supporters admit are must-win situations in Texas and Ohio in the weeks ahead. At a campaign stop at a General Motors Corp. plant in Youngstown, Ohio, the senator from New York accused Obama of caving in to special interests. \"My opponent says that he'll take on the special interests,\" she said. \"Well, he told people he stood up to the nuclear industry and passed a bill against them. But he actually let the nuclear industry water down his bill -- the bill never actually passed.\" Clinton was referring to a 2006 bill that Obama drafted after an Illinois nuclear power plant was found to have released radiation into surrounding groundwater. Obama's original bill would have required power plants to notify the public and government officials when any radiation was released, but subsequent versions had less stringent reporting requirements, The New York Times reported. The bill was never voted on by the full Senate. Clinton also accused Obama of supporting \"billions of dollars of breaks for the oil industry\" by voting for an energy bill she opposed and said he did not support the workers of a Maytag Corp. plant that closed in his home state of Illinois.  Watch Clinton attack Obama \u00bb . Reacting to Clinton's charges, Obama spokesman Bill Burton said his candidate \"doesn't need any lectures on special interests from the candidate who's taken more money from Washington lobbyists than any Republican running for president.\" \"Sen. Clinton may have said that attacks and distortions are the 'fun' and 'exciting' part of the campaign, but they're exactly what everyone else in America is tired of,\" Burton said. In recent days, Clinton has challenged Obama's ability to deliver on his rhetoric. \"There's a big difference between us -- speeches versus solutions, talk versus action,\" she said. \"Speeches don't put food on the table. Speeches don't fill up your tank or fill your prescription or do anything about that stack of bills that keeps you up at night.\" Her remarks in Ohio echo statements she made a day earlier in McAllen, Texas, when she said, \"I am in the solutions business. My opponent is in the promises business.\" Clinton was set later Thursday to hold events in Dayton and Columbus, Ohio. Obama was to be in his hometown of Chicago, Illinois, and had no public events scheduled. CNN contributor and Clinton supporter James Carville said the senator must do well in the March 4 Ohio and Texas primaries if she is to stop Obama's momentum. Carville said he thought Clinton could still win the nomination. \"You know, this thing is close. Not all the Democrats have been heard from. ... If anybody can do this, I think she can,\" said Carville, a major force behind President Clinton's successful 1992 campaign. Clinton's aggressive stance may be in reaction to Obama's momentum after he won eight contests in a row -- including victories by wide margins in Tuesday's primaries in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia.  Watch how the so-called Potomac primaries put Obama on a roll \u00bb . In those contests, Obama also outpolled Clinton among demographic groups she had carried earlier -- women, lower-income voters and Latinos. Clinton is banking on those groups to carry her to victory in Texas and Ohio. The wins in the Potomac primaries gave Obama a lead over Clinton in the delegate count for the first time -- 1,253 to 1,211, according to CNN calculations. \"In my neighborhood, you know, you had to win games if you wanted to brag,\" said Jamal Simmons, a Democratic strategist and Obama supporter. \"And I think right now, Barack Obama is ahead in delegates. He's ahead in states. He's ahead in the popular vote. He's winning. \"Sen. Clinton has got to win some of these contests, you know, to get to the finals.\" Neither Clinton nor Obama is likely to pick up the 2,025 delegates needed to win the nomination outright before the primary season ends in June, mainly because Democrats divvy up each state's delegates in proportion to the candidates' share of the popular vote.  Watch an outlook of the Democratic race \u00bb . The Democratic nomination likely will be decided by the roughly 800 superdelegates, which include party officers, elected officials and activists. Obama's camp argues the superdelegates should support the candidate with the most popular support, as indicated by a majority of pledged delegates going into the convention. Clinton's campaign, on the other hand, says the superdelegates should support the candidate they think will be the best nominee in the general election as well as the best president.  Watch how the campaigns are fighting for superdelegates \u00bb . MoveOn.org, an influential liberal activist group, on Thursday said it would launch a petition drive calling on the superdelegates not to go against the popular vote. \"The worst thing for the party and democracy is if all these new voters feel like the nomination was brokered in a backroom somewhere. The superdelegates have got to let the voters decide,\" MoveOn.org Executive Director Eli Pariser said in a statement. MoveOn.org has endorsed Obama. In a possible indication that Clinton is going to fight for every delegate, her camp on Thursday announced that daughter Chelsea Clinton would be dispatched to Hawaii to campaign before the state's primary Tuesday.  Watch how each campaign is fighting for delegates \u00bb . However, Chelsea Clinton may face an uphill battle there since Hawaii is Obama's native state. Bill Clinton on Thursday was scheduled to campaign in Wisconsin, which also holds its primary Tuesday. Recent polls in that state have shown a tight race between the two Democrats. A Strategic Vision survey conducted February 8 through Sunday finds Obama ahead of Clinton 45 percent to 41 percent, a lead outside the poll's margin of error of 3 percentage points. Carville said Clinton could recover from a loss in Wisconsin. \"It certainly would be preferable for her to win Wisconsin, but I don't put it in the same category as I would put Texas and Ohio on March 4,\" he said.

Gerolsteiner has invested around $12 million annually in the team, which includes riders Stefan Schumacher, Fabian Wegmann, Markus Fothen and Robert Foerster.

Bernucci violated the team's code of conduct and was removed from T-Mobile's roster at the Spanish Vuelta, the team said on Tuesday. He tested positive for a non-amphetamine appetite suppressant. Bernucci is licensed by the Monaco cycling federation, which will be responsible for further investigation and possible additional sanctions, T-Mobile said. He tested positive on August 15 for the substance sibutramine, an appetite suppressant sold under various brand names, such as Reductil and Ectiva.

Bernucci told team management that he had been using Ectiva for four years and had purchased it over the counter at a pharmacy in Italy, not knowing it been added to the list of prohibited substances by the World Anti-Doping Agency, T-Mobile said. According to UCI rules, a first violation for sibutramine -- if it is determined that it was not intended as a performance enhancer -- can result in anything between a warning and a one-year suspension. \"We do not know if this was an attempt at performance enhancement or just poor judgment,\" T-Mobile team chief Bob Stapleton said. \"But we know it is unacceptable that riders take any medication without the approval of the team doctor.

At 11 p.m., the center of Arthur was over the southern Yucatan Peninsula, about 80 miles (125 km) west of Chetumal, Mexico, and about 120 miles (195 km) south-southeast of Campeche, Mexico. It was moving west at about 7 miles (11 km) per hour. The storm's maximum sustained winds were near 40 mph (65 km/hr), with higher gusts, mainly over water east of its center. Tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 260 miles (415 km) from the center of the storm, forecasters said. The government of Belize issued a tropical storm warning for the nation's coast, and the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Cabo Catoche south to the border with Belize. A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area -- in this case, within the next six to 12 hours. The storm was forecast to dump up to 10 inches of rain over Belize, up to 15 inches in isolated areas, the hurricane center said. The 2008 Atlantic hurricane season begins Sunday. On Thursday, Tropical Storm Alma, the first one of the year in the eastern Pacific, formed near the west coast of Central America, according to the National Weather Service. The storm was downgraded to a tropical depression and dissipated over the high terrain of Central America. The federal government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted this month that the Atlantic season would be more active than normal, with up to 16 named storms and up to five major hurricanes of Category 3 or above. The noted Colorado State University hurricane forecasting team predicted this year that there would be 15 named storms, eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes. The team calculated a 69 percent chance that at least one major hurricane will make landfall on the U.S. coast. A survey released this week found that 50 percent of 1,100 adults surveyed in Atlantic and U.S. Gulf Coast states did not have disaster plans or survival kits. \"Nearly one in three said they would not prepare their home until a storm is within 24 hours of landfall,\" Bill Read, director of the National Hurricane Center, said Thursday. \"Now is the time to buy all that stuff,\" he said upon the release of the survey by polling firm Mason-Dixon.", "e5e837f2cc75fc44ebf826822aa4c9dc59344b8b": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Imams delivering their Friday sermons in Iraq are denouncing the shooting of a Quran, the holy book of Islam, by a U.S. soldier.

Ruben Navarrette Jr. notes that immigrants have been criticized throughout history for not assimilating. They have convinced themselves that, instead of adapting to the customs of this country, new arrivals -- most of whom come from Asia or Latin America -- expect the rest of us to accommodate them. They go ballistic over little things -- Mexican flags, taco trucks, libraries that offer bilingual story time, or having to \"press one for English.\" Yet, even as they look down on new immigrants, many Americans look back fondly upon their immigrant ancestors. Legend has it that when grandpa arrived from Ireland, Germany, Italy or Poland, he jumped off the boat, immediately draped himself in the American flag, ripped out his native tongue, and abandoned his culture -- all while singing \"Yankee Doodle Dandy.\" Germans did not move to Milwaukee and make beer and cheese. The Irish did not settle in Boston and join organizations like the Hibernian Society to preserve their heritage and culture. And even while Americans complain about how the current crop of immigrants aren't like their predecessors, they miss the irony: At the time, there were people who said the same thing about their ancestors; the Germans were thought to not be like the English, the Irish weren't like the Germans, the Italians weren't like the Irish etc. And the Chinese weren't like anyone who had come before them, and so they were labeled \"unassimilable\" by the Tom Tancredos of that era. Some things never change. When I was growing up in Central California, which is home to a large population of immigrants from Southeast Asia, thousands would gather to celebrate Hmong New Year. The local newspaper would do a feature. And, in the days that followed, someone would write an angry letter to the editor complaining that these people weren't melting into the pot. Yet, there is more melting going on than one might think, according to a new report from the Manhattan Institute. Billed as the first annual Index of Immigrant Assimilation, the study was written by Duke University Professor Jacob Vigdor. It measured three kinds of assimilation: economic (employment, education, homeownership, etc.); cultural (intermarriage, English proficiency, family size, etc.); and civic (citizenship, military service, political participation, etc.). Far from discovering that recent immigrants are ducking the assimilation process, the study found that \"immigrants of the past quarter-century have assimilated more rapidly than their counterparts of a century ago, even though they are more distinct from the native population upon arrival.\" Of course, individual groups still fall behind in some categories. Chinese and Indian immigrants have low levels of cultural assimilation. Mexican immigrants have low levels of economic assimilation. And Canadian and Indian immigrants have low levels of civic assimilation, since few of them become citizens. But, overall, the news is good. After more than 200 years, America still does an excellent job of assimilating immigrants. Even if a particular group tried to resist the process, they wouldn't stand a chance. Assimilation happens, whether the immigrants are ready or not. Those are the facts. Of course, fear doesn't listen to facts. That is something else that hasn't changed.

These pills were sent to CNN's Drew Griffin, even though he was never seen by a doctor. Every night before her husband went to bed, he would open a prescription bottle of the muscle relaxant Soma and swallow the eight or nine pills it took for him to fall asleep, said the woman.  She spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity because she wants to protect her husband's identity and not embarrass his family. The drugs arrived at their doorstep every week. She thought they were being prescribed by a treating physician. Her husband had been in a car accident and suffered back pain, and Soma was the one drug that could relieve the aches. She was wrong. The drugs were purchased online without a doctor's visit. She says that her husband had become an addict -- and that the Internet sites that sold him the drugs were his pushers. \"Absolutely,\" she said. \"That's exactly what they are.\" \"These pharmacy people that are doing this and these doctors that are doing this, they don't give a dadgummit about people. It's just the almighty dollar; that's all it is.\" Rusty Payne, a spokesman with the Drug Enforcement Administration, agreed. The abuse of pharmaceuticals \"is one of the biggest drug problems we are dealing with,\" he said. \"The Internet is the biggest culprit,\" Payne said. About $39 million in cash, bank accounts, property and computers were seized in 2007 as a result of Internet drug investigations, he said. In 2004, the figure was $11.9 million. The DEA has formed an initiative with Google, Yahoo! and AOL to warn people about buying drugs online. Between 2005 and 2007, Payne said the official warning popped up nearly 80 million times. A CNN investigation shows just how easy it is to purchase prescription drugs online without a legitimate prescription, revealing a growing new battle in the war on drug abuse.  Watch why 'I wanted to end it' \u00bb . To prove it, a CNN investigative reporter went to linepharmacy.com, which advertises a long list of prescription drugs for sale. The site sent back an e-mail saying \"all orders made are still subjected to Doctor's evaluation.\" The reporter placed two orders for anti-depressants with the site: one for Prozac, the other for Elavil. A health survey on the site was already filled in. The reporter submitted a credit card and a shipping address. Within 24 hours, the Prozac had arrived at the reporter's front door. The Elavil arrived two days later. Both prescription bottles had a doctor's name and pharmacy on the label.   Watch woman describe online drug 'Christmas' sales \u00bb . The reporter had neither seen a doctor nor talked to a doctor on the phone. In fact, he hadn't even heard of the doctor listed on the bottle. Carmen Catizone, the executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, which works to implement and enforce uniform pharmaceutical standards, said prescription drugs are the new crack and heroin, and Internet sites that sell them are the new drug dealers. Except narcotics, Catizone said, \"you can order virtually any drug in the world by simply clicking a mouse and going to various Web sites that exist out there.\" His group blames unscrupulous doctors for writing prescriptions without ever seeing the patients or even reviewing their medical records. It has created a list of nearly 80 sites selling online drugs that it recommends people not use. It is illegal in every state for doctors to prescribe medicines to patients whom they do not know across state lines. It is also illegal in most states for pharmacies to ship prescriptions to where they have no license to operate. The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy has tried to lobby Congress, asking for some federal oversight or federal prosecution to stem the tide of illegal Internet pharmacies. But Catizone says legislators gave the board a chilly response: \"'Show us the dead bodies,' and if that was me or my family, that's a pretty sad statement for our legislators to give.\" It is unknown just how many people have died from overdoses related to these online drug sales. It is also unknown how many people have tried to commit suicide with drugs bought online, as Nancy Fitzpatrick of Washington state tried to do earlier this year. She showed CNN her prescription for Soma. The drugs were delivered by a pharmacy in American Fork, Utah, and prescribed by a doctor in Long Island, New York. \"I wanted to end it, I wanted to die,\" \"Fitzpatrick said, describing how she swallowed about 130 pills after she fell into a deep depression.

Barack Obama's Democratic presidential rivals blasted him for his remarks about Pakistan. Last Wednesday, the Illinois senator said that if it were necessary to root out terrorists, he would send U.S. forces into Pakistan without the country's approval. \"You can think big, but remember, you shouldn't always say everything you think if you're running for president, because it has consequences around the world,\" Sen. Hillary Clinton said during a 90-minute Democratic presidential forum in Chicago sponsored by the AFL-CIO. Chicago is Obama's hometown, and Clinton's statement drew boos. The New York senator responded, \"We don't need that right now.\" Despite the frosty reception, Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd joined Clinton in criticizing Obama. He said Obama's stance could undermine Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, the country's military ruler, who has been a U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda. \"While General Musharraf is no Thomas Jefferson, he may be the only thing that stands between us and having an Islamic fundamentalist state in that country,\" Dodd said. \"So while I would like to see him change, the reality is, if we lose him, then what we face is an alternative that could be a lot worse for our country.\" Obama jumped into the fray. \"I find it amusing that those who helped to authorize and engineer the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation are now criticizing me for making sure that we are on the right battlefield and not the wrong battlefield in the war against terrorism,\" he said. \"If we have actionable intelligence on al Qaeda operatives, including [Osama] bin Laden, and President Musharraf cannot act, then we should,\" Obama said. \"That's just common sense.\" He also said Americans had the right to participate in the debate over such a key aspect of American foreign policy. But Clinton countered by saying that while U.S. forces might have to pursue action inside Pakistan \"on the basis of actionable intelligence,\" it was \"a very big mistake to telegraph that and to destabilize the Musharraf regime, which is fighting for its life against the Islamist extremists who are in bed with al Qaeda and the Taliban.\" \"Remember, Pakistan has nuclear weapons. The last thing we want is to have al Qaeda-like followers in charge of Pakistan and having access to nuclear weapons.\" Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware responded later in the debate, noting that the strategy Obama outlined was already U.S. policy. \"Everyone's entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts,\" Biden said. \"It's already the policy of the United States -- has been for four years -- that there's actionable intelligence, we would go into Pakistan.\" E-mail to a friend .", "6a985a1090f146976d33c8b33342320a65a50211": "(CNN) -- The U.S. military is promising action to address conditions in a barracks at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, after a soldier's father posted images on YouTube showing a building that he said \"should be condemned.\" A soldier battles overflowing sewage in the Fort Bragg barracks shortly after coming home from Afghanistan. \"This is embarrassing. It's disgusting. It makes me mad as hell,\" Ed Frawley said of the building where his son, Sgt. Jeff Frawley, had to live upon his return this month from a 15-month deployment to Afghanistan.

The rules say only farmers, livestock owners and certified rodent control employees can buy rat poison in bulk. \"We are very happy that the EPA has done all it can to get these products off of the consumer market,\" said Michael Fry, director of conservation advocacy for the American Bird Conservancy. \"By putting these restrictions in place, they are allowing a compromise to be made between themselves and organizations who have been working on this problem for a long time.\" The EPA's new measures, which were handed down Thursday, require that rat poisons be kept in bait stations above ground and in containers that meet agency standards. Loose bait, such as pellets, and the four most hazardous types of pesticides, known as \"second-generation anticoagulants,\" will no longer be sold for personal use. Under the new restrictions, only farmers, livestock owners and certified rodent control employees will be allowed to purchase rat poison in bulk. Bags larger than 8 pounds will no longer be sold at hardware and home-improvement stores. Children who come into contact with highly toxic pellets can experience terrible symptoms from digesting them. They include internal bleeding, nosebleeds, hair loss and extensive bruising. Between 2001 and 2003, rat poison was responsible for nearly 60,000 poisonings, according to a study done by the American Association of Poison Control Centers. About 250 of these yearly exposures result in serious injuries or death. The EPA said it believes the restrictions will not only keep the products out of children's hands, but also reduce the ecological and wildlife risks associated with exposure to rat poison. Bait blocks that are typically placed on the ground use fish and other flavors that attract endangered species, including mountain lions. \"In California, almost every animal tested by the National Wildlife Service had residues of rodenticides,\" said Fry. \"The rat baits are also very lethal to scavengers, because the toxins remain in the rodent's body long after they initially die.\" Although the EPA is receiving considerable praise for the initiative, this isn't the first time the agency has worked to combat the threat of rat poison. In 1998, the EPA established two standards for rat poison. The agency required manufacturers to include an ingredient that made the poison taste bitter and use an indicator dye that would make the ingestion of pesticides more recognizable. But regulations were revoked in 2001 after the agency came to a mutual agreement with manufacturers to rescind the requirements. \"We determined that the dye wasn't effective in keeping children from being accidentally exposed and the bittering agent actually resulted in a loss of efficiency in controlling rodents,\" said Steven Bradbury, director of the agency's Division of Special Review and Re-registration. \"In our decision Thursday, we felt that we needed an approach that would stop children coming in contact with the pesticides in the first place. That ultimately led to the implementation of bait stations,\" Bradbury said. The decision to revoke the requirements led the West Harlem Environmental Action, Inc. and the Natural Resource Defense Council to file a lawsuit three years later. Both organizations saw the retraction as a way to make it easy for consumers to purchase unsafe rodenticides over the counter. According to the West Harlem group, inner-city housing and park departments such as the New York City Housing Authority could continue laying rat baits in public areas that were easily accessible to children. \"Studies show that the number of poisonings in minority children is much higher than others,\" said Aaron Colangelo, a staff attorney at the Natural Resource Defense Council. \"Not only do we have an environmental health issue, but an environmental justice issue as well.\" New York State Health Department studies showed that 57 percent of children hospitalized for rat poisoning were black and 26 percent were Latino. The EPA said it is working to reduce those numbers in upcoming years with regulations like the ones it introduced this week. \"We were frustrated that the EPA dragged their feet for three years before finally taking some productive steps,\" said Colangelo. \"But, from our perspective, they are finally starting to do what needs to be done in order to protect children.\" After June 4, rat poison manufacturers will have 90 days to comply with the EPA's guidelines. They will then have the opportunity to design new bait stations and formulas for their poisons. All new products should be registered and certified by June 2011.", "22e0c9ba3465840583a5fd79714d2f7663c7e3a1": "(CNN) -- Suspected Islamic insurgents fired mortar rounds at a plane carrying Somalia's transitional president, but no one -- including Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed -- was harmed, a presidential spokesman said.

Al-Shaabab is an Islamic militia that is trying to seize control of Somalia. It is a splinter group of the Islamic Courts Union, which ousted Somalia's transitional government in 2006. The ICU was deposed in December of that year following Ethiopia's military invasion. Bloody battles between Al-Shaabab and the Ethiopian-backed government forces in Mogadishu have forced residents to flee the capital. More than 40,000 displaced civilians have taken shelter in dozens of makeshift settlements west of Mogadishu, described by the United Nations as \"precarious conditions.\" Sunday's mortar attack is the second assassination attempt on Ahmed. The president survived a car bombing in September 2006 outside Somalia's parliament in Baidoa that killed at least eight others. Somalia's Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi has been more frequently targeted by the Islamic insurgents seeking to destabilize the government. Somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991, when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and sparked brutal clan infighting. Somalia's current transitional government is trying to maintain control of the capital, with the help of the better-equipped Ethiopian forces. But the presence of the Ethiopians has united various Islamic militant groups in Somalia, including Al-Shaabab, who are trying to oust the Ethiopian forces and gain control of Mogadishu.

Michelann Ooten, spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management, said the town enlisted firefighters from surrounding areas who went house-to-house in a 20-block area, sifting through rubble and searching for survivors. \"It looks like a war zone,\" she said. \"Some homes have fallen in, some homes have lost roofs and some are now just slabs.\" Freelance journalist Mike Priest went to a heavy-hit neighborhood in Picher on Sunday, surveying an area where almost all the houses were leveled. All the residents had evacuated leaving behind, cars, clothes and even their pets, Priest said. \"As you can see some people's pets have been left behind and they are fighting over some food,\" he said, shooting footage of the scene. \"Just total devastation. Houses wiped all the way down to the foundation. You can see what used to be a house in the driveway. The storm was incredibly, incredibly strong right through here.\" CNN's Lee Garen, Susan Candiotti and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.", "75da85a72e0028e1b07c65f6b771a1eaa20b4e04": "(CNN)  -- Brendon Pelser said he saw pure terror in the faces of his fellow passengers after an engine fell from a wing as it took off from Cape Town, South Africa, Wednesday. Men were sweating profusely, women were crying. \"There was fear on their faces,\" Pelser said. \"Everyone started panicking.\" But the pilot of Nationwide Airlines' Boeing 737 Flight CE723 was able to fly long enough to dump fuel and make an emergency landing at Cape Town International Airport. Including crew, 100 hundred people were on the plane that departed at 3:50 p.m. on an hourlong flight to Johannesburg, South Africa. No one was injured. The jet had only been in the air about 10 minutes before the engine fell. \"We heard something crash and bang, the plane veering left and right. A person on the right side said the engine was missing -- had broken clean off,\" said Pelser.  Watch Pelser describe how the flight crew told passengers to \"prepare for the worst\" \u00bb . \"They flew us in very slowly. We were all prepared for the worst. We went into the fetal position, head between the legs,\" he said. \"Then we hit the runway.\" \"I did kind of pray. I didn't want to die. I'm not really ready to die,\" the 33-year-old said. An object had been sucked into the engine as the nose wheel lifted from the ground and officials are trying to identify it. The engine-to-wing supporting structure is designed to release an engine \"when extreme forces are applied,\" to prevent structural damage to the wing, Nationwide said on its Web site. The airline described the incident as a \"catastrophic engine failure.\" As the nose wheel lifted from the ground, \"the captain heard a loud noise immediately followed by a yaw of the aircraft (sideways slippage) to the right,\" the airline said in a news release. The flight instruments showed the No. 2 engine on the right side had failed, it said. Pelser said he spent the night in Cape Town, then flew back to Johannesburg where he lives, on the same airline. Nationwide said the engine had undergone a major overhaul in March 2005 at \"an approved Federal Aviation Authority facility in the U.S.A.\" and had flown only 3,806 hours since then. \"These engines typically achieve 10,000 hours between major overhauls,\" Nationwide Airlines' press release stated.

In 2007 President Bush visited the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority. The Tennessee Valley Authority, which supplies power to almost 9 million Americans, \"has not fully implemented appropriate security practices to protect the control systems used to operate its critical infrastructures,\" leaving them \"vulnerable to disruption,\" the Government Accountability Office found. Simply put, that means a skilled hacker could disrupt the system and cause a blackout. Rep. James Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat, fears the problem is much larger than just the TVA. \"If they are not secure, I don't have a great deal of confidence that the rest of our critical infrastructure on the electric grid is secure,\" he said. The TVA operates 52 nuclear, hydroelectric and fossil-fuel facilities in the southeastern United States. Among the government watchdog agency findings: . \u2022 The TVA's firewalls have been bypassed or are inadequately configured . \u2022 Passwords are not effective . \u2022 Servers and work stations lack key patches and effective virus protection . \u2022 Intrusion-detection systems are not adequate . \u2022 Some locations lack enough physical security around control systems. The GAO recommends 73 steps to correct the problems in its report to Congress. In September, CNN first aired dramatic footage of a government experiment demonstrating that a cyber attack could destroy electrical equipment. The experiment, dubbed \"Aurora,\" caused a generator to fall apart and grind to a halt after a computer attack on its control system. The test was conducted by scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory. In October, the North American Electric Reliability Corp. told Congress that 75 percent of utilities had taken steps to mitigate the Aurora vulnerability, but Langevin said it now appears that Congress was misled. A congressional audit of the electric reliability corporation's claim cast doubt on the assertion that most utilities were taking steps to fix the problem. \"It appears that they just made those numbers up,\" Langevin said. \"It is not acceptable. It is outrageous.\" He said the result is there is now no clear picture of how vulnerable utilities are to cyber attacks. The electric reliability corporation -- a nongovernmental group that oversees the power system and comprises members of the industry and some consumers -- told CNN it regrets the confusion. Experts told CNN that Cooper Industries is the only manufacturer of hardware that can close the Aurora vulnerability. The company estimated it would need to sell about 10,000 devices to fix the problem nationwide. It has sold just over 100, it told CNN. Langevin said the federal government may need new powers to require utilities to take corrective actions to close cyber security gaps, and he will press to give those powers to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The congressman is chairing an Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology subcommittee hearing Wednesday afternoon. Representatives of the TVA, the GAO, the federal commission and the electric reliability corporation are to appear before the subcommittee.", "81e50c6cdbea4e55af6307d653135ef395b6d7fe": "(CNN) -- Meals Ready to Eat, or MREs are used by the military to provide nutritious and compact meals for the troops. The meals spark memories good and bad, for those who ate them in the military and even for some civilians who used them during disasters, when food was not readily available. Harald Schweizer was 19 when this photo was taken in the summer of 1968 in Vietnam. He is holding a C ration. CNN.com  readers shared their stories and memories of MREs and C rations. Some of the responses have been edited for clarity and length. Here is a selection: . Michael Reimers of Gresham, Oregon MREs are the fancy ones. We had C rations. Probably left over from WWII! For my 21st birthday in 1982 I was on border patrol at the Czech border and my friends snuck in two beers and made a cake for me out of what was available. They took a fruitcake that was in something like a tuna can tin and they mixed hot chocolate mix with grape jelly to make the frosting and added a candle and two German beers and we were in business out in the woods. It was very cool being with all my buddies and them doing that for me. Ronald Mervyn of Burton, Michigan I served in the army from April 1985 to February 1988. MREs were not all that bad. I liked the chicken ala king, the dehydrated potatoes patty and the chocolate chip cookies the best. They were all edible. I wish I could have brought some home to share with family and friends. Steven Carrigan of Salina, Kansas I served in the U.S. Marine corps. Did I eat MREs? You bet and a lot of them. They get the job done but always needed a bit of spicing up, Tabasco sauce that someone would bring to the field, usually. Cold weather affected them more than anything. Nothing worse than getting the beans and franks in cold weather. The beans would be semi-hard and the franks rock solid. The preservative that they are in gels up and looks like petroleum jelly. Had to carry them next to your body to get them warm. To me the worst one was the chicken ala king, disgusting. The desserts were always good. Some guys had recipes that you could mix together two or three MREs and have a pretty good meal if you had heat and the time to cook it. Even though I thought I left them behind when I left the military, I still have them in the car during the winter and when I do ice fishing. They are great in a pinch. Annette Sweet of Leavenworth, Kansas This is a different side of life all together; I believe the best memories were how to heat your MRE before they came out with the heating pouch. Spaghetti, wow that was a good one, the best way to serve it was to take your MRE cheese, a mini bottle of the Tabasco that came in the pack and mix it all together and place on the hood of your Humvee on a hot day or by the heater on a cold day. Umm good. Now, the worst ever that I believe they came out with was the loaf, I can't even say whether it was meat or vegetables but it really left a very heavy feeling in the pit of your stomach. You can never forget the ham slices; unfortunately they forgot to slice it, it was about \u00bd inch thick filled with gristle and very salty, very hard to digest. The different assortments of all the MREs were, as I call them, Charms candy, hard as a rock and stuck to your teeth; Tootsie roll, huge and didn't taste like chocolate; Chicklet gum, send you straight to the throne; the peanut butter and crackers, well, a bit oily but I considered a keeper. Oh, by the way, they did have real coffee. I believe it was Tasters Choice, not sure though. And fruit loaf, what can you say about a loaf? Once a loaf, always a loaf, and staying with tradition of blended items, you mixed a pack of the powered cream they gave you for the coffee in with just a smidgen of water and you had peaches ala mode. I never went hungry, but sometimes I never was full. I have retired now and have come to appreciate what is good food. It's being a civilian, sitting at a real table, with silverware, plate and glass, looking back on where I came from and knowing that I can't go back in body but in spirit. From a retired soldier, just keeping it real. To all my comrades that came before me, with me and after me, God Bless you and thank you for all that you do. Suzanne Yeltnuh of Ahwatukee, Arizona I was a victim of Hurricanes Jeanne, Frances and Wilma. We had no power for 21 days and the stores were out of food. I stood in lines for hours for ice and MREs and was very thankful. I actually think they are very good! Now that I moved to Arizona, at least I don't have to worry about hurricanes!Watch as civilians taste MREs . Clarence Ragland of Tucson, Arizona I not only had MREs, but I also had their predecessor, the C ration! C-rats, as they were called, came with a can opener called a P-38, and were OK. The MRE has come a long way since its inception, and the chicken ala king was one of the best. Still have some at home, although I retired from the Air Force in 2000. Megan Sterrett of APO, New York While I was in the Middle East in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, I sent an MRE to my children so they could see what they were like. My daughter, who was in the second grade, took it in to school for show and tell. One of the girls in the class declared that she would rather eat sand, to which my daughter replied, \"Well you can chose to eat this or choose to die.\" It's always interesting to get a child's perspective on things. You never know what they will come up with.Explore the history of U.S. combat rations . Gary Burton of Clarksville, Tennessee My father served in Vietnam and related this story to me about the old C rations they were served to eat. He said the canned sponge cake was an \"acquired taste,\" so instead of eating it, they opened a petcock valve on the nearby helicopters and filled the cake and tin with aircraft fuel. When lit, the sponge cake would burn for hours and allow the men to heat the rest of their meal with it. David Hollingsworth of Baltimore, Maryland I was a member of the 18th Airborne Corps F.A. b 5/8th Artillery in August 1990; among the first troops from Fort Bragg to deploy in that area. MREs were considered pretty OK meals to eat until my unit was linked in a special mission with the French troops. Their rations were of something that came off of our dinner tables. (Real food!) We would trade them every night for food until they realized what the big fuss was all about. I know real sardines and things of that nature might not sound as appetizing as other foods. However, compared to the MREs we were eating, the French troops' food was a delicacy to most. Mark Grocki of Birmingham, Michigan I have not served in the military, but I have eaten MREs on backpacking trips through Michigan provided to me by a friend's cousin who serves in the Marines. I've always looked forward to them, and have found the entrees like Mexican rice, beef stew, and ham and cheese omelets rather tasty. The crackers and various snack items are good on the go, too, but don't drink the water from the heating element! When asked by other people, \"What do they taste like?\" I have only one word for them. \"Freedom.\" E-mail to a friend .", "59fa6c3439d216272cc845d35627f8eb11b08a6d": "DERBY, England -- Substitute Emmanuel Adebayor struck his second hat-trick against Derby this season as Arsenal ran riot with a 6-2 Premier League victory at Pride Park. Arsenal players celebrate Robin Van Persie's goal in their comfortable 6-2 victory over Derby. The Gunners, 5-0 winners at The Emirates earlier in the season, made sure of third place in the table with a rousing second-half display against relegated Derby, who move closer to being the Premier League's worst-ever side. Arsene Wenger's side led 2-1 at the break after goals from Nicklas Bendtner and Robin van Persie either side of a Jay McEveley effort. Theo Walcott was on target too, but the second half belonged to Togo international striker Adebayor, who struck three times to take his season's tally to 30 in all competitions, with Rob Earnshaw grabbing a consolation for the hosts in this eight-goal thriller. Bottom side Derby, now 30 league games without a victory, began the more purposefully and Emanuel Villa only just failed to connect Tyrone Mears' inviting low cross . Then Mile Sterjovski's drive took a major deflection off Alex Song to wrong-foot goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, making his first league start for Arsenal, only for the ball to creep past the right-hand post. The Gunners struggled to find their rhythm early on and were fortunate not to go behind when Villa's bullet header flew just over. Derby were made to pay for those early misses when Darren Moore's 25th minute mistake presented the ball to Niklas Bendtner, who played a one-two with Robin Van Persie before coolly slotting the ball into the left corner. However, Derby soon scored the equalizer they deserved. Robbie Savage's inswinging free-kick landed on the six-yard line and Jay McEveley reacted first to hook the ball home. The home side's joy was short-lived though, when Derby's defensive frailties were exposed again as Van Persie as given all the time in the world to chest down Kolo Toure's floated pass and volley home in style. Adebayor replaced Van Persie for the second-half and Arsenal immediately looked intent on adding to their goals tally. Twice Kolo Toure, playing at right-back, fired over, the second opportunity created by Cesc Fabregas' brilliant backheel. There was nothing goalkeeper Roy Carroll could do to deny Adebayor Arsenal's third goal. Walcott took advantage of  Alan Stubbs' slip to cut the ball back to Emmanuel Eboue, who gave Adebayor an easy finish. Walcott should have made it four when he was put through by Bendtner but the teenager fired wide with the goal at his mercy. By now it was looking all too easy for the Gunners as they toyed with home side, creating chances at will -- but against the run of play Derby reduced the deficit to just a single goal when substitute Robert Earnshaw stroked the ball home. Yet within a minute the two-goal cushion was restored, Gael Clichy pinging a pinpoint pass to Walcott wide on the left before the youngster cut inside and curled into the top-right corner. Adebayor grabbed another poacher's goal, sliding to convert another Clichy assist with 10 minutes remaining before he wrapped up his hat-trick from an acute angle in added time. With two games remaining, Arsenal are four points behind Manchester United and Chelsea, still with an outside chance of lifting the Premier League title.

Scientists say the size of the threatened shelf is about 5,282 square miles. \"We are in for a lot more events like this,\" said professor Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Scambos alerted the British Antarctic Survey after he noticed part of the Wilkins ice shelf disintegrating on February 28, when he was looking at NASA satellite images. Late February marks the end of summer at the South Pole and is the time when such events are most likely, he said.  Watch aerial footage of the area \u00bb . \"The amazing thing was, we saw it within hours of it beginning, in between the morning and the afternoon pictures of that day,\" Scambos said of the large chunk that broke away on February 28. The Wilkins ice shelf lost about 6 percent of its surface a decade ago, the British Antarctic Survey said in a statement on its Web site . Another 220 square miles -- including the chunk that Scambos spotted -- had splintered from the ice shelf as of March 8, the group said. \"As of mid-March, only a narrow strip of shelf ice was protecting several thousand kilometers of potential further breakup,\" the group said. Scambos' center put the size of the threatened shelf at about 5,282 square miles, comparable to the state of Connecticut, or about half the area of Scotland.  See a map and photos as the collapse progressed \u00bb . Once Scambos called the British Antarctic Survey, the group sent an aircraft on a reconnaissance mission to examine the extent of the breakout. \"We flew along the main crack and observed the sheer scale of movement from the breakage,\" said Jim Elliott, according to the group's Web site. \"Big hefty chunks of ice, the size of small houses, look as though they've been thrown around like rubble -- it's like an explosion,\" he said. \"Wilkins is the largest ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula yet to be threatened,\" David Vaughan of the British Antarctic Survey said, according to the Web site. \"I didn't expect to see things happen this quickly. The ice shelf is hanging by a thread -- we'll know in the next few days or weeks what its fate will be.\" But with Antarctica's summer ending, Scambos said the \"unusual show is over for this season.\" Ice shelves are floating ice sheets attached to the coast. Because they are already floating, their collapse does not have any effect on sea levels, according to the Cambridge-based British Antarctic Survey. Scambos said the ice shelf is not currently on the path of the increasingly popular tourist ships that travel from South America to Antarctica. But some plants and animals may have to adapt to the collapse. \"Wildlife will be impacted, but they are pretty adept at dealing with a topsy-turvy world,\" he said. \"The ecosystem is pretty resilient.\" Several ice shelves -- Prince Gustav Channel, Larsen Inlet, Larsen A, Larsen B, Wordie, Muller and Jones -- have collapsed in the past three decades, the British Antarctic Survey said. Larsen B, a 1,254-square-mile ice shelf, comparable in size to the U.S. state of Rhode Island, collapsed in 2002, the group said. Scientists say the western Antarctic peninsula -- the piece of the continent that stretches toward South America -- has warmed more than any other place on Earth over the past 50 years, rising by 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit each decade. Scambos said the poles will be the leading edge of what's happening in the rest of the world as global warming continues. \"Even though they seem far away, changes in the polar regions could have an impact on both hemispheres, with sea level rise and changes in climate patterns,\" he said. News of the Wilkins ice shelf's impending breakup came less than two weeks after the United Nations Environment Program reported that the world's glaciers are melting away and that they show \"record\" losses. \"Data from close to 30 reference glaciers in nine mountain ranges indicate that between the years 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 the average rate of melting and thinning more than doubled,\" the UNEP said March 16. The most severe glacial shrinking occurred in Europe, with Norway's Breidalblikkbrea glacier, UNEP said. That glacier thinned by about 10 feet in 2006, compared with less than a foot the year before, it said. E-mail to a friend .

Judy Kay Zagorski, 55, of Pigeon, Michigan, died Thursday of \"blunt force craniocerebral trauma\" after the ray hit her when she was in a boat, Monroe County medical examiner Michael Hunter determined. He gave no indication in the preliminary report whether  the blow from the ray itself or her head hitting the deck, or both, killed her. \"It's just as freakish of an accident as I have heard,\" said Jorge Pino of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. \"The chances of this occurring are so remote that most of us are completely astonished that this happened.\" Zagorski was on the boat with her father and other family members and friends. She was seated or standing in the front of the vessel as it was traveling about 25 mph out of a channel, Pino said. \"The ray just actually popped up in front of the vessel,\" he said. \"The father had not even a second to react.

Ecstasy: Safina releases her emotions after her comeback win over Maria Sharapova in the French Open last 16. Bidding for the only Grand Slam title she has yet to win, new world No. 1 Sharapova twice blew big leads in the second set. Sharapova's customary screeches reached maximum volume as the match slipped away, and the noise seemed to annoy fans. They whistled and booed Sharapova as she left Court Suzanne Lenglen after the match, and she didn't acknowledge the crowd. \"I can't please everyone. It's not in my job description,\" she said. \"I'm an athlete, and I go out there and fight my heart out. They paid the ticket to watch me, so they must appreciate me on some level, right?\" Sharapova won five consecutive games in the second set to go ahead 5-2, and held a match point serving in the next game. She also led 5-2 in the second tiebreaker before losing five consecutive points, then unraveled down the stretch, losing the final four games and 10 of the last 12 points. It was the latest setback for Sharapova on clay, her least-favorite surface. \"On this stuff, things happen in a hurry,\" she said. \"It was all in her hands,\" Safina said. \"Then suddenly it changed.\" Safina, the younger sister of two-time Grand Slam champion Marat Safin, duplicated her upset of Sharapova in the fourth round at Roland Garros in 2006. She received a congratulatory text from her brother and said she hopes to join him as the winner of a major title. \"A dream of all our family,\" she said. \"Once we do this, we can put the racket on the wall and say we did everything we could. But to get to his level, I still have to work a little bit harder.\" The No. 13-seeded Safina's next opponent will be No. 7 Elena Dementieva, who won another all-Russian matchup against No. 11 Vera Zvonareva, 6-4 1-6 6-2. Trailing Sharapova 5-3 in the second set, Safina saved match point with a backhand winner, then broke two points later when Sharapova pushed a forehand wide. In the second tiebreaker, Sharapova double-faulted for 5-4 and then hit three errant backhands. That evened the match, but the momentum favored Safina.

Just two years ago, villagers had never seen light after dark, unless it came from the moon. Then, solar light arrived and changed everything. Children in Gudda stand on rooftops near a solar panel. Solar power first arrived two years ago. \"When the lanterns first arrived, the villagers asked, 'What is this?' \" says Hanuman Ram, the local solar engineer. \"I explained to them how it worked. Then slowly, as people saw it, they said, 'Wow, what a thing this is!' \" There are no real roads that lead to the tiny village in the state of Rajasthan in northwestern India, home to about 100 families. There are only thin strips of tar dotted with massive potholes that force vehicles into thick brush. Other times, cars have to maneuver over just dirt. There is no electricity -- power lines don't extend out here. Water is scarce, too. At the village well, women balance jugs of water on their heads, deftly evading the livestock that saunters along.  Visit the sites of Gudda with CNN's Arwa Damon \u00bb . It's a simple lifestyle of farming, tending to goats, caring for children and carrying out household chores -- a daily routine that hasn't changed much over the centuries. That's why light transformed Gudda. Villagers could play music at night. Children could study well past sundown.  Watch villagers smile as they light their solar lamps \u00bb .

The light is powered by a solar panel on her roof that charges a battery. Panels can be seen on almost every rooftop in Gudda.  See where Gudda is located \u00bb . Ram, the man credited with the transformation, doesn't have a high school degree. But he did attend an institution about an hour away called Barefoot College, established 35 years ago with an emphasis on helping India's rural population find solutions for their problems among themselves. The college, in part funded by the Indian government, trains villagers all over India who have little or no education, giving them a range of skills to change their lives. The entire campus, which has amenities such as a library, meeting halls, open-air theater and labs, uses solar power. On a recent visit to the main college campus, a group of village women were hard at work making solar cookers, which can boil a liter of water in eight minutes. They are part of the \"Women Barefoot Solar Cooker Engineers Society\" -- six women who came together and started their own business. Barefoot College serves an outlying community of 125,000 people. In a nearby village, women flock to a water desalinization and purification plant set up by the college and maintained by Barefoot graduates. The station, powered by solar panels, provides the area with a rare commodity: clean drinking water. At the local store in Gudda, owner Ram Swarup puts his solar panels to maximum use. He says the solar lights have allowed him to increase his business by a third. The panels also have powered up the only DVD player and television in the village. Partly paralyzed by polio, Swarup never dreamed that he would have so much in life. He says it took courage -- and light. The villagers say that they now feel empowered -- less reliant on a far-off government. Even the village's engineer is amazed. At Ram's house, the solar lamps flicker to life. He smiles as he says that before, he didn't even know what artificial light was, and now, he's a solar power expert. \"I never saw light before,\" he says. \"How could I think that I could bring light here?\" Like most of the Barefoot graduates, he was selected to attend the college by his village elders. Now, every night when the lights flicker on, he says, he feels great. With the extra earnings he's made as a solar engineer, he's made another of his childhood dreams come true. He purchased his favorite instrument, a harmonium, and now the family can gather around every night and listen to his music.

Tom Cruise appears with his wife, Katie Holmes, at a movie premiere earlier this month. \"I think it's a privilege to call yourself a Scientologist, and it's something you have to earn,\" Cruise says at the beginning of the video. Cruise says he's \"driven ... by the opportunity to really help, for the first time, change people's lives. I'm absolutely, uncompromisingly dedicated to that.\" The video was shown at a 2004 Scientology ceremony honoring Cruise for his humanitarian work. Church of Scientology officials said it can be viewed at any of its churches, but it created a stir this week when what the church calls a pirated and edited version appeared on YouTube. The video has since been taken off YouTube, but an interview portion remained available on the celebrity Web site gawker.com on Thursday.  Watch snippets of Cruise video \u00bb . \"The Cruise Indoctrination Video Scientology Tried To Suppress\" is the title of gawker.com's presentation. \"You have to watch this video,\" the site says. \"It shows Tom Cruise, with all the wide-eyed fervor that he brings to the promotion of a movie, making the argument for Scientology,\" which it calls \"the bizarre 20th-century religion.

A second part of the video, made available to CNN by the publisher of a new unauthorized biography of Cruise, shows Cruise accepting Scientology's Freedom Medal of Valor award and exchanging military-like salutes with Scientology chairman David Miscavige to audience applause. The publisher denies leaking other parts of the video to the Web. In the video by the publisher, Cruise also salutes a portrait of L. Ron Hubbard, cited on the church's Web site as the founder of \"the only major religion founded in the 20th century.\" Hubbard's biography cites his accomplishments as everything from mariner and horticulturalist to author and humanitarian. In the video, Cruise puts emphasis on the latter role. A Scientologist \"has the ability to create new realities and improve conditions,\" Cruise says. On its Web site, the Church of Scientology highlights its humanitarian work, from anti-drug campaigns in places from Minnesota to Taiwan to teacher training in India. The Web site defines Scientology as \"the study of truth.\" Cruise embraces that in the video. \"If you're a Scientologist, ... you see things the way they are,\" Cruise says. He also says he finds peace in the religion. \"The more you know as a Scientologist, you don't become overwhelmed by it,\" according to Cruise. The unauthorized biography of Cruise is by author Andrew Morton. A Cruise spokesperson and the Church of Scientology have disputed the book, saying Morton did not seek their comment. \"Accuracy and truth were not on Morton's agenda,\" according to a church statement. Morton denies that and says Cruise, who he calls \"a towering figure on the international scene,\" and his faith are worthy of scrutiny. \"Tom Cruise has done remarkable work for his faith over the past few years,\" Morton said. \"If it wasn't for him the Church of Scientology would be a shadow of what it is today.\" E-mail to a friend .

Joran van der Sloot awaits transfer from the Netherlands to Aruba in November. He later was released. In the video that aired Sunday on Dutch television, van der Sloot, a suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Holloway, told a man he was with the Alabama teen on an Aruban beach when she apparently died and that a friend of his with a boat disposed of Holloway's body. \"He went out to sea and then he threw her out, like an old rag,\" van der Sloot told Aruban businessman Patrick van der Eem January 16. Van der Eem recorded their conversations on hidden cameras installed in the Range Rover he was driving, according to the Dutch TV report.  Watch van der Sloot on hidden camera \u00bb . On the tapes, van der Sloot also says that he wasn't certain Holloway was dead before his friend dumped her body in the ocean. \"No, but it didn't look good,\" he said, when van der Eem asked him if he checked her pulse or other vital signs. \"I wasn't [expletive] sure, but from the time it happened to the time he came, she wasn't doing anything any more.\" Aruba's chief prosecutor, Hans Mos, called the account that aired \"very impressive\" and announced he was reopening the investigation. Van der Sloot later said the statements were lies, and on Monday his attorney said the video contains \"no admission of a crime.\" In the video, van der Sloot says Holloway and her friends begged him to go out with them the night of May 29, 2005. The Dutch student said he and two friends -- brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe -- met the women at a bar in Oranjestad. When they arrived, he said, the women appeared to have been drinking heavily and some were using cocaine. Holloway was in Aruba with about 100 classmates celebrating their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama. After declining an invitation from Holloway to dance on stage with her, he agreed to drink a shot of liquor from her navel as she lay on the bar, he said. About 1 a.m. May 30, he said, she left the bar with him and the Kalpoes, telling her friends she would meet them at their hotel before their planned return flight the next day to the United States, he said. The three men previously told authorities they then drove to the beach with Holloway, leaving her there when she told them she wanted to stay. But van der Sloot gave a different account in the hidden-camera footage. He said he wanted to have sex with Holloway, but she told him she did not want to go to her hotel. Instead, she said, she wanted to see sharks, he told the informant. The two brothers then used their car to drive van der Sloot and Holloway to the beach by the hotel and left them, van der Sloot said. He and Holloway then had sex, he said. But as they were caressing each other, she started shaking, then said nothing, he said. \"All of a sudden, what she did was like in a movie,\" he said. \"She was shaking, it was awful. ... I prodded her, there was nothing.\" He said he panicked and, when she did not appear to be alive, shook her but was unable to resuscitate her. He said he carried her body to a stand of trees, walked to a pay phone near the pool of the hotel and, instead of using his cell phone, called a friend who owned a boat that was tied up at a nearby dock. Upon the friend's arrival, the two men carried Holloway's body to the boat, and the friend told van der Sloot to go home, he said. The student then walked back to his house, where his father was asleep when he arrived about 15 minutes later, he recounted. He estimated the time at 2:30 or 3 a.m. Van der Sloot said the boat owner showed up at his house later in the morning and told him he had taken the body out less than a mile from land and dumped it overboard. He added that the incident with the woman has not bothered him. \"I didn't lose a minute of sleep over it,\" he said. The video footage shows van der Sloot is \"not innocent,\" Holloway's mother said Monday. \"Once people see the video, there are no more questions; there is no one that could walk away from this believing that he is innocent,\" Beth Twitty told ABC. Twitty described the video as a source of \"comfort,\" saying \"it means everything.\" \"I felt that it put an end to my nightmare,\" she said. \"The nightmare is not knowing, and I feel as if now, I can begin the mourning and the healing process for losing a child.\" She added, \"Not knowing is the absolute cruelest thing that a person can endure.\" Van der Sloot's attorney, Joe Tacopina, told ABC Monday that \"there's no confession, there's no admission of a crime by Joran on any of these tapes.\" He said much of what was in the video is \"easily disprovable based on corroborative evidence. ... The fact of the matter is he still is not responsible. The evidence, not Joran, the evidence, says he's not responsible for Natalee's death.\" Tacopina added, \"I'm certainly not asking at this point for anyone to believe Joran. ... Clearly his credibility is zero.\" Last week, van der Sloot called the Dutch television program \"Pauw & Witteman\" and acknowledged having made the comments but said they were lies. \"That is what he wanted to hear, so I told him what he wanted to hear,\" van der Sloot said. A judge denied a prosecution request that van der Sloot, the son of a lawyer, be detained in the Netherlands, where he is a student. The judge did determine that sufficient reason exists to reopen the inquiry against van der Sloot.  Watch CNN's Frederik Pleitgen report on the new video \u00bb . Mos said that on Tuesday he will appeal the judge's decision barring Van der Sloot's arrest and said that a three-judge panel will have eight days to rule on it.

Watch a CNN legal analyst discuss the Holloway case \u00bb . On Monday, Tacopina said at least two points of his client's story could be disproved. He said the Aruban coast guard had checked the pay phone where van der Sloot said he had called his friend, and the records show that \"there's no such call.\" Also, Tacopina said, the friend whom his client names in the video met van der Sloot two months ago, and the friend wasn't in Aruba in May 2005. He also has never owned a boat, the attorney said. Van der Eem told ABC he befriended van der Sloot by pretending to be a gangster after meeting him in a casino. \"Why did I want this? It's obvious. Everybody was looking for the truth. For her mother,\" he said. In the interview with ABC, van der Eem became emotional himself while saying that van der Sloot talked about Holloway's death \"without any emotions.\" Van der Eem, who ABC reported once spent a year in prison on drug charges, said he and van der Sloot smoked marijuana on long car rides over the course of several months. Van der Eem told the network he pretended to invite van der Sloot into a drug operation to gain his trust. He approached reporter Peter R. de Vries' television show, telling them he had gained van der Sloot's trust, and the program outfitted an SUV with hidden video cameras.

Student Hadeel Abukwaik, 23, says she hopes to have an exit visa to leave Gaza for the U.S. by August. In e-mails to the students on Sunday, the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem said the United States was working with Israeli authorities to let them leave the Hamas-ruled zone to study at American universities. The scholarships were reinstated after Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressed outrage about the initial decision, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said Monday. McCormack said the initial decision was partly the result of a \"faulty decision-making process\" by the State Department. \"The secretary saw it when it got to her level. She said, 'Fix it,'\" McCormack said. \"We hope that it has been fixed and that we are working with the Israelis to get these exit permits so that these individuals, again, can have a visa interview.\"  Watch how the students learned about the scholarship loss \u00bb . U.S. officials had said the scholarships were rescinded because Israel had denied them exit visas. But McCormack said Monday that U.S. authorities did not take up the matter with Israel until after the matter became public. Israel, which has been criticized for banning hundreds of students from leaving Gaza to study abroad, said it considers each application individually. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev indicated Sunday that his country would be willing to grant the students visas. \"This can happen,\" Regev said. \"No one has to pressure Israel on this issue. We have an interest. A real interest.\" Citing security concerns, Israel imposed an embargo on the movement of people and goods from Gaza after Islamic militant group Hamas took over the territory last year. Palestinians can leave Gaza only with Israeli permission. Hamas has refused to recognize Israel's right to exist, and Israel, the United States and the European Union have designated it a terrorist organization. McCormack said the seven Gaza Fulbright students must be interviewed by Israeli authorities before they can get visas to the United States. \"Should they have a successful visa interview -- and by law I can't prejudge an outcome of a visa interview -- then they would be able to come to the United States and pursue their program,\" he said. If the seven are allowed to leave, it would be the first time Israel has let students do so from Gaza since January, according to Palestinian advocacy group Gisha. One of the Gaza Fulbright scholars, Hadeel Abukwaik, 23, said she \"laughed like crazy\" from sheer joy when she received Sunday's e-mail. \"I was really hoping for this, but I didn't want to want it too much,\" the software engineering student said by phone Monday. \"I didn't want to be disappointed again. \"This is really good news.\" Fulbright scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic merit and leadership potential under the U.S. government-funded Fulbright program, which was started in 1946. The scholarships allow U.S. citizens and foreign nationals to study and teach abroad to promote the \"mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries of the world.\" More than 279,000 participants have been chosen for Fulbright scholarships. Abukwaik said the e-mail she received Sunday gave no indication about when the students might be able to travel. She is waiting to hear back from several universities, including ones in California and Florida. She said academic programs start in August and she hopes to have a visa to leave Gaza by then.

He has said he wants a genuine autonomy that preserves the cultural heritage of Tibet. Beijing blames the Dalai Lama and his followers for violence that erupted March 14 amid anti-Chinese demonstrations in Tibet. Some protesters advocated independence from China while others demonstrated against the growing influence of ethnic Han Chinese in Tibet and other regions of China with ethnic Tibetan populations.

The ancient Persian gold cup, thought to date from the third or fourth century B.C., fetched $100,000 at auction. The 5\u00bd-inch gold cup, which experts have dated to the third or fourth century B.C., fetched $100,000 at an auction in Dorchester, southern England, Thursday. The identity of the winning bidder wasn't immediately known. The relic features the double faced ancient Roman god Janus, the god of gates and doors who always looked to both the future and past and is often associated with beginnings and endings. The cup has two faces with braided hair and entwined snake ornaments at the forehead. Webber's grandfather, William Sparks, was a rag and bone man, the British term for a junk dealer, Duke's said, who established the iron merchants Sparks and Son in Taunton, Somerset, in southwestern England, in the 1930s. Sparks acquired the cup along with two other pieces, also up for auction, in the 1930s or 1940s, the spokeswoman said.  Watch CNN report on the auction \u00bb . Before he died, Sparks gave the items to Webber, who didn't realize their value, the spokeswoman said. \"Because he mainly dealt in brass and bronze, I thought that was what it was made from,\" Webber told the Bournemouth News and Picture Service. \"I put it in a box and forgot about it. Then last year I moved house and took it out to have a look, and I realized it wasn't bronze or brass. \"I sent it to the British Museum, and the experts there hadn't seen anything like it before and recommended I had it tested at a laboratory. So I paid quite a bit of money for it to be examined by a lab the museum recommended. And they found the gold dated from the third of fourth century B.C.\" Webber, who is in his 70s, said he remembers the cup from when he was a small boy. \"It's been quite exciting finding out what it was,\" he told the agency. Webber brought the items to Duke's at the start of the year for potential sale, because he wanted to \"realize some money,\" the auction house spokeswoman said. A spokeswoman for Duke's Auction House, which is selling the cup, said the cup is believed to be from the Archaemenid empire in ancient Persia.

Hello Kitty, the moon-faced cat with a bow in her hair and no mouth. Shintaro Tsuji, CEO of Sanrio, famous for its Hello Kitty brand, speaks in The Boardroom. She's one of 450 characters developed by Japan's Sanrio Group, but she's by far most popular -- the embodiment of what's known in Japan as Kawaii, or the culture of cute. Her image adorns some 50,000 objects, from cute, of course, to downright crazy. But there's nothing cute about the numbers. Hello Kitty is responsible for more than half of Sanrio's billion dollar annual turnover. Her creator and founder of Sanrio is the effervescent 79-year-old Shintaro Tsuji. He told The Boardroom's Andrew Stevens what he thinks is the marketing secret behind a cultural icon. Tsuji: Selling something which people want to buy is one of the ways of doing business. But I thought, goods that I want are also something other people want. So we wanted to make goods which people want to send to somebody else as a gift. The idea is that goods are for social communication purposes and that has been accepted worldwide. In addition, to give Hello Kitty goods as a present is very thoughtful. Our three concepts of friendship, cuteness and thoughtfulness have been reaching out to people. It conveys the importance of being friendly. Such gestures are necessary for the Japanese nation. You care about other people by sending some gifts. Those concepts have been accepted worldwide. Stevens: My first question to you is Sanrio has developed something like 450 characters. Why it is Hello Kitty has stood out so much more than the others? What is the secret of its success? Tsuji: At first we were using characters which were created by outsiders, such as cartoonists or artists, but in this case we had to pay the royalty. So we decided to create our own characters. We hired many artists and asked them to create various characters. According to our own research, the most popular animal character was a dog then a white cat and the third one was a bear. Snoopy already existed as a dog character -- that's why we went for the second most popular character. We asked the artists to design a character based on a white cat. Stevens: Let me just ask you a question about your life, growing up. Reading your autobiography, you lost your mother when you were 13 years old. You went to live with your auntie. And you describe your life; your childhood, has been a quite lonely. How do you think that has shaped you in your business life? Tsuji: I felt that the most important thing in your life is to have someone whom you can open up your heart to and talk about anything; to have many friends whom you can talk with your heart is the most blessed thing in your life. Then I asked myself how can you make friends -- in what way people can make a friend with those people. That is not just to avoid behaving, which makes people uncomfortable. But do something, which makes people happy. In this way people can make friends. For example, when people are ill, you can say something to them, or when people did something for you, you say thank you to them. For those kinds of occasions, you send a small present rather than an expensive gift. It is important to show your appreciation since you are able to make good friends in this way. This idea has formed as a business. As a result, Hello Kitty was created. Hello Kitty has become known among everybody and it means that people are becoming friends. I am pleased with this phenomenon. Stevens: What, in your business career, is the most important lesson you think you've learnt? Tsuji: A good company means that, first of all, its sale increases each year and secondly it makes profits each year. This is what people call a quality company. But this is not my main concern. Obviously, a company shouldn't lose money. A company cannot contribute to a society easily. But for me, it is important to establish a company, which has a good reputation. Stevens: Much easier said than done, how do you remain true to your original ideas, though, because there are so many pressures from shareholders among other people to make those profits? Tsuji: The company shareholders actually say \"Make more profits or dividends.\" But what I always say to them at the general assembly is that the shareholder should be someone who truly values my company and is proud of having my company's share. According to newspapers, there are companies which make a profit by polluting the environment or breaking laws. But this is not acceptable by our standard. I bet the company staffs want to have an increase in the wages. But I want my staffs to be proud of themselves, in particular, when their children ask them where they are working. In my view, that is very important. Stevens: What advice would you give to someone starting out their own company in 21st century? Tsuji: It is not only about making profits or establishing a huge corporation. A bigger country doesn't mean a better country. Having a larger military capacity doesn't mean a better thing. It will be ideal to establish a company which is a value to the world. It's not just about the money. So I would say \"How about creating companies which people appreciate?\" E-mail to a friend .", "60fc2801c429858cc0a87e547f1c30e34a7a96f3": "(CNN) -- U.S. President George Bush railed against the government of Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe Monday, calling intimidation of opposition figures \"deplorable.\" Leading opposition figure Artur Mutambara was arrested following his criticism of President Robert Mugabe. \"The continued use of government-sponsored violence in Zimbabwe, including unwarranted arrests and intimidation of opposition figures, to prevent the Movement for Democratic Change from campaigning freely ahead of the June 27 presidential runoff election is deplorable,\" Bush said in a statement released by the U.S. Embassy in neighboring South Africa.

Police in Harare surrounded the house of student activist-turned-opposition politician Arthur Mutambara and arrested him on charges of contempt of court and publishing falsehoods, MDC official Romualdo Mavedzenge said. While Zimbabwe authorities have arrested dozens of MDC supporters and activists over the past two months, Mavedzenge said \"this is the highest profile MDC official (arrested) since the March 29 election.\" Mutambara is president of an MDC faction that split from the main party headed by Morgan Tsvangirai. After Tsvangirai's party won the majority of seats in parliament, the two leaders agreed to join forces in parliament under Mutambara's leadership. Both charges stem from an opinion piece written by Mutambara in which he criticized President Robert Mugabe for the way the March 29 elections were handled. Raphael Khumalo, chief executive of The Sunday Standard, which published the article, was arrested last month on charges of publishing falsehoods. Bush said Mugabe's government is failing on multiple levels. \"We call on the regime to immediately halt all attacks and to permit freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and access to the media,\" Bush said. \"We urge the Southern African Development Community, the African Union, the United Nations, and other international organizations to blanket the country with election and human rights monitors immediately.\" Zimbabwe's election commission said Tsvangirai won the March presidential election, but didn't win a majority of the vote, forcing this month's vote. The MDC contested the results, saying Tsvangirai won outright, but decided to take part in the runoff and not cede the election to Mugabe.", "d885b755dab03a11c7e3b19455b82859a6e1f76b": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- A massive blast targeting the Danish Embassy in Pakistan Monday killed at least six people and wounded as many as 18, authorities said. The scene of devastation in Islamabad Monday after a suicide car bomb attack near the Danish Embassy. The blast left a four-foot deep crater in the road. Confusion lingered about the attack in the capital city of Islamabad and the number of casualties. Police at the scene said a suicide car bomber pulled up next to the embassy at about 1 p.m. and detonated explosives. But Senior Superintendent of Police Ahmad Latif told CNN that authorities could not immediately label it a suicide attack. Likewise, a medical worker told CNN the explosion killed eight people, including a young child and at least one foreign national. But Latif put the number of fatalities at six and said none of the dead were foreigners. Among the wounded, he said, was a Brazilian citizen of Pakistani descent.  Watch Pakistan's foreign minister respond \u00bb . Authorities differed on the number of wounded as well, with figures ranging from five to 18. No embassy official was seriously hurt, Latif said. It is not uncommon for preliminary casualty figures to vary: police cautioned that the numbers could rise. Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller condemned the act. \"My immediate reaction is that you can only condemn this,\" said Stig Moeller. \"It is terrible that terrorists do this. The embassy is there to have a cooperation between the Pakistani population and Denmark, and that means they are destroying that. They're destroying the Pakistanis' ability to connect with Denmark. It is completely unacceptable.\"  Watch the aftermath of the deadly attack \u00bb . The blast, heard more than two miles away, sheared off the embassy's front wall and kicked in its metal front gate. The impact blew out the building's windows and also damaged the offices of a non-profit organization. The Danish and the EU flag, knocked off their staff, hung limply from a spot on the embassy balcony. Pakistan Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir told reporters at the scene that police are beefing up security at embassies and foreign missions throughout the city. \"I just want to assure everybody that the government will do everything to protect the diplomatic missions and also the security and safety of the citizens of Pakistan,\" he said. The explosion was the first deadly attack in Islamabad since a bomb was hurled over a wall surrounding an Italian restaurant on March 15. That explosion killed a Turkish woman and wounded 12 people, including four U.S. FBI agents. After Monday's attack, dozens of cars -- blanketed with dirt kicked up by the blast -- littered the street, their windows knocked out. Rescue workers carried away a bloodied person, covering his body with a blanket. Pieces of shoes and tattered clothing lay amid the rubble. Police said the attack targeted the embassy. Danish embassies in predominantly Muslim countries, such as Pakistan, have been the scene of protests since Danish newspapers reprinted cartoons that Muslims say insult their prophet. In February, several newspapers in Denmark reprinted the controversial cartoons of Islam's prophet, Muhammad, after Danish authorities arrested several people who allegedly were plotting a \"terror-related assassination\" of the cartoonist, Kurt Westergaard. Westergaard's cartoon depicted the prophet wearing a bomb as a turban with a lit fuse. He said he wanted his drawing to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terror. However, many in the Muslim world interpreted the drawing as depicting their prophet as a terrorist. Islam generally forbids any depiction of the prophet -- even favorable ones -- fearing that it may lead to idolatry. Two years ago, demonstrations erupted across the world after some newspapers printed the same cartoons. Some protests turned deadly. The protests prompted Danish officials to temporarily close the embassy in Islamabad. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for Monday's blast. In the past, authorities have blamed Islamic militants for carrying out attacks inside Pakistani cities. The country experienced a month-long lull in attacks after a new government took office in March and set on a course to negotiate with militants. But since then, attacks have picked up again.

Edward Kennedy's brain was successful, and the Democrat should suffer no permanent damage from the procedure, his surgeon reported Monday. Sen. Edward Kennedy, right, leaves a Boston hospital with his son Patrick on May 21. The patient himself expressed satisfaction. \"I feel like a million bucks,\" Kennedy said after the surgery, according to a family spokesperson. \"I think I'll do that again tomorrow.\" Kennedy's doctor's statement focused on the 3\u00bd-hour operation, which was performed at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. \"I am pleased to report that Sen. Kennedy's surgery was successful and accomplished our goals,\" Dr. Allan Friedman said in a written statement issued after the procedure. \"Sen. Kennedy was awake during the resection, and should therefore experience no permanent neurological effects from the surgery.\" Friedman called the resection \"just the first step\" in Kennedy's treatment plan, which is to include radiation and chemotherapy, to be carried out at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Paging Dr. Gupta Blog: Mapping Ted Kennedy's brain . The 76-year-old Massachusetts senator, patriarch of one of the leading families of American politics, said in a written statement earlier that he expected to remain in the hospital for about a week after surgery. He is also expected to undergo radiation and chemotherapy. During such surgery, doctors locate the areas of the brain responsible for key attributes such as movement and speech, and map them to ensure they avoid cutting in those areas. They then attempt to resect as much of the tumor as they believe they can safely remove.  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta explain possible treatment \u00bb . During such operations -- which Friedman and the Duke hospital are known for -- surgeons typically ask a patient to identify objects in pictures or make a certain movement, such as squeezing a hand to make sure areas of the brain involving speech and movement are not being impaired. Kennedy, a senator since 1962, suffered a seizure May 17 while walking his dogs at his home in Hyannisport, Massachusetts. Three days later, Kennedy's doctors at Massachusetts General said preliminary results from a brain biopsy showed a tumor in the left parietal lobe was responsible for the seizure. Friedman is chief of the division of neurosurgery and co-director of Duke's Neuro-Oncology Program, according to the hospital's Web site. He is responsible for more than 90 percent of all tumor removals and biopsies conducted at Duke, the Web site says. A tumor in the left parietal lobe could affect the senator's ability to speak and understand speech as well as the strength on the right side of his body, said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Hear iReporter describes what gave him strength through brain cancer battle . Gupta said such tumors don't usually metastasize or spread to other parts of the body. \"What they do do -- and I think that's a concern to people -- is that they grow, and sometimes they invade other normal parts of the brain. That is the big concern here,\" he said. Malignant glioma is the most common primary brain tumor, accounting for more than half of the 18,000 primary malignant brain tumors diagnosed each year in the United States, according to the National Cancer Institute.  An expert explains potential complications \u00bb . Kennedy is the brother of President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in Dallas in 1963, and New York Sen. Robert Kennedy, who was assassinated while seeking the White House in 1968. Though his own attempt to seek the presidency failed, Edward Kennedy has built a reputation as one of the most effective lawmakers in the Senate. Kennedy's Monday statement focused on the current presidential race as well his surgery. \"After completing treatment, I look forward to returning to the United States Senate and to doing everything I can to help elect Barack Obama as our next president,\" he said. Obama, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, described Kennedy as a \"giant\" of the Senate when the tumor was diagnosed. \"I think you can argue that I would not be sitting here as a presidential candidate had it not been for some of the battles that Ted Kennedy has fought,\" Obama said. \"He is somebody who battled for voting rights and civil rights when I was a child. I stand on his shoulders.\" Obama's rival, Sen. Hillary Clinton, said Kennedy's courage and resolve made him one of the greatest legislators in Senate history. \"He's a fighter. There isn't anybody like him who gets up and goes out and does battle on behalf of all of us every single day,\" Clinton said. \"I know he's a fighter when it comes to the challenges he's facing right now.\" Sen. John McCain, the presumed GOP presidential nominee, also offered his thoughts and prayers for Kennedy's family. \"I have described Ted Kennedy as the last lion in the Senate. And I have held that view because he remains the single most effective member of the Senate,\" McCain said. President Bush said in a statement he would keep the senator in his prayers. \"Laura and I are concerned to learn of our friend Sen. Kennedy's diagnosis. Ted Kennedy is a man of tremendous courage, remarkable strength and powerful spirit. Our thoughts are with Sen. Kennedy and his family during this difficult period,\" he said. Kennedy had surgery in October to clear his carotid artery in hopes of preventing a stroke. Until the seizure, the powerful Democrat appeared in fine health. He suffers chronic back pain from injuries suffered in a 1964 plane crash.

William Fallon resigned in March as leader of the U.S. military's Central Command after reportedly clashing with President Bush. Retired Adm. William Fallon told CNN he resigned to maintain confidence in the military chain of command. During an interview Tuesday on CNN's American Morning,\" Fallon denied a magazine article's assertion that he had been forced to resign over his opposition to a possible war with Iran. CNN's Kyra Phillips asked Fallon about his resignation and about U.S. policy regarding Iraq and Iran. Kyra Phillips: How were you informed that this was it? Who called you? Fallon: The story is -- the facts are that the situation was one that was very uncomfortable for me and, I'm sure, for the president. One of the most important things in the military is confidence in the chain of command. And the situation that developed was one of uncertainty and a feeling that maybe that I was disloyal to the president and that I might be trying to countermand his orders, the policies of the country. ... The fact that people might be concerned that I was not appropriately doing what I was supposed to do and following orders bothered me, and my sense was that the right thing to do was to offer my resignation.  Watch Fallon break his silence \u00bb . Phillips: Do you feel you were pushed out? Fallon: What was important was not me. It wasn't some discussion about where I was with issues. It was the fact that we have a war in progress. We had a couple of hundred thousand people whose lives were at stake out in Iraq and Afghanistan and we needed to be focused on that and not a discussion on me or what I might have said or thought or someone perceived I said. That's the motivation. Phillips: [Esquire magazine writer] Tom Barnett made it appear that you were the only man standing between the president and a war with Iran. Is that true? Fallon: I don't believe for a second President Bush wants a war with Iran. The situation with Iran is very complex. People sometimes portray it or try to portray it in very simplistic terms -- we're against Iran, we want to go to war with Iran, we want to be close to them. ... The reality is in international politics that [there are] many aspects to many of these situations, and I believe in our relationship with Iran we need to be strong and firm and convey the principles on which this country stands and upon which our policies are based. At the same time demonstrate a willingness and openness to engage in dialogue because there are certainly things we can find in common. Phillips: Would have you negotiated with Iran? Fallon: It's not my position to negotiate with Iran. I was the military commander in the Middle East. I had responsibility for our people and their safety and well-being. It's the role of the diplomats to do the negotiation. Phillips: So when talk of the third war came out, a war with Iran, the president didn't say to you, \"This is what I want to do,\" and did you stand up and say, \"No, sir. Bad move\"? Fallon: It's probably not appropriate to try to characterize it in that way. Again, don't believe for a second that the president really wants to go to war with Iran. We have a lot of things going on, and there are many other ways to solve problems. I was very open and candid in my advice. I'm not shy. I will tell people, the leaders, what I think and offer my opinions on Iran and other things, and continue to do that. Phillips: Do you think that cost you your job? Fallon: No, I don't believe so at all. It's a confidence issue of do people really believe the chain of command is working for them or do we have doubts, and if the doubts focus attention away from what the priority issues ought to be, then we've got to make a change. Phillips: We talk about your no-nonsense talk and the fact that you had no problems standing up to the president. Your critics say that Admiral Fallon is a difficult man to get along with. Are you? Fallon: You probably could ask my wife about that. She would have a few things to say. I think that what's really important here is that when I was asked to take this job about a year and a half ago, I believe it was because we were facing some very difficult days in Iraq and Afghanistan and in the region. I had some experience in dealing with international problems. I certainly had a lot of combat experience, and I was brought in in an attempt to make things better. That's what I went about doing. Again, there are things that are important and other things in life that are less so. A lot of the issues that became points of discussion to me were not really important items. The important items were the people, what they're doing, how to get this job done, how to get the war ended and get our people home. Phillips: Hillary Clinton [and] Barack Obama talk about pulling troops out by next year. John McCain says, no, we've got to stay the course. What is the best course for Iraq right now?  Watch what the candidates say about war policy \u00bb . Fallon: I believe the best course is to retain the high confidence we have in General Dave Petraeus and his team out there. Dave has done a magnificent job in leading our people in that country. Again, this situation is quite complex -- many angles. There's a very, very important military role here in providing stability and security in this country, but that's not going to be successful, as we know, without lots of other people playing a hand. The political side of things in Iraq has got to move forward. That appears to be improving. People have to have confidence in their futures. They want to have stability. They would like to be able to raise their families in peace. They would like to have a job. They would like to look to tomorrow as better than today. It takes more than the military, but the military is essential to provide stability and security. The idea we would walk away from Iraq strikes me as not appropriate. We all want to bring our troops home. We want to have the majority of our people back and we want the war ended. Given where we are today, the progress that they've made particularly in the last couple months, I think it's very, very heartening to see what's really happened here. The right course of action is to continue to work with the Iraqis and let them take over the majority of the tasks for ensuring security for the country and have our people come out on a timetable that's appropriate to conditions on the ground.", "03a0cef9c902928979ef731616fb96bd1fb10f9f": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen.

White House press secretary Dana Perino said Wednesday that President Bush congratulated Obama on becoming the first black nominee from a major party.

Saying Clinton would \"entertain the idea if it's offered,\" Johnson said, \"This is Sen. Obama's decision.

U.S. ships steam in formation off the coast of Myanmar on May 23. Adm. Timothy Keating said the USS Essex group would leave the shores of Myanmar, also known as Burma, on Thursday, but that he would leave several heavy lift aircraft in Thailand to assist international relief efforts. \"We have made at least 15 attempts to convince the Burmese government to allow our ships, helicopters and landing craft to provide additional disaster relief for the people of Burma, but they have refused us each and every time,\" Keating said in a statement Wednesday. Cyclone Nargis made landfall early last month, killing more than 77,000 people in the southeastern Asian country, according to a United Nations estimate. Some 55,000 others are missing, the United Nations said, and as many as 500,000 to 600,000 people, mainly in the Irrawaddy Delta region, have had to be relocated.

Myanmar leaders did grant permission for U.S. planes to deliver aid, a total of 106 plane-loads of supplies worth more than $26 million. Transportation cost about $6.8 million, it said. But the junta never gave permission for the United States to distribute the aid directly to the storm victims, prompting questions about whether some of the assistance went astray. Last weekend, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon guided a conference of 52 donor nations in Myanmar, where countries pledged in excess of $100 million to help Myanmar recover -- and said they are willing to open up their wallets further once aid groups are granted access to the worst-affected areas. The country's government had asked for $11 billion in assistance, saying that the relief phase of the disaster was already over and that it needed the money for reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts. More than a month after the cyclone struck, more than 1 million people affected have received help, Elisabeth Byrs of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Tuesday.  She added that aid has reached nearly half of the people in the Irrawaddy Delta. However, she said, \"There remains a serious lack of sufficient and sustained humanitarian assistance.\" On Tuesday, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said that the United States would continue to push to get emergency supplies to the country's victims. \"We are not going to abandon those ... people,\" McCormack said. Of the Navy ships leaving the area, he said, they \"are needed elsewhere and there is no rational expectation at this point we will be effectively able to use those assets in an humanitarian relief operation.\" \"Our folks will do the forensics on that to see if there are any lessons learned,\" McCormack said. \"We think that to the extent that there has been significant loss of life that we as well as others could have reduced that number had we been allowed to act more quickly with a large-scale intervention.\" CNN's Charley Keyes and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.", "0d7383a44955b41c5a472151a35a842751f0004c": "SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- Hyundai Chairman Chung Mong-koo escaped a prison sentence for embezzlement after a South Korean court ruled Thursday to instead impose a suspended five year sentence, according to a company spokesman.

Webber's grandfather, William Sparks, was a rag and bone man, the British term for a junk dealer, Duke's said, who established the iron merchants Sparks and Son in Taunton, Somerset, in southwestern England, in the 1930s. Sparks acquired the cup along with two other pieces, also up for auction, in the 1930s or 1940s, the spokeswoman said.  Watch CNN report on the auction \u00bb . Before he died, Sparks gave the items to Webber, who didn't realize their value, the spokeswoman said. \"Because he mainly dealt in brass and bronze, I thought that was what it was made from,\" Webber told the Bournemouth News and Picture Service. \"I put it in a box and forgot about it. Then last year I moved house and took it out to have a look, and I realized it wasn't bronze or brass. \"I sent it to the British Museum, and the experts there hadn't seen anything like it before and recommended I had it tested at a laboratory. So I paid quite a bit of money for it to be examined by a lab the museum recommended. And they found the gold dated from the third of fourth century B.C.\" Webber, who is in his 70s, said he remembers the cup from when he was a small boy. \"It's been quite exciting finding out what it was,\" he told the agency. Webber brought the items to Duke's at the start of the year for potential sale, because he wanted to \"realize some money,\" the auction house spokeswoman said. A spokeswoman for Duke's Auction House, which is selling the cup, said the cup is believed to be from the Archaemenid empire in ancient Persia. The other two items are a second century B.C. round gold mount with a figure, probably of ancient Greek hero Ajax, who besieged Troy, and a decorated gold spoon with an image of a Roman emperor. \"He had a good eye for quality over the years,\" said the spokeswoman, who asked not to be named, \"and anything interesting he'd put aside.\" Scientists analyzed trace elements of a gold sample taken from the cup to determine its age, and analysts from Oxford University concluded that they are consistent with Archaemenid gold and goldsmithing, Duke's said.", "b4aa207f0723ae8a731dbc07ecdb03a68a42031f": "(CNN) -- A former member of the radical 1970s group Symbionese Liberation Army is back in custody after a clerical error miscalculated her prison release date, a California Department of Corrections spokesman said Saturday. Sara Jane Olson wipes away a tear at a Los Angeles courthouse in 1999. Sara Jane Olson was freed Monday. But her earliest release date is now March 17, 2009, Chief Deputy Secretary Scott Kernan said, calling the error \"an aberration.\" \"Our department immediately rearrested her, and she will serve her full sentence,\" Kernan said. He described Olson as cooperative and said the arrest took place \"without incident.\" She will serve the year at the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla, California. \"The department is sensitive to the impact such an error has had on all involved in this case and sincerely regrets the mistake,\" Kernan said.  Watch explanation for mistaken release \u00bb . An investigation is under way to find out how the error happened, he added. Olson had served about six years behind bars for her role in incidents in 1975: the attempted bombing of two police cars and the shooting death of a customer during a bank robbery. Prosecutors said she was part of an SLA plot to murder Los Angeles police officers by planting bombs under their squad cars. One of the cars was parked outside a crowded Hollywood restaurant. The bombs did not go off, and no one was hurt. The SLA is best known for its 1974 kidnapping of newspaper heiress Patty Hearst. A parole board hearing in 2004 reduced the sentence related to the attempted bombing charge, but \"an administrative error failed to take into account\" the second-degree murder charge for the shooting death, Kernan said. David Nickerson, one of Olson's attorneys, said he and co-counsel Shawn Chapman Holley intend to file a petition with Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday. Olson cannot be treated as \"yo-yo\" in regard to the law, he said. Chapman Holley called her return to custody \"ridiculous.\" \"It's like they make up all new rules when it comes to her,\" Chapman Holley told The Associated Press. \"It's like we are in some kind of fascist state.\" The administrative error was verified late Saturday morning, Kernan said, after a thorough review of Olson's case. He said \"concerns\" about her release date prompted the review. Olson was taken into custody at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday night, Kernan said. Olson had been granted interstate parole and was on her way to Minnesota, where she lived for more than two decades as a fugitive before she was arrested in 1999, Nickerson had said. From the Los Angeles airport, authorities took Olson to her home in Palmdale, California, where she remained until she was arrested midday Saturday, when the review was completed, Kernan said. Originally named Kathleen Soliah, Olson fled California after authorities began looking for her and then changed her name and lived for more than two decades as a fugitive before she was arrested in 1999 in Minnesota. She had married and was raising three daughters. Many residents rallied to Olson's cause and helped post bail for her. But one group in California, the Los Angeles Police Protective League, denounced her release. \"She needs to serve her full time in prison for these crimes and does not deserve time off for working in prison,\" the group said. \"After participating in one killing and attempting two more, she managed to elude authorities and live a guilt-free middle class life for decades. Criminals who attempt to murder police officers should not be able to escape justice simply because they have good lawyers.\"  E-mail to a friend .

His grandfather, Allen Parrish, was a Pullman Porter and helped inspire some of his train paintings. Robert West paints his latest project in his Atlanta, Georgia,  studio. \"When I was growing up, we would often take grandfather to work at the train station. I became impressed and mesmerized with trains through this experience. This passion ultimately led me to become a full-time railroad illustrator,\" West said. The Pullman Company was one of the largest employers of African-Americans in the 1920s and '30s. It hired them as porters in railroad sleeping cars to assist railroad passengers and make up beds. These jobs were once highly regarded in the black community because they offered the opportunity to travel and better pay and security than most jobs open to blacks at the time. West says trains have an important place in African-American history -- from symbolism in Negro spirituals to a real conveyance for the mass migration of blacks moving to the North in the 1930s, '40s and '50s. \"Trains have so long symbolized hope, freedom and power -- what better metaphor could there be to represent our struggle and our assimilation into mainstream American life,\" West said. Many of West's paintings depict historical scenes with the now defunct Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, because that's where his grandfather worked for many years.  Watch award-winning artist on trains and history \u00bb . West paints other trains, including the Steam, Gas turbine, Electric, as well as first through sixth Generation Diesel Electric Locomotives. He wears a conductor's hat as he works. \"I think it's important that all the cultures in the United States look back at our history by way of the railroads,\" West said. \"It was through our contributions to the railroads, that also pushed us forward as a nation and as a human race.\" West has been drawing and painting trains since the age of 2. In 1973, he decided to make railroad illustrating a profession. Through the years his work has won several awards in shows of national and regional scope. \"I'm probably more of a visual historian more than anything else, because I conduct weeks, months, sometimes years of research prior to doing a painting,\" he said. West has painted more than 500 original works, which have sold across the United States and around the world.

President Bush, with President Viktor Yushchenko, praised Ukraine's democratic and military reforms. \"The missile defense system is not aimed at Russia,\" Bush said at a news conference in Kiev following talks with the Ukrainian president. \"It's viewed as an anti-Russian device. Well, it's not.\" His comments came before he left Kiev for a NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania, that is expected to highlight divisions over the plan. The summit begins Wednesday. Russia and some European countries have expressed concerns about the missile defense system. While Poland and the Czech Republic have agreed to host parts of the system, others in Europe share Russian concerns that the defensive shield could be used for offensive aims. Outside the U.S. Embassy in Kiev on Monday, protesters gathered to denounce Bush's visit. They chanted, thrust signs into the air -- one reading, \"Yankee Go Home\" -- and burned an effigy of Bush in the street.  Watch the demonstration \u00bb . The U.S. has tried to dissuade opposition over the plan. Washington offered to allow Russian monitors at the missile sites and to negotiate limits to the system over time. The United States also told Russia the system would not be operational until Iran test-fires a missile that could threaten Europe. Many European countries don't believe the U.S. assertion that the system is needed to guard against imminent threats from Iran or North Korea. Europe is dependent on Russia for at least 40 percent of its oil and is reluctant to upset the Kremlin. The issue will likely be divisive at this week's three-day NATO summit, where Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to make a rare appearance. Putin normally declines invitations to attend. Bush is slated to meet Sunday with Putin in the Russian resort city of Sochi on the Black Sea, according to RIA Novosti. It will be the last meeting between the two men before the outgoing Russian president steps down, the Russian news agency reported. Russia also is unhappy with NATO's eastward march. The alliance has already welcomed former Soviet republics such as Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Bush is pushing hard for Georgia and Ukraine to join NATO as well. Before leaving Tuesday for Bucharest, Bush said that Russia will not be able to veto Georgia's or Ukraine's inclusion into NATO. Bush said that both countries should be able to take part in NATO's Membership Action Plan, or MAP, which is designed to help aspiring countries meet the requirements of joining the alliance. \"I strongly believe that Ukraine and Georgia should be given MAP,\" Bush said. \"And there's no tradeoffs, period.\" The U.S. president further said he was working \"as hard as I can\" to ensure the two countries are accepted into the MAP and that Russia will have no power to block their inclusion. In remarks last month, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer told the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe that NATO \"has long made clear that any decision regarding membership is between NATO and the country concerned, and not subject to veto by any third party.\" Russia is not a NATO member but works with the alliance via the NATO-Russia Council. Russia's concerns also align with those of some NATO members who oppose welcoming Georgia and Ukraine into the fold. Pifer said last month that NATO should strive to maintain good relations with Russia, but \"should not allow Moscow a veto, either explicit or tacit, over relations between the alliance and third countries.\" Allowing Russia a say, Pifer said, \"would encourage those in Russia who wish to reassert a Russian-led post-Soviet bloc rather than develop a relationship of cooperation and full partnership with Europe and the West.\" Bush said he phoned Putin recently to reassure him on both issues. \"NATO is an organization that's peaceful. NATO is an organization that helps democracies flourish. And democracies are good things to have on your border,\" Bush said he told Putin. Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko said his country should be able to start the NATO membership process. \"We are not speaking about joining NATO; we are only speaking about MAP,\" he said at the news conference. \"Why should Ukraine be deprived of that sovereign right, since the principle of open doors is the basic principle for NATO?\" Bush added that Ukraine already contributes to NATO missions, specifically in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo. Ukraine also has demonstrated a commitment to democracy, he said. Responding to a reporter's question, Bush denied that the United States might ease off on membership plans for Ukraine and Georgia if Russia acquiesces on the missile shield. Both issues threaten to destabilize NATO, said Jane Sharp of the Center for War Studies at King's College London, but she has heard particularly sharp criticism of the missile defense plan. \"Somebody in the UK Ministry of Defense said to me, 'We are being dragged along on this missile defense thing to the American trough like pigs with rings in our noses,'\" Sharp said. \"It's a nuisance for Europeans, and I think they are irritated with the Czechs and the Poles for trying to do deals with the Americans.\" E-mail to a friend .", "39074eb06df4966d1e06f76ad2f0713b31335fe5": "MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Spanish police Tuesday arrested two Moroccan men suspected of having links to Islamic terrorism, Spain's Ministry of Interior said, including one man wanted in connection with attacks in Casablanca in 2003. Mohamed El Bay is thought to have been trying to buy weapons and explosives. The arrests were made in Melilla, a Spanish enclave of about 68,000 people on Morocco's Mediterranean coast, with Spanish Civil Guards acting on international arrests warrants issued by Morocco, the ministry said in a written statement. Moroccan authorities have linked one of the suspects, Ali Aarass, to the Casablanca bombings in May 2003 that killed 33 bystanders and 12 suicide bombers. He is suspected of Islamic extremist activities during the past 16 years, the Spanish statement said. The other man, Mohamed El Bay, is wanted for alleged involvement with a terrorist network that Moroccan police broke up last February, when they arrested 30 people suspected of plotting attacks against Moroccan government targets, it said. Moroccan police seized numerous weapons in the February raids and later contacted European police for help in locating other suspects in the group. Morocco authorities believe El Bay may have been in charge of contacting Central European arms smugglers to get weapons and explosives for the alleged plot in Morocco, the Spanish statement said. Spanish police searched the homes of both suspects in Melilla and seized documentation, it said.

Jeremiah Wright on Monday said the black church, not him, had been subjected to attacks in the 2008 presidential campaign. Speaking before the National Press Club, Sen. Barack Obama's former pastor sought to give insight into the black church and clarify some of his remarks that have sparked a firestorm. Earlier this year, some of Wright's sermons, circulated and widely discussed on the Internet and on television, became an issue in the Democratic presidential race because of the former pastor's ties to Obama. Wright is a retired pastor from the Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, Illinois, where Obama worships. In one sermon, Wright said the U.S. had brought the September 11 attacks upon itself and said \"America's chickens are coming home to roost.\" Asked to explain those remarks, Wright said, \"Have you heard the whole sermon? ... No, you haven't heard the whole sermon. That nullifies that question.\"  Watch as Wright explains his 9/11 comments \u00bb . Wright said those who heard the entire sermon would have known that he was quoting the ambassador from Iraq and keeping in line with biblical principles. \"Jesus said, 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.' You cannot do terrorism on other people and expect it never to come back on you. Those are biblical principles, not Jeremiah Wright bombastic principles,\" he said.  Watch as Wright questions his critics' patriotism \u00bb . Wright shot back at the notion that Obama has walked away from him, saying the candidate \"distanced himself from some of my remarks. ... He had to distance himself, because he's a politician, from what the media was saying I had said, which was un-American.\" Obama, when asked what he could do to keep Wright's latest comments from dragging him down, replied: . \"I think people will understand that I am not perfect and that there are going to be folks in my past like Rev. Wright that may cause them some concern -- but that ultimately, my 20 years of service and the values that I've written about and spoken about and promoted are their values and what they're concerned about. And that's what this camp has been about and what it's going to continue to be about.\" Wright said sound bites from his sermons were taken out of context and said the black religious tradition, despite its long history, is in some ways \"invisible to the dominant culture.\" The theology of the black church is a \"theology of liberation, it is a theology of transformation and it is ultimately a theology of reconciliation,\" he said. Wright's remarks came a day after he addressed an audience of 10,000 at a dinner sponsored by the Detroit chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  Watch as Wright answers his critics at the NAACP event \u00bb . Reiterating some of the same points from that dinner, Wright said, \"Being different does not mean one is deficient -- it simply means one is different, like snowflakes.\" Wright said reconciliation means \"we embrace our individual rich histories.\" He said it also means rooting out \"any teaching of superiority, inferiority, hatred or prejudice\" and recognizing that each person \"is one of God's children ... no better, no worse.\" \"Only then will liberation, transformation and reconciliation become realities and cease being ever-elusive ideals,\" he said. At the height of the Wright controversy, Obama gave a speech on race relations, rejecting his ex-pastor's controversial comments but saying he could not repudiate the man himself. \"I'm not here for political reasons,\" Wright said Sunday. \"I am not a politician. I know that fact will surprise many of you because many in the corporate-owned media have made it seem as if I had announced that I'm running for the Oval Office. I am not running for the Oval Office. \"I've been running for Jesus a long, long time, and I'm not tired yet.\" Sen.

McCain on Sunday broached the topic of Wright unprompted for the first time despite previous suggestions the issue would be out of bounds in the presidential race.

Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe campaigns in the capital of Harare last week. Results were not expected until Sunday. The main opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change, alleged widespread irregularities and promised to release its own election results, defying a government order. Critics of the government have predicted that the elections will be rigged or marred by fraud, though the government has promised that they will be \"free and fair.\" At a news conference in Harare, Movement for Democratic Change Secretary-General Tenda Biti said that some of the party's agents have been chased away from polling stations. The party also said the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission claimed to have lost the accreditation for agents at 19 stations and refused to let them in. Biti said there was a \"massive\" deployment of soldiers and police at most stations. Journalists inside the country reported a heavy presence of the army and police but disagreed with Biti's description of it as \"massive.\" Police said they were investigating the bombing of a house in Harare belonging to a parliamentarian candidate from Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party. The bombing happened early Saturday, and it was not immediately clear whether it was connected to the elections, police said. No one was inside the home at the time. The Zimbabwean government has denied CNN and other international news organizations permission to enter the country to report on the elections. Read about reporting on the elections. The elections are posing one of the toughest challenges to Mugabe's 28-year rule. Two candidates, both from different factions of the opposition party, stand a good chance of unseating him. One opposition contender is Movement for Democratic Change founder Morgan Tsvangirai, who fought hotly contested challenges against the president in 2000, 2002 and 2005. The other is Mugabe's former finance minister, Simba Makoni. He was a member of the Zanu-PF party until he announced his bid to unseat Mugabe and the party kicked him out. Voter turnout was high after the polls opened at 7 a.m. (1 a.m. ET), journalists reported, but it tapered off throughout the day. Shortly before polls closed at 7 p.m. (1 p.m. ET), \"there was a rush of people to put in their last-minute votes\" in some places, media rights activist Reyhana Masters said. Biti also said police were assisting many voters in casting ballots. The opposition has spoken out against \"assistance\" in the voting booth, calling it an intimidation tactic, but Mugabe passed a presidential decree this week that said police could help those voters who are elderly or infirm.  Watch Zimbabweans worry their vote won't count \u00bb . The government has warned the opposition not to release its own election results, saying that doing so is the role of the electoral commission and could spark violence of the kind seen in Kenya after elections there late last year. Some Zimbabweans reported irregularities in Saturday's voting. Eddie Matsangaise of the Zimbabwe Exile Forum said he had heard that the names of long-dead white colonialist leaders were on voter lists, but voters who thought they were registered were turned away. Iden Wetherell, editor of the newspaper Zimbabwe Independent, said the opposition had found large numbers of voters registered at one address where there isn't a building. Voter confusion was also a problem. The elections are not just for president but also for parliamentary, senate and local council seats, meaning voters have to cast a number of ballots in a limited amount of time. Limited voter education means many registered voters were not told which ward to go to and may turn up at the wrong polling stations.  Watch claims of dead voters still on the rolls \u00bb . The absence of international media and independent observers has heightened critics' concerns. The United States this week warned of a possible unfair election, and New York-based Human Rights Watch warned this month that the elections were likely to be \"deeply flawed.\" Human Rights Watch said in a report that Zimbabwe's electoral commission is partisan toward Zanu-PF and lacks both expertise and resources to run the elections properly. An MDC official said this week that leaked correspondence from the electoral commission showed it had asked for 3.3 million more ballots than there are registered voters, including 250,000 extra postal ballots for soldiers and police. Tenda Biti, the opposition's secretary-general, said it was an indication of fraud. A hero of the country's civil war against the white Rhodesian government, Mugabe became the country's first black prime minister in 1980. But nearly three decades later, he has consolidated his rule over all aspects of Zimbabwean life, and the country does not appear better for it. His country was once revered for offering its citizens some of the best education and health care in Africa, but now, schooling is a luxury and Zimbabwe has one of the lowest life expectancies in the world. Zimbabwe was once known as the breadbasket of southern Africa, but now it is difficult to get even basic food supplies. Inflation has skyrocketed to more than 100,000 percent while food production and agricultural exports have dropped drastically.  Watch reasons for meltdown of Zimbabwe's economy \u00bb . Part of the economic freefall is traced to Mugabe's land redistribution policies, including his controversial seizure of commercially white-owned farms in 2000. Mugabe gave the land to black Zimbabweans who he said were cheated under colonialist rule, and white farmers who resisted were jailed. In 2005, Mugabe launched Operation Clean Out the Trash, in which he razed slum areas across the country.

Mehdi Kazemi believes he will face persecution if he is made to return to Iran. Mehdi Kazemi, 19, had originally sought asylum in Britain, where he was taking classes on a student visa, because, he said, his boyfriend had been executed in Iran after saying he and Kazemi had been in a gay relationship. Britain's Home Office rejected his request, prompting Kazemi to flee to Netherlands. Tuesday's decision by the Council of State -- the highest administrative court in the Netherlands --means Kazemi could face deportation to Britain, which he fears will send him back to Iran. Council spokeswoman Daniela Tempelman said the council decided it must comply with the Dublin Regulation and return Kazemi to Britain.  Watch how teenager has lost his right to remain. \u00bb . Under the Dublin Regulation, European Union member nations agree that an application for asylum submitted in any EU country would be handled by that country alone. The regulation seeks to ensures that an asylum seeker is not redirected from nation to nation simply because none will take responsibility. Kazemi's initial appeal for asylum in the Netherlands, made in October, was rejected. He then appealed unsuccessfully to a regional court in December. His last appeal was to the Council of State in January. Tempelman said that in order for the Dutch court to consider Kazemi's asylum application, he needed to prove that Britain did not handle his asylum application properly, but he wasn't able to prove any wrongdoing on the part of the British government. Kazemi now has exhausted his chances for appeal in the Netherlands and, according to Tempelman, could be returned to Britain on a short notice. The British government about six months ago accepted the Dutch request to take him back. Kazemi's lawyer will have the option of taking his case to the European Court of Human Rights to request an \"interim measure\" that could allow Kazemi to stay in Europe until further notice. \"If anybody signs his deportation papers and says, look, he's got to be deported to Iran, that means they have signed his death sentence,\" said Kazemi's uncle Saeed, who asked CNN to withhold his last name over safety concerns. Gay rights activists in Europe and Iran are also researching Kazemi's case. \"When Britain is prepared to send a young man back to possible execution, that is inhumanity on a monumental scale,\" said Peter Tatchell, an activist for gay campaign group OutRage. \"And I hang my head in shame, as a British citizen.\" In a written statement, Britain's Home Office said that even though homosexuality is illegal in Iran and homosexuals do experience discrimination, it does not believe that homosexuals are routinely persecuted purely on the basis of their sexuality.

The only evident light in this windowless room comes from the small bulb set into the bathroom cabinet; despite the whiteness of the walls, floor and bathroom fittings, it is a room that cannot hide its oppression as one of the few rooms that the three children, if reports are correct, have ever known.

His greatest concern is doing the job he is asked to do with skill and pride, protecting those abroad and at home and standing up to the standards he has set for himself,\" Samantha Schroeder said. iReporters shared an array of stories about how the Iraq war has affected them over the past five years. One man said he met his wife, a fellow service member, while serving in Iraq. Others described the pain of having fathers so far away, especially when new children are born. Some military wives said they often keep their true feelings to themselves, fearing that they would affect their husbands' morale in the field.  See photos, hear stories of sacrifice \u00bb . Below are a selection of responses from iReporters, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. Angela Fritz of Fort Hood, Texas \"Having [my husband] gone is the worst kind of pain. It is the burden I chose to bear but am not happy to. On the outside, I have to stand strong. I have to support my country and my husband, regardless of what I feel. That is the Army way. I am so proud of him for having the courage to step up and serve his country. On the inside, I am angry and worn thin. Of course, I want my husband home, but it's so much more than that now.\" Samantha Schroeder of Chester, Maryland \"I am the mother of a 19-year-old Marine. He joined while still in his senior year. When he came to me to sign his enlistment papers, I was hesitant. No, I was downright, 'Not in a million years.' He was only 17. How could I give him permission? Just wait, I asked, and think about it some more. He looked at me with a mixture of fear in thinking I might not sign and anger in knowing I didn't understand. And what he said next has stuck in my head through all his training, and now he leaves in a week for Iraq. He told me, 'Mom, I owe this to my country.' ... \"Now, as he prepares for Iraq deployment, I am a little better prepared for what the future holds mentally. But to me, he and most of the men who will accompany him are so young. They still seem like boys to me, but I know they are men. Willing to serve their country. I remember 9/11 like it was yesterday, and I also remember the fear that was on that seventh-grader's face when he was bused home early that day and watched the events unfold on the TV. And now he stands as a Marine, willing to sacrifice his everyday freedoms to assure we are safe here at home.\" Katherine Shigekane of Virginia Beach, Virginia \"The Iraq war has changed our lives in many ways. My husband has been serving in the Navy for 16 years, and since March 2003, he has been on four different deployments. Our lives have been affected in many ways. Our wedding plans were changed due to the invasion. He missed most of my first pregnancy. He was able to be home for the birth of our twins but left again when they were a year old and was gone until after their second birthday. He is now gone again. ... As a family I think we have learned to appreciate the time we do spend together.\" joshM  \"While serving in Iraq with the United States Marines, I met my wife. She is in the United States Army. We met while on R&R in Qatar. We did long distance for the remaining time that we had left of our deployment and then another year while I was still stationed in Cherry Point, North Carolina. She is still stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. After I separated from the Marines as a corporal, I moved to Kentucky to be with her. We are now happily married, and she is on her third tour to Iraq. So even though the news shows all the bad things of war, some good really does come from it.\" ChristopherM \"I am a soldier in the U.S. Army. I am a 20-year-old combat veteran. I returned home this past summer and enrolled in college with hopes of going to law school. Unfortunately, with future deployments likely to postpone my schooling, I will be in college long past traditional college years. That is just a minor nuisance compared with the fact that relating to my family and friends is infinitely more difficult since I've returned. I find myself zoning out and going back to the war during family functions and when I'm out with my friends, I apparently talk in my sleep about the war and occasionally sleepwalk.\" Sierra Derrick of Waymart, Pennsylvania \"This is the second time my husband is deploying to Iraq, and trust me, it only gets harder!! The first time, I was 17 years old, two months pregnant and a brand-new bride. (We got married literally the day before he left.) Now, exactly four years later, we are in the same situation, although things are a little different. Together we have two amazingly beautiful little boys, Connor and Carson, ages 3 and 1. Needless to say, he is their hero as well as mine. \"The impact that this war has had on our family has been extraordinary. We are so incredibly proud of him in ways that civilian families couldn't comprehend. We have been brought closer because of these deployments, and the support we have is absolutely phenomenal. \"In that sense, I believe it has been worth it.\" E-mail to a friend .", "ddedfc2a349fb607ed7efeda1660e9807454ddb7": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Videos of the chaos and horrified reactions after the July 7, 2005, London transit bombings were shown to jurors Thursday in the trial of three men charged with conspiracy in the case.

Supporters surround Mychal Bell on Thursday after his release at the LaSalle Parish courthouse. Bell's release followed an announcement from LaSalle Parish District Attorney Reed Walters, who said he would not appeal a higher court's decision moving Bell's case to juvenile court. Wearing a blue striped golf shirt and jeans, Bell walked out of the LaSalle Parish courthouse a week after an estimated 15,000-plus demonstrators marched through Jena -- a town of about 3,000 -- to protest local authorities' handling of the teens' case. \"We do not condone violence of any kind, but we ask that people be given a fair and even chance at the bar of justice,\" the Rev. Al Sharpton said outside the courthouse. \"Tonight, Mychal can go home, but Mychal is not out of the juvenile process. He goes home because a lot of people left their home and stood up for him,\" he said. \"Let America know -- we are not fighting for the right to fight in school. We're not fighting for the right for kids to beat each other. We're fighting to say that there must be one level of justice for everybody. And you cannot have adult attempted murder for some, and a fine for others, and call that equal protection under the law. Two wrongs don't make one civil right.\" Demonstrators at last week's march were protesting how authorities handled the cases of Bell and five other teens accused of beating fellow student Justin Barker. Many said they were angry that the students, dubbed the Jena 6, were being treated more harshly than three white students who hung nooses from an oak tree on Jena High School property. The white students were suspended from school but did not face criminal charges. The protesters said they should have been charged with a hate crime. Bell's attorney Lewis Scott said the teen was moved from jail to a juvenile facility earlier Thursday. Walters said his decision not to appeal was based on what he believed was best for the victim in the case. \"While I believe that a review would have merit ... I believe it is in the best interest of the victim and his family not to delay this matter any further and move it to its conclusion,\" Walters told reporters.  Watch the Rev. Al Sharpton discuss the teen's release \u00bb . He said last week's march, which included Sharpton and Martin Luther King III, did not influence his decision. Bell, now 17, was the only one of the Jena 6 behind bars. His bond previously was set at $90,000. A district judge earlier this month tossed out Bell's conviction for conspiracy to commit second-degree battery, saying the matter should have been handled in juvenile court. The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeal in Lake Charles, Louisiana, did the same with Bell's battery conviction in mid-September. Prosecutors originally charged all six black students accused of being involved in beating Barker with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy. Walters reduced charges against at least four of them -- Bell, Robert Bailey Jr., Carwin Jones and Theo Shaw -- to battery and conspiracy. Bryant Purvis awaits arraignment. Charges against Jesse Ray Beard, who was 14 at the time of the alleged crime, are unavailable because he's a juvenile. Wednesday, Gov. Kathleen Blanco announced that Louisiana State Police officers will protect the families of the Jena 6 and investigate any threats they have received. A white supremacist Web site posted the names and addresses of the six black teens after last week's march, calling on followers to \"let them know justice is coming.\" Thursday, the FBI said it had been made aware of allegations of threats. \"Threats are taken seriously, and as these investigations are ongoing we cannot comment further,\" said Sheila Thorne of the FBI's office in New Orleans, Louisiana. The December 4 attack on Barker came after months of racial tension, including at least two instances of fighting in the town, sparked originally when three white teens hung the nooses. Walters has said there was no direct link between the hanging of the nooses and the schoolyard attack, and defended the prosecutions ahead of last Thursday's peaceful march. Blanco defended the prosecutor Wednesday, saying, \"He has a solid record and is highly respected among his peers.\" Walters also addressed the stress and notoriety the town has been subjected to, saying the only way he and other residents \"have been able to endure the trauma that has been thrust upon us is through the prayers of the Christian people who have sent them up in this community.\" He also suggested that some kind of \"disaster\" was averted when thousands of marchers came to Jena last week. \"I firmly believe and am confident of the fact that had it not been for the direct intervention of the Lord Jesus Christ last Thursday, a disaster would have happened,\" Walters said. \"The Lord Jesus Christ put his influence on those people, and they responded accordingly,\" he said, without explaining exactly what he meant. Soon after the district attorney spoke, a local reverend took issue with his comments. \"Obviously, we are serving two different gods here,\" the Rev. Donald Sidley said. \"My Bible says that we should do -- we should be loving, love your neighbor as yourself. \"For him to try and separate the community like he is and then using Christ Jesus to influence the people that Jesus is working on their side, well, that's -- that's absurd. ... God is god of the human race,\" said Sidley, of the New Evergreen Church.

The United Nations estimates 2.5 million people have been forced from their homes in Darfur. The prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, made the observation in a progress report to the U.N. Security Council into its probe of crimes in Darfur and the status of two men indicted for war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Darfur region of Sudan. He said the Sudanese government \"has taken no steps to arrest\" the men, one of whom is now in charge of the government's humanitarian affairs. The other is a militia leader. \"For the last five years the whole Darfur area has been a crime scene. Girls are raped, schools are bombed. ... And they are covering up these crimes,\" Moreno-Ocampo said at a news conference at the United Nations Thursday. The court says Darfurians are attacked in their villages and in camps, citing rapes, bombings of schools and arrests of community leaders. \"Crimes being committed today in Darfur cannot be denied, or minimized. Decisions to commit crimes, to deny crimes, to disguise crimes are taken at the highest level. Denial of crimes, by the authorities that vowed to protect Darfurians, is an additional harm to the victims,\" the report said. The ICC cases are against Ali Kushayb, a militia leader, and Ahmad Harun, former minister of state for the interior in Sudan, who is now in charge of humanitarian affairs for the Sudanese government. Both face charges of murder, rape, forced displacement and other offenses during the Darfur crisis, which the United States characterizes as a genocide. Harun's present role gives him power over how and whether aid agencies can deliver food, medicine and shelter to victims of chronic violence and deprivation in Darfur. \"He attacks the people he has the responsibility to protect,\" the International Criminal Court said in a statement. \"He hampers the delivery of relief to the victims. He is involved in obstructing deployment of the peacekeepers.\" Alleged crimes in the region stem from a brutal counter-insurgency campaign the Sudanese government conducted after rebels began an uprising in the Darfur region of western Sudan in 2003. The authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur on a campaign of killing, torture and rape, according to the United Nations, western governments and human-rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels draw strength. About 300,000 people have died in Darfur, the United Nations estimates, and 2.5 million have been forced from home. In 2005, the Security Council cleared the way for possible war crimes prosecutions by the International Criminal Court, a permanent tribunal set up to handle prosecutions related to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The court is based on a treaty signed by 106 nations -- excluding Sudan. Prosecutors are investigating offenses in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda and the Central African Republic. Once the court indicts someone, authorities in one country or another have the power to detain the indicted person for trial at The Hague. That has not happened in the case of Harun and Kushayb. An arrest warrant for Harun charges that he was involved in the murder, rape, torture and forced displacement of civilians. The court also says he encouraged such illegal acts in public speeches during his tenure as minister of state for the interior. The criminal court says Kushayb led several thousand militia members and personally participated in attacks against civilians. An arrest warrant outlines numerous cases of murder, rape and inhumane acts. In Sudan, however, senior government leaders told CNN that reports of atrocities in Darfur were exaggerated. \"Yes, there has been a war and some people have died, but it's not like what has been reflected in the media,\" said Interior Minister Ibrahim Mahmoud Hamid. Musa Halil, an adviser to Sudan's president, has been accused by the United States of leading a militia responsible for atrocities. And the U.N. Security Council has frozen his assets. Yet he denies any wrongdoing. \"There is no genocide,\" he told CNN. \"Most people came to the refugee camps because of the pressure and were used there for political marketing.\" Others told a different story. In Darfur, eyewitnesses spoke of government airplanes and helicopters attacking defenseless civilians just four months ago. They said the government struck in coordination with militiamen riding horses and camels -- a classic pattern that has unfolded around Darfur in recent years. More than 115 people were killed in that attack, they said, and nearly 58,000 people fled.

Arthur Mkoyan, 17, was 2 years old when his family came to the United States. \"I haven't been in Armenia since I was 2, so I don't really know anything about the place,\" said Arthur Mkoyan, 17. \"All I've seen is just videos my mom has watched on the Internet.\" Mkoyan's long-term plans were turned upside down one morning in April when two immigration officers arrived at the door of his family's house. \"They took both of my parents, and they released my mom because she had to take care of us, since me and my brother are minors,\" he recalled. \"But instead they took my dad away to a detention center in Arizona.\" Mkoyan, who has a grade-point average above 4.0 -- extra credit for Advanced Placement classes makes that possible -- is set to graduate next week from Bullard High School in Fresno, California.  Watch students from Arthur's school talk about his case \u00bb . Ten days later, Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to deport him and his family to the Armenian capital city of Yerevan, the same city his family fled in fear 16 years ago. Back then, Mkoyan's father, Ruben Mkoian (he and his son spell their last names differently), was a sergeant in an Armenian equivalent of a department of motor vehicles, according to a court document. \"He was approached with a bribe to register stolen vehicles. He refused. A co-worker took the bribe. Mkoian reported the incident to the chief of the DMV, who told him to mind his own business,\" the document states. \"Subsequently, he and his family were subjected to attacks he believed were attempts to silence him about corruption at the DMV.\" In what the family considers one such attempt, their house was set on fire in 1992. That led the father to send his family to Russia and then to the United States, Arthur Mkoyan said. They arrived in the United States in 1995 on six-month tourist visas, according to Virginia Kice, a public information officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The family settled in Fresno, where Mkoian worked as a truck driver and his wife worked in a jewelry store. They set about living their lives, which soon included a younger brother for Arthur. But after the visas expired, the family's application to remain in the United States was denied. In 2002, an immigration judge ruled that they had no legal basis to remain in the country, Kice said. After their application to the Board of Immigration Appeals was rejected, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year denied their petition for a hearing. The court was unpersuaded by the father's assertion that he might still be subject to reprisal if he were to return. \"Mkoian's fear that Armenian officials would be unable or unwilling to protect him seems unfounded because he provided little evidence that they were unable or unwilling to protect him in the past,\" the appeals court said. To Kice, it's a simple matter of enforcing the law. \"I would remind people that this family had ample access to due process,\" she said. \"The case has been in litigation for more than 10 years. Immigration experts on every level determined that they had no legal basis to be in the United States.\" She noted that the government agreed to delay their deportation so Arthur can graduate with his class. Arthur's schoolmates at Bullard are shocked that his academic achievements haven't helped his case. \"It's really hard to get good grades in this school,\" freshman Alex Stewart told affiliate KGPE. \"It's a challenging school, so to get a 4.0, you really gotta try.\" Still, a longer-term reprieve remains possible, if unlikely. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, may attempt to pass a \"private bill\" that would allow the family to remain in the United States. \"Our office is looking into the case,\" said Scott Gerber, a spokesman for the senator. But the odds against it are long. There is \"almost no chance\" that the family's quest for a private bill will succeed, said Daniel Kowalski, editor-in-chief of Bender's Immigration Bulletin. \"Very few are being passed,\" he said. In fact, of the 21 private immigration bills introduced last year, none was enacted. In 2006, 117 were introduced, and none was enacted; in 2005, 98 were introduced, and four were enacted. But the filing itself would buy the family time, since it suspends any efforts to deport the family until the bill's fate is determined. Arthur appeared undaunted. He appealed to a reporter to publicize his e-mail address (artmkoyan@gmail.com) so he can forward any letters of support to Feinstein. Meanwhile, the academic skills he has displayed in Fresno may not easily translate to college in Armenia. Arthur said he understands only a few words of Armenian.", "9f997964709283520a65d2ce75de7c8b154ce351": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- After months of stalemate, the Senate late Tuesday passed a huge government spending bill that includes billions of dollars requested by President Bush to continue the war in Iraq. White House officials have said President Bush would sign off on the spending plan if the Iraq money was added. The roughly $555 billion bill -- which passed 76-17 -- also preserves thousands of earmarks for lawmakers who will deliver them to constituents just in time for the holidays. The final vote came at about 11 p.m. ET Tuesday -- after hours of debate that included two more attempts by Senate Democrats to tie war funding to a plan to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq. Those efforts failed, as have dozens of others in the House and Senate since Democrats took control of Congress last year. Earlier, members voted to add $40 billion for the war in Iraq that had been removed by the House -- which passed the spending bill on Monday. The plan also includes $30 billion for troops in Afghanistan. Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who co-sponsored the push to reinstate the Iraq money, called its approval \"a very powerful bipartisan message of support for our men and women serving in Iraq.\" White House officials have said Bush would sign the spending plan if the Iraq money was added. In the weeks leading up to the vote, Bush had repeatedly pushed members of Congress to approve a military spending bill that did not place troop-withdrawal requirements on the military in Iraq. The bill wraps together 11 of the 12 government spending bills for 2008 -- except for that of the Department of Defense, which was already funded. Facing a president determined to keep spending in check and a unified Republican minority in the House and Senate, Democrats have been stymied at nearly every turn in their attempts to increase spending on their domestic priorities. Fearing a politically dangerous government shutdown, Democratic leaders ultimately gave in to Bush's top line number and trimmed $22 billion from the measure. But Democrats stemmed their losses somewhat by shifting some funding from the president's priorities to their own. And they added billions more above Bush's top line in \"emergency\" funding for veterans health care, California fires, border security and more. The government spending watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, which scrambled Monday to pore over the nearly 1,500-page bill that was made public late Sunday night, said it has identified almost 9,000 earmarks worth $7.4 billion. Many of the earmarks avoided normal congressional scrutiny and were \"airdropped\" -- or slipped in without going through normal committee consideration -- into the final bill, the group said. But Sen. Robert Byrd, D-West Virginia, chairman of the budget-writing appropriations committee, said the spending plan represents a dramatic decrease in pork-barrel projects from the one approved by Bush two years ago -- when Republicans controlled Congress. \"The total dollars that are earmarked is reduced -- hear me now -- by 43 percent,\" Byrd said Tuesday from the Senate floor. \"That ain't chicken feed.\" Arguing for a plan that would have begun pulling troops from Iraq within 90 days, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, became emotional as he called the Bush administration's efforts in Iraq \"a continuing quagmire.\" \"The best way to end this charade and protect our troops and our national security is to put the Iraqis on notice that they need to take responsibility for their future,\" Kennedy said. \"Unless there's a binding timeline for the redeployment of our troops, the Iraqis will not feel the need to make the compromises essential for a political solution.\" The measure now goes back to the House for approval in its revised form. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she expects the bill to pass the House, although she will vote against it because of the war funds added in the Senate version. E-mail to a friend .

Longo-Ciprelli: Fourth time lucky in Atlanta in 1996. For much of her career, the Olympic gold was the one honor to elude the French rider. Misfortune, it seemed, was to be her fate every four years, regardless of how many world championships she won in between. In 1984 the first women's Olympic road race coincided with Longo-Ciprelli's rise to dominance in the sport. Well-placed going into the final lap, she appeared set to challenge in the sprint, only to be knocked off in a collision. By 1988, Longo-Ciprelli was a three-time road race world champion, as well as a double winner of the women's Tour de France, and the clear favorite for gold in Seoul. But a broken hip a month before the Games derailed her preparations. Although she recovered enough to ride the road race, she could manage just 21st place. Tactical error More disappointment followed in Barcelona in 1992 as Longo-Ciprelli paid the price for a tactical error. With three kilometers to go, she raced away from the peloton and crossed the line in celebration. But she had failed to realize that Kathy Watt, an unheralded Australian, had slipped away from the lead group apparently unnoticed with a lap to go, and finished 20 seconds further in front. Four years later, in Atlanta, Longo-Ciprelli, finally cracked her Olympic jinx. At 37, Longo-Ciprelli was no longer the dominant presence she had once been, but she still possessed the ability to raise her performance for the biggest races, as she had proven by winning her fourth road race world title in 1995. Her preparations were typically unorthodox -- while her rivals were acclimatizing to the Atlanta heat, Longo-Ciprelli trained alone in the mountains of Colorado, arriving just two days before the race. The race itself was run in a sudden downpour, which sent many riders crashing and skidding and had the rest struggling to stay on their bikes. Unruffled, Longo-Ciprelli broke clear with two other riders and then launched her gold-winning solo attack 11 kilometers from the finish. Longo-Ciprelli was back for her fifth and final Olympics in Sydney in 2000 at the age of 41, this time claiming bronze in the time trial -- and event in which she had also won silver in 1996.

On Thursday, Bout and his associate, Andrew Smulian, were arrested in Thailand after a series of events that officials said could have come straight out of a spy novel. The men's capture involved law enforcement agencies from at least five countries, including two undercover agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration posing as Colombian rebels. Bout and Smulian are accused of conspiracy to provide surface-to-air missiles and other weapons to Colombian rebels, said Michael Garcia, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. In a complaint filed by a DEA agent, they are said to have conspired to sell millions of dollars worth of weapons to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The U.S. Department of State designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization in 2003. \"This marks the end of the reign of one of the world's most-wanted arms traffickers,\" Garcia said of Bout. \"Someone will undoubtedly write a book about this case someday, and I can tell you that it will read like the very best work of Tom Clancy, only in this case, it won't be fiction,\" said Michael Braun, assistant administrator and chief of operations for the DEA. Secret meetings . The operation began in January, when Smulian began meeting with two men who claimed to represent FARC but who were actually confidential sources working for the DEA. The men expressed interest in buying millions of dollars worth of weapons. At meetings in the Netherlands Antilles, Denmark and Romania, Smulian discussed the details and logistics of the arms deal with the two agents. At one meeting, the agents were given a digital memory stick containing an article about Bout and documents containing photos and specifications for 100 surface-to-air missiles and armor-piercing rocket launchers. Smulian explained that a delivery system was in place that would allow the weapons to be air-dropped into Colombia, and he told the men that it would cost $5 million to transport the weapons. During one meeting, Smulian introduced the DEA sources to Bout over the phone. After that conversation, Smulian told one of the sources that the weapons were ready in Bulgaria. Smulian and Bout set up a face-to-face meeting with them to finalize the deal, and that is what happened Thursday. The arrests were made Thursday afternoon. The charges against Bout and Smulian cover the period from November through February, according to a written statement from the U.S. attorney's office and the DEA. The United States plans to pursue the extradition of Bout from Thailand, the statement said. There was no mention of Smulian's fate. Bout and Smulian are charged with conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. If convicted, each could get a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, the statement said. 'I'm not a diamond guy' Intelligence agencies around the world have tracked Bout for years. Although some of his work has been legitimate, most has not. He has made deliveries to Africa, Asia and the Mideast using obsolete or surplus Soviet-era cargo planes. Bout, a former Soviet air force officer who speaks multiple languages, has what is reputed to be the largest private fleet of Soviet-era cargo aircraft in the world, according to U.S. officials. He acquired the planes shortly after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the U.S. Department of the Treasury said in 2005. At that time, the U.S. Treasury announced that it was freezing the assets of Bout and his associates, who are all tied to former Liberian President Charles Taylor. Taylor is being tried on war crimes charges by the Special Court for Sierra Leone. Intelligence officials said Bout shipped large quantities of small arms to civil wars across Africa and Asia, often taking diamonds in payment from West African fighters. A 2006 article in Foreign Policy magazine said that although Bout served many third-world leaders, he also aided organizations such as the United Nations. \"He made countless trips for the United Nations into the same areas where he supplied the weapons that sparked the humanitarian crises in the first place,\" the article charged. It said Bout probably committed multiple violations of U.N. arms embargoes. British intelligence officials found evidence in Afghanistan that Bout had shipped arms to the Taliban and al Qaeda, as well as circumstantial evidence that he shipped weapons technology into Iraq. And the U.S. government said it received information that Bout profited $50 million from supplying the Taliban with military equipment when they ruled Afghanistan. Bout, who is said to be the inspiration for Nicolas Cage's arms dealer character in the movie \"Lord of War,\" told CNN in 2002 that he never sold arms to the Taliban or al Qaeda. He also denied providing weapons and missile-guidance technology to Iraq. Bout said that his air transport company is legitimate and that he ferried a variety of cargo to Africa and to Afghanistan since 1992. He denied that any of it was done illegally or that he was paid in \"blood diamonds\" from Africa. \"It's a lie,\" he said. \"I never touched diamonds in my life, and I'm not a diamond guy, and I don't want to go into that business.\" Some reports at the time claimed that Bout flew into Afghanistan just before September 11, 2001. But Bout told CNN that the last time he was in Afghanistan was 1996 and that he never met terror mastermind Osama bin Laden.

The work by Doris Salcedo begins as a hairline crack then widens and deepens as it snakes across the full 167 meters (548 feet) of the former power station's Turbine Hall. Salcedo said \"Shibboleth,\" a statement about racism, took her more than a year to make but has revealed little else about its construction. She apparently created it elsewhere and spent the past five weeks installing it in the Tate, on the south bank of the River Thames. She refused to say how she managed seemingly to crack open a concrete floor. \"What is important is the meaning of the piece. The making of it is not important,\" she said. Asked how deep the crack goes, she replied: \"It's bottomless. It's as deep as humanity.\" Visitors meanwhile are warned not to trip on the crack. Tate director Nicholas Serota insisted the work was no optical illusion. \"This sculpture has been made in the most painstaking, meticulous way by Doris and her team before it was slowly inserted into the Turbine Hall,\" he told the Press Association. \"It has taken five weeks of work here with very considerable disruption to the hall. It's not an illusion - it's there, it's real. \"From the Tate's point of view, there were only two questions: could we realize it in the way Doris envisaged? And once the piece was created, would it damage the structural integrity of the building forever? \"The answer to the first was yes, and to the second was no.\" He declined to elaborate further. The installation will be removed next April by filling in the crack. Serota said: \"There is a crack, there is a line, and eventually there will be a scar and that scar will remain. It will remain as a memory of the work and also as a memorial to the issues Doris touches on.\" The artist said the work of art represents the gap between white Europeans and the rest of humanity. Wire mesh is on show because it is \"the most common means of control used to define borders and divisions.\" Salcedo said of the work: \"It represents borders, the experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience of racial hatred. \"It is the experience of a Third World person coming into the heart of Europe. \"For example, the space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space. And so this piece is a negative space.\"  E-mail to a friend .", "fab941df6ecc8251b49d28715504baf4ac31dcf9": "(CNN) -- Armenian President Robert Kocharian declared a state of emergency Saturday night after a day of clashes between police and protesters, a spokeswoman for the Armenian Foreign Ministry said. The protesters claim last month's presidential election was rigged. The state of emergency will \"hopefully bring some order\" to the capital, Yerevan, said Salpi Ghazarian, assistant to the Armenian foreign minister, who spoke to CNN early Sunday. The state of emergency could last until March 20, she said, but the government hopes \"that it will be lifted sooner.\" The clashes began when authorities used force to clear Freedom Square of thousands of demonstrators who had camped there for the past 10 days, according to a U.S. Embassy official. Ghazarian said the authorities \"moved in\" because \"they thought that there were arms there, and it turned out that they were right.\"  Watch a report on clashes between police and the opposition \u00bb . The embassy official estimated that the demonstrations in Freedom Square grew to as many as 60,000 Armenians at times over the last 10 days. As of early Sunday morning, Freedom Square was empty, Ghazarian said, but the protesters were demonstrating in a main square elsewhere in the city.  Watch Ghazarian discuss the situation in Armenia \u00bb . \"What is happening on the streets of Yerevan is people protesting what they consider to be unfair elections,\" Ghazarian said. \"After the president was forced to declare a state of emergency, things have quieted down. There are a couple of burning cars, and there are a few hurt people,\" she said. \"We're convinced that this will come to an end soon.\" She did not elaborate on the number of people injured or the extent of their injuries. Witnesses told CNN that Saturday morning's action by Armenian riot police was bloody, but the U.S. official said there were no confirmed deaths or serious injuries. An Armenian woman interviewed by CNN said there was \"huge chaos\" when police moved in. \"These are innocent people,\" she said. \"They just want their freedom. They just want to be heard. They are being beaten up, some people have horrible wounds.\" She asked that CNN not use her name because she feared for her safety. As night fell Saturday, the sounds of gunfire could be heard from the direction of the protesters' gathering, and tracer fire could be seen in the sky, according to another Yerevan resident, who also asked not to be identified out of fear for his safety. The man said his wife saw two demonstrators hit by a police car earlier in the day. The car initially did not stop, he said, but the protesters surrounded the car, dragged the officers out and burned the vehicle, he said. The officers were able to escape, he said, but he did not know the condition of the protesters who were struck. The protests began soon after the February 19 presidential election. Opposition presidential candidate Levon Ter-Petrosian lost to Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian, a political ally of outgoing President Kocharian. The opposition party immediately accused the government of vote fraud and demanded that the results be voided. Ghazarian said Sunday that the government had reached out to the opposition. \"We are hoping with the help of the international community, the opposition, the leader of the opposition, will come and enter a political dialogue rather than continuing this debate on the streets,\" she said. Haroutiun Khachatrian, editor of the Noyan Tappan News Agency, told CNN that riot police arrested several hundred people in the square Saturday morning, including many opposition party officials. Ter-Petrosian was there but was not arrested, he said. The opposition vowed to pursue its claims through legal means. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitored last month's Armenian election and concluded that it was mostly in line with international standards, although it did include some criticism in its report. The U.S. Embassy has warned the several hundred Americans living in Yerevan to stay at home and avoid the downtown area where the demonstrations have been taking place, the U.S. official said.

Canadian NATO-led soldiers walk patrol near Kandahar, Afghanistan. James Appathurai told reporters at a briefing that the move will help NATO meet Canada's requirement that it send more troops to the volatile southern province of Kandahar, where Canadian troops are based. Canada agreed this month to extend its commitment of about 2,500 troops until 2011 so long as NATO contributes more troops to Kandahar. There is a \"clear unity in the alliance\" that the mission in Afghanistan must succeed, Appathurai said. Though 25 NATO allies and 13 other countries have contributed forces, the bulk of the recent fighting has been done by U.S., Canadian, British and Dutch troops. Appathurai also said Thursday that he did not expect NATO applicants Georgia and Ukraine to be put on a membership action plan this summit but, he said, the general sense in terms of membership for the two countries is not \"whether, but when.\" Further discussions regarding those two countries is to resume Thursday, he said. U.S. President George W. Bush has pushed for the admission of Ukraine and Georgia to the military alliance. However, Russia -- which is not a NATO member -- has expressed concerns about the former Soviet republics joining NATO, which has already made members of other former Soviet countries Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. Appathurai also said a general consensus could not be reached on Macedonia's bid, because of Greece's objections. Greece has threatened to veto Macedonia's bid if its northern neighbor does not agree to change its name. Athens has long argued that the name Macedonia implies territorial claims on its northern province of the same name -- the birthplace, also, of Greece's most revered ancient warrior, Alexander the Great.

Sheikh Jalal al-Din Ali al-Saghir is a parliament member and a representative of the most influential Shiite cleric. Sheikh Jalal al-Din Ali al-Saghir, speaking at Buratha Mosque, blamed the corruption on followers of anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Al-Saghir is the most senior representative in Baghdad of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, arguably the most influential Shiite cleric in Iraq. As a member of Iraq's parliament, Al-Saghir represents the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, part of the ruling United Iraqi Alliance. His political group dominates the Iraqi security forces and has been fighting members of a rival Shiite group, al-Sadr's Mehdi Army militia. He said the Supreme Council, part of the ruling United Iraqi Alliance, once had an armed group called the Badr Brigade that is now a renamed non-military organization. He repeated Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's call for all armed groups not affiliated with the government to disband. \"We said from the beginning, and since 2003, the necessity of laying down the weapons by all, and the weapons should be in the hand of the state,\" al-Saghir said. He praised Iraqi security forces' efforts in Basra, the southern Shiite city where al-Maliki launched an offensive in March. The cleric said al-Maliki freed the region of gangs. \"We can say that the Iraqi security forces have made a great change in terms of establishing the security and imposing the law,\" al-Saghir said, adding that effective security must be imposed to ensure the fairness of this autumn's provincial elections. \"The elections will be tomorrow,\" he said, meaning soon. \"How can we respect ourselves as politicians, political parties and officials within the government? How can we respect ourselves by saying we conduct honest elections while there are gangs controlling areas or provinces?\" Meanwhile, Sadrist cleric Suhail al-Iqabi delivered a fiery sermon in the eastern part of Baghdad as hundreds of Sadr City residents sat on the street performing Friday prayers. Al-Iqabi said an \"act of genocide\" is taking place in the town. Speaking to hundreds of worshippers chanting pro-Sadr slogans, al-Iqabi accused the government of holding a grudge against Sadrists and the people of Sadr City \"who are facing genocide in every sense of the word, cutting off the water, electricity and shelling the innocent civilians, killing women and children and detaining women.\" His sermon included a prayer asking God to strengthen al-Sadr's Mehdi army and \"sharpen their weapons.\" \"What the prime minister stated in his press conference, all that he said that was so far from reality, the nonsense and false accusations he used to cover up his huge failure leading the nation's affairs,\" al-Iqabi said. \"... We call on all politicians, journalists, intellectuals, civil society institutions, tribal leaders and clergy to visit Sadr City to witness the crimes committed by the occupier and government forces.\" In Sadr City, nearly 1,000 civilians and fighters are thought to have been killed since late March in fighting between security forces and Shiite militants. However, al-Saghir said there has been \"good security progress.\"  Watch as fighting destroys a school \u00bb . \"I believe the coming days will witness many developments which will lead to the protection of this city from these gangs,\" he said. He urged people who have grievances to make their voices heard through the political process. He decried those who arm themselves under the pretext of sectarianism or occupation. Al-Saghir emphasized what he called corruption in Sadr City and the role of Sadrist followers in promoting it. He noted that imams from the Supreme Council were booted from several mosques and replaced by politically correct imams, and he said companies have to pay off the Sadrists to get contracts. He said fuel tanker drivers face the risk of losing their trucks to fire or theft if they don't pay off political groups. Meanwhile Friday, a U.S. soldier was killed in Baghdad after a roadside bomb struck the soldier's vehicle, the military said. The soldier was part of a combat patrol in eastern Baghdad when a roadside bomb struck the patrol vehicle at about 6:15 p.m. local time. The soldier's name is being withheld until family has been notified, the U.S. army's public affairs department in Baghdad said. Also Friday, the U.S. military said one of the two suicide bombers who struck a wedding convoy this week in northern Iraq was a woman \"imitating pregnancy.\" The military blamed the Sunni militant group al Qaeda in Iraq for Thursdays' attack that killed 35 people and wounded dozens more in Balad Ruz, a town northeast of Baghdad in the volatile Diyala province. The U.S. military announced Friday that a U.S. Air Force drone crashed in southern Iraq, and investigators suspect mechanical failure. The MQ-1 Predator drone was used mainly for reconnaissance, the military said. On Thursday, Iraqi lawmakers were in Iran to confront officials there with evidence of Tehran's support for militias and outlaws in Iraq, Iraqi officials said. Iran's state-run news agency IRNA confirmed the delegation was in Tehran. Parliament members from the ruling United Iraqi Alliance, the Shiite coalition, intended to discuss how the training and arming of militias is harmful for Iraq -- and for Iran as a neighbor, said Sami al-Askari, an adviser to al-Maliki. Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman said the delegation intended to provide evidence, confessions and pictures indicating that Iran is supplying weapons and training fighters inside Iraq.

Actor Heath Ledger, 28, died January 22 at an apartment in Lower Manhattan. Ledger, 28, an Oscar-nominated Australian actor, died of an accidental overdose of six types of medication, according to the New York City medical examiner's office. The medical examiner's office said Ledger \"died as the result of acute intoxication by the combined effects of oxycodone, hydrocodone, diazepam, temazepam, alprazolam and doxylamine.\" Oxycodone and hydrocodone are pain medications; diazepam -- also known as Valium -- is used to treat anxiety; temazepam is a sedative used to induce sleep; alprazolam -- known by the trade name Xanax -- is an anti-anxiety agent. Doxylamine, an antihistamine, can be obtained over the counter as a sleep aid. The law enforcement source said the federal drug investigators are trying to determine if the drugs were prescribed legally, and are looking at two doctors -- one based in California and another in Texas. Ledger's first American film was the teen comedy \"10 Things I Hate About You\" in 1999. He passed up several scripts before taking a role in the Revolutionary War drama \"The Patriot\" in 2000 and \"A Knight's Tale\" in 2001. He also played a supporting role in \"Monster's Ball.\" But Ledger was perhaps best known for his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in \"Brokeback Mountain,\" Ang Lee's film about two cowboys who had a secret romantic relationship.

The drug can keep potentially life-threatening blood clots from forming in the veins, arteries, and lungs. In early February, the Food and Drug Administration launched an investigation and then a recall of some forms of the product. The scrutiny began after a spike in reports of health problems associated with heparin, a drug made by Baxter from pig intestines at plants in China and Wisconsin. Though the cause of the problems has not been determined, FDA investigators found \"a heparin-like compound -- that is not heparin -- present in some of the active pharmaceutical ingredients\" in both facilities, said Dr. Janet Woodcock, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The contaminant, which made up 5 percent to 20 percent of each sample tested, \"reacts like heparin in some of the conventional tests used for heparin,\" which explains why it was not picked up, she told reporters in a conference call. No causal link between the contaminant and the adverse events has been established yet, Woodcock said. She added that it was not clear whether the contaminant was added accidentally, as part of the processing or deliberately. It also was not clear whether the contaminant was introduced in the company's plant in Wisconsin or the one in China, Woodcock said. Though she said the exact structure of the contaminant has not been identified, \"it is similar to heparin glycans.\" Glycans are polysaccharides, a complex class of carbohydrate. She added it was unclear whether other heparin products used outside the United States might also contain the product. Later this week, the agency will release recommendations on how manufacturers and regulators can screen for the contaminant, she said. Last year, pet food made in China was found to be tainted with an ingredient that replaced more expensive protein and that initial tests did not identify as a contaminant. Asked if the heparin contamination could be a similar case, Woodcock said, \"It's possible.\" Doctors have used the blood-thinner for 60 years with \"no history of any problems whatsoever,\" said the FDA commissioner, Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach. Its intravenous use can keep potentially life-threatening blood clots from forming in the veins, arteries and lungs. Von Eschenbach said it would be \"disingenuous\" to expect the agency would be able to inspect \"every institution in every case.\" Over the last fiscal year, the agency reported having inspected more than 1,000 foreign plants, a record. Since the agency issued its report that 19 deaths had been linked to the drug since January 1, 2007, it has received word of another 27 deaths, \"but many of those do not fit our definition of this type of event,\" Woodcock said. In all, the FDA has received 785 heparin-linked reports of adverse events -- including difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, excessive sweating and plummeting blood pressure that can lead to life-threatening shock. \"They're continuing to come in fairly rapidly because there has been a lot of reporting of this,\" she said. In a written statement, Baxter said its tests have suggested \"that the root cause may be associated with the crude heparin, sourced from China, or from the subsequent processing of that product before it reaches Baxter.\" Meanwhile, Scientific Protein Laboratories LLC, which supplies the company with the active pharmaceutical ingredients, issued a statement saying it is working with the FDA, Baxter and outside experts to identify the cause of the adverse events. \"Thus far, no conclusions have been reached about the root cause,\" it said. \"It is premature to conclude that the heparin active pharmaceutical ingredient sourced from China and provided by SPL to Baxter is responsible for these adverse events.\" It said that its voluntary recall of suspect product was being made as a precaution.

But it also criticized the UK government for tightening restrictions on Russians traveling in the opposite direction, imposed following the apparent murder of the exiled Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. \"If we had an agreement similar to the one Russia has in place with EU, most problems could have been avoided,\" the statement said. The embassy also criticized the UK for imposing \"cumbersome\" visa requirements on supporters of the Russian side, Zenit St. Petersburg, which could reach the UEFA Cup final in Manchester on May 14, including biometric tests, online-only applications and interviews with consulate officials. But there was speculation as well on Thursday that Moscow may be prepared to temporarily lift some visa requirements in a gesture of good will. The UK's Times newspaper quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying that Russian authorities would waive the need for visa applicants to produce a letter of invitation in the case of ticket holders. UEFA communications director William Gaillard praised Russia's flexibility on Wednesday and said a simplified visa application procedure could be in place by the end of the week. \"The Russians have shown great flexibility and hopefully within the next 48 hours we will be announcing a more simplified procedure for visas to make it easier for fans to get to Moscow,\" Gaillard told the UK's Press Association. Manchester United Chief Executive David Gill said on Wednesday that those traveling on official club packages were assured of a visa. \"If you are on an organized trip, your ticket will be your visa. The actual specifics and fine details will be addressed in the next day or so and then we will communicate with the fans. \"Everyone recognizes in order for it to be a showcase, which it clearly will be, you have to ease entry into the country while not totally doing away with what the Russian authorities require.\" But Gill warned that demand for tickets would leave many fans disappointed: \"We could sell well over 100,000 tickets for this final, so there will be a lot of disappointed people.\" Both United and Chelsea have each received around 21,000 tickets for the match. But with officially allocated tickets expected to be snapped up by season ticket holders and loyalty scheme members, many more fans are expected to travel to Moscow independently. Flights from London to Moscow on the day of the match, returning the following day were available for around $1,600 over the internet on Thursday. But the British foreign office Web site advised Thursday that there were no hotel vacancies in Moscow and warned supporters that they would not be able to find a room on arrival. Meanwhile, UK sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe urged fans to be on their best behavior in Moscow, warning that trouble could derail England's bid to host the 2018 World Cup. \"I was really impressed and pleased that the European champions final will be an all-English final but that brings some responsibilities for the teams involved and their supporters,\" Sutcliffe told PA. \"It should be a great advert for the Premier League and for English football but it will also be the place everyone will be looking at if anything goes wrong. \"If that happened it would not only be damaging for the two teams participating but could also have a big impact on the reputation of our game at a time when we are trying to encourage football nations to support our World Cup bid.\" With the match due to kick off at 2245 local time, the British foreign office Web site advised supporters \"not to let alcohol spoil their Champions League final experience,\" pointing out that smoking and drinking in Red Square are illegal. \"The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is providing detailed information for those fans who are traveling,\" said minister for Europe Jim Murphy. \"So I encourage those who are going, to look at the specific travel advice on how to enjoy a trouble-free and successful visit to Moscow.\" E-mail to a friend .", "dfc606b97c43ac249d72cff2fe812213987a37a2": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A woman who helped raise a child with her female partner in Vermont before the pair split can visit the girl in Virginia even though that state doesn't recognize same-sex unions, a court ruled Friday. Janet Jenkins with Isabella, the daughter she helped raise with former partner Lisa Miller. Virginia's Supreme Court ruled that Janet Jenkins and Lisa Miller's civil union in 2000 gave Vermont, and its law on same-sex unions, jurisdiction over their subsequent custody and visitation disputes. Miller moved to Virginia with the child in 2003, and a Vermont court granted Jenkins visitation rights. But Miller took the case to a Virginia court, which ruled that Jenkins had no such rights there. The case was considered by legal experts to be the first conflict between two state courts over a major legal question arising from same-sex unions. Jenkins' attorney, Joseph Price of the Washington law firm Arent Fox, said Friday's ruling \"just affirms the old principle that when these kinds of custody and visitation disputes begin in one state, that's where they should remain.\" \"You can't shop them around to another state,\" Price said. \"Virginia really had no choice but to enforce judgments and judicial orders from Vermont.\" Vermont is one of the few states that allow same-sex partners to enter into a civil union. Two years after Vermont recognized Miller and Jenkins' relationship, Miller gave birth to a daughter, Isabella, conceived through artificial insemination. The relationship deteriorated, and Miller and the baby moved to Virginia. A Vermont court later granted Miller a dissolution of the civil union and granted custody of the child to her and visitation rights to Jenkins. Miller then asked the courts in Virginia -- which does not recognize same-sex unions or marriages -- to take jurisdiction of the dispute. A Virginia state judge eventually ruled that Jenkins had no \"parentage or visitation rights.\" The Virginia high court ruling Friday returned the case to Vermont's control, meaning Jenkins can visit the girl, who is now 6. Miller's attorney, Mathew Staver, said he was \"disappointed the state sidestepped the larger legal questions.\" \"This case shows that one state is not an island in the same-sex marriage dispute, and underscores having state laws that protect traditional one-man, one-woman marriages,\" said Staver, chairman of Liberty Counsel, a law firm that fights on behalf of what it calls \"traditional families.\" Miller said in 2005 that she was doing what was best for her daughter and was no longer a lesbian. \"I am Isabella's mom. I did conceive her; I birthed her,\" she said. \"I'm raising her. And in my opinion, Isabella needs to stay with me 100 percent of the time, because I am the only person that she identifies as a mom.\" Miller lives with Isabella in Winchester, Virginia. Jenkins did not offer an immediate reaction to the ruling but said in 2005 that she was only fighting for her rights as a parent. \"Justice will be served for Isabella,\" she said. \"I believe that. And I'll do whatever it takes. I'll be with her for as long as I can, or I'll be without her for as long as I have to, but I'm her mom. \"She's born here [in Vermont]. She's always here.\" Price said Jenkins, who lives in Fair Haven, Vermont, was supposed to visit Isabella last weekend, but Miller didn't appear with the girl. Friday's ruling comes a week after the California Supreme Court's refusal to delay its recent decision legalizing same-sex marriage in the state. Massachusetts also allows same-sex marriages; Vermont and three other states permit civil unions, and 12 other states give gay and lesbian couples some legal rights. Virginia amended its constitution in 2007 to decree that marriage is defined as a union between one man and one woman.", "087ac92e2ca469b5ca6277950e63b2f0706d0de2": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The top military and civilian leaders of the U.S. Air Force were forced out Thursday over the handling of nuclear weapons, the Defense Department secretary said. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Moseley, left, and Secretary Michael Wynne have stepped down. Chief of Staff Gen. T. Michael Moseley and Secretary Michael W. Wynne resigned over the department's concern over two incidents, including the August flight of a B-52 bomber that flew across the country with nuclear weapons. \"Focus of the Air Force leadership has drifted\" in terms of handling nuclear weapons and equipment, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said. In August, a B-52 bomber flew from North Dakota to Louisiana with the crew unaware that six nuclear-tipped missiles were on board. Four officers were relieved of duty afterward, including three colonels. Gates also cited this year's discovery that components designed to arm and fuse nuclear warheads were accidentally shipped to Taiwan in 2006.  Watch Gates talk about the firings \u00bb . Critics also cite last month's news that the Air Force's 5th Bomb Wing failed a defense \"nuclear surety\" inspection -- despite having months to prepare and being under close scrutiny after the previous incidents. The inspection found deficiencies in the wing's ability to protect its part of the nation's nuclear stockpile. The resignations come after a report on a Navy admiral's investigation that criticized the Air Force's reactions to the incidents. Gates said the report \"depicts a pattern of poor performance\" in which Air Force brass didn't act to improve security after mishaps and Air Force personnel handling nuclear weapons consistently failed to follow existing rules. Air Force leaders \"not only fell short in terms of specific acts, they failed to recognize systemic problems, to address those problems or, when beyond their authority to act, to call the attention of superiors to those problems,\" Gates said. The investigation found that although the Taiwan incident didn't compromise the integrity of the U.S. nuclear force, it represented \"a significant failure\" by the Air Force to ensure sensitive military components, Gates said. Gates said the report concluded that erosion in the branch's command and oversight standards helped lead to the incidents, and that they could have been prevented if the oversight programs had functioned correctly. He said he asked for the resignations after consulting President Bush. Sen. Carl Levin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Service committee, welcomed Gates' decision. \"Secretary Gates' focus on accountability is essential and had been absent from the office of the Secretary of Defense for too long,\" Levin said. \"The safety and security of America's nuclear weapons must receive the highest priority, just as it must in other countries.\" Rep. Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat and a senior member of the House Homeland Security Committee, also welcomed the resignations. Markey said he's long been concerned about what he called a series of dangerous Air Force missteps in handling nuclear weapons. \"The magnitude and frequency of these errors indicate a deep-seated problem within Air Force culture, practice and training,\" Markey said. \"The entire Department of Defense should immediately recommit itself to ensuring the safety and security of our nuclear stockpile before one of these mistakes has lethal consequences.\" A senior military source said the August nuclear weapons incident was the straw that broke the camel's back but that other leadership issues also factored into Moseley's and Wynne's resignations. A previous investigation into the B-52 flight uncovered a \"lackadaisical\" attention to detail in day-to-day operations at the air bases involved, an Air Force official said in October. Maj. Gen. Dick Newton, assistant deputy chief of staff for operations, said the investigation found \"a failure to follow procedures\" by \"a limited number of airmen\" at the two bases. Newton defended the procedures themselves. Wynne is not the first secretary of a military branch to resign since Gates became Defense secretary. In March 2007, Gates announced the resignation of Army Secretary Francis J. Harvey in the wake of reports of substandard conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington.

Serbian riot police stand in front of the damaged U.S. Embassy in Belgrade on Friday. The U.S. ambassador, Cameron Munter, is staying, officials said. The embassy was closed Friday, and a handful of riot police holding shields stood outside the building, its outer walls blackened from fires set the night before and some of its windows smashed. It will remain closed until Monday or Tuesday so officials can assess the damage, said Bill Wanlund, the embassy's spokesman. He said embassy staff were still in a heightened state of alert but there were no specific threats against any staff members. The United States has warned the Serbian government that it has a responsibility to protect its assets. A top U.S. diplomat was asked during an interview on CNN if the Serbian government \"gets\" the warning. \"They'd better get it, because they have a fundamental responsibility to protect our diplomats and our embassy and to protect American citizens,\" said Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs R. Nicholas Burns. \"What happened yesterday in Belgrade was absolutely reprehensible.\"  Watch Burns' angry comments on Belgrade attack \u00bb . Thursday's violence erupted after demonstrations by thousands of Serbs against Kosovo's declaration of independence. The anger directed against the United States and other countries for recognizing the breakaway province as a nation sparked attacks on Western embassies and shops by hundreds of people. Burns said there was an \"insufficient\" number of security people guarding the U.S. Embassy at a demonstration everyone knew would take place. He said security \"melted away\" as \"the mob attacked our embassy.\" \"This kind of thing should not happen in a civilized country. It doesn't happen in the United States of America. It doesn't happen in most world capitals. So the Serb government needs to reflect seriously about the responsibility it has under the Vienna Convention,\" he said. Burns, the third highest ranking diplomat in the State Department, said he told the Serbian prime minister, Vojislav Kostunica, and his government that the U.S. \"would hold them personally responsible for the safety of our people.\" \"They assured me that they would have adequate security on the ground today and for every day to come. We will hold them to that commitment,\" Burns said. Demonstrators only managed to break into one U.S. embassy building, which Wanlund said was rarely used by staff. He said the protesters didn't manage to get any documents or embassy materials. Only Marines and security guards were present at the embassy when the angry mob of about 100 approached the walls. In addition to the U.S. Embassy, the protesters attacked other Western interests including the embassies of Britain and Germany, as well as a McDonald's restaurant and a Nike shop. \"One might understand the emotion, but not the violence, and that's what the Serb government needs to remember,\" Burns said. Burns, who is stepping down in March, has long been involved in trying to resolve tensions in the former Yugoslavia. The situation was complicated by Sunday's unilateral declaration of independence by Serbia's predominantly Albanian region of Kosovo.  Kosovo is revered historically by Orthodox Christian Serbs but also is claimed as separate and distinct by its ethnic Muslim Albanians. The wisdom of recognizing Kosovo independence has been questioned by many observers, who say the United States won't recognize other unilateral declarations of independence. Some opponents of Kosovo's independence say recognition is a bad precedent if it's unilateral and not done in a bilateral, diplomatic setting. They say it will give others the incentive to stage their own breakaway nations. Burns said every situation has its unique set of circumstances, as does Kosovo, which was the victim of ethnic cleansing policies by the Slobodan Milosevic regime in 1999. NATO troops fought Serbia in an air war then and pushed Serbian forces out of the region. Since then Kosovo has been run by the United Nations and with security supplied by NATO forces.

He was killed September 4, 2006, by a stingray barb to the chest while filming an underwater documentary off Australia's northern coast. Joseph Krygier shot this photo of a memorial in August 2007 at the Australia Zoo in Beerwah, Australia. Irwin's death prompted a global outpouring of grief from fans, children and hundreds of early I-Report contributors, who shared photos, videos and memories with CNN shortly after he died. A year since, we asked CNN.com readers what they think his legacy will be, and how they are remembering him this year. Here is a selection of their responses: . Carol Shahan of Wilmington, Delaware In April, my Girl Scout Service Unit held an encampment. The event lasted Friday-Sunday and over 350 girls and leaders attended. Our theme was \"Crikey! Let's go camping -- a tribute to the conservation legacy of Steve Irwin.\" The girls learned about how they can help conserve their part of the world and contributed funds to the Wildlife Warriors through a coin drive. Patrick Rodrigue of Montreal, Quebec We met Steve and his wife and small entourage at an elephant safari park in Bali, Indonesia, in June 2004 during our honeymoon. We were having lunch when we saw him at the table next to us. He was on vacation and he still came over to our table to say \"Hello Mates!\" and pose for a picture. Helen Osada of Hong Kong I never get tired of watching Steve Irwin and his family on Animal Planet even though they are all reruns. He had real charisma unlike most other wildlife enthusiasts. And that he shared so much with us including his family says a lot about his generosity. His death was a great loss to us all. I really miss him. Melissa Amundsen Wells of Greensboro, North Carolina  Steve Irwin taught my daughter and myself that all animals deserve respect and protection, not just the furry cute ones. Every animal on the planet has a unique purpose and he conveyed that better than anyone else. His love for his work was a real inspiration to my whole family. We miss you Steve. Mirad Maglic of Sarajevo, Bosnia In my opinion, his unorthodox style, love for all things living and dedication to wildlife preservation made Steve a hero with a legacy that compares to what Elvis did for the rock music. I just hope that others will follow in his tracks, just as his wonderful daughter is doing. Donna Beckum of Orab, Ohio  It was a great honor to watch Bindi's show several times this past weekend. She is sure a chip off the ol' block! I will never forget Steve and his remarkable quest. I will continue to watch Bindi and all of the \"Crocodile Hunter\" episodes that are rerun. You just never get tired of watching them. I pray that God blesses Terri and her children and that Bindi continues to carry on where her daddy left off. Steve Irwin was an icon and certainly made a difference. He will never be forgotten! John Hock of Alpharetta, Georgia  Met him in March of '06. He was on his motorbike in the zoo with his son on the front of the bike. He had is hat and sunglasses on. We were over by the camels. I yelled \"Steve ...\" He said \"G'Day\" to me. Then he was off to the pens behind the crocoseum. Even that brief meeting had an effect on me. To meet someone larger than life is an honor. Michael Yang of Singapore Steve and Terri have been a big part of my life. I can't believe a year has flown by so fast. I was very sad at the misfortune of a stingray barb directly in Steve's heart. Without a doubt, Steve has helped make the world a better place both for people and animals. Jenna Barnaby of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania  ... I can't believe it's only been a year. I was so sad when he died and so upset about the unfairness of it all that it feels like he's been gone so much longer. I miss him and think I always will. Denise Cole of Union Lake, Michigan  The one and only time I saw Steve Irwin on television my thoughts were \"You can't do that to wildlife and not get killed.\" I was not surprised by his death at all. I am sorry that his wife is a widow and his children are without a father. They are obviously doing OK though and that is GOOD. Kim DiBiase of Fort Myers, Florida  My children now ages 9 & 11 grew up with Steve. My son who is 11 is a know-it-all with anything that has to do with animals due to his love of watching Steve since he was 4 years old. He knows every single type of snake and where they live. Steve's show was one of the few children's shows I could watch with the kids over and over. We miss him more than you could know and feel for his family. Only the good die young. Patrick L. of Montreal, Quebec Steve Irwin will be remembered for his courage in dealing with dangerous animals, his skill as an entertainer and his humanity. Few people take the risks Steve did in dealing with dangerous animals; even fewer manage to do this type of job with the flair and heart that was visible from watching Steve at work. Steve was one of a kind and he will be missed. Tim Pope of Cumming, Georgia  The man was reckless and a bad example for kids. He went out of his way to dramatize his product by courting danger and taking chances. Hopefully, the way he died will keep more intelligent kids from thinking that jumping on a crocodile's back is a great sport. I don't say this to detract from or denigrate him, but his installation in the heroes' pantheon sends a bad message. Sakthivel Subramanian of Frankfurt, Germany I remember him as brave man with a kind heart for animals (reptiles) with which he lived his lifetime! I'm praying to God for his soul to rest in peace. Liz Cook of Plainville, Massachusetts  One of our first \"encounters\" with Steve Irwin was through a Wiggles video that my children own. He had such an unusually bright spirit. We watched a special last night that included his trip to Belize and it was amazing to see how he fired my children's imagination and enthusiasm for the animals he encountered on his trip! They could not believe he didn't take it personally when he was injured by the iguana he was chasing! He is one of those rare souls that make it almost impossible to believe he is really gone ... so vivid, so warm, so BIG in spirit. Our best to his family on this sad anniversary. Jason Epperson of York, Pennsylvania Editor's note: Epperson sent a poem tribute to Irwin. The first letters of the lines spell out \"Steve Irwin.\" South Australia I was born, Trekked my camera thru brush and thorn! Endangered species I adore, Venomous and fanged all the more! Earned my fair share of smiles, In wrestling snakes and crocodiles! Ray of nature pierced my heart, Was chosen then to depart!

The woman involved -- Mandi Hamlin -- told reporters earlier Friday she was humiliated by last month's incident, in which she was forced to painfully remove the piercings behind a curtain as she heard snickers from male TSA officers nearby. The incident occurred at the Lubbock, Texas, airport. The officers \"rightly insisted that the alarm that was raised be resolved,\" the TSA said in a statement posted on its Web site Friday afternoon. \"TSA supports the thoroughness of the officers involved as they were acting to protect the passengers and crews of the flights departing Lubbock that day.\" However, \"TSA has reviewed the procedures themselves and agrees that they need to be changed,\" the statement said. \"In the future, TSA will inform passengers that they have the option to resolve the alarm through a visual inspection of the article in lieu of removing the item in question.\" Hamlin and her lawyer, celebrity attorney Gloria Allred, said they want a public apology from the agency, as well as a guarantee that future passengers with piercings will be treated with dignity and respect. Allred pointed out that TSA's Web site says passengers with piercings can undergo a pat-down inspection if they do not want to take their piercings out -- an option she said Hamlin was never offered. \"The conduct of TSA was cruel and unnecessary,\" Allred told reporters at a news conference. \"Last time that I checked, a nipple was not a dangerous weapon.\" She said if an apology was not forthcoming, \"Mandi is going to have to consider her legal options.\" Attempts by CNN to reach Allred for a response to the TSA statement Friday afternoon were unsuccessful. TSA said in its statement it acknowledges \"that our procedures caused difficulty for the passenger involved and regrets (the) situation in which she found herself. We appreciate her raising awareness on this issue and we are changing the procedures to ensure that this does not happen again.\" The incident occurred February 24 as Hamlin, 37, was preparing to fly to Dallas-Fort Worth from Lubbock, where she had been visiting her elderly great-uncle. Hamlin said she also has navel and ear piercings and has never set off a metal detector or been singled out for additional screening at an airport. She did not set off the metal detector at Lubbock International Airport, but was pulled to the side for additional screening, Allred said. A hand wand used by a TSA officer beeped when it was waved over her breasts. Hamlin told the officer she had nipple piercings, Allred said, and that officer called over another officer, who told her she would need to remove them. \"Ms. Hamlin did not want to remove her nipple piercings,\" Allred said, reading from a letter she sent TSA. \"After nipple rings are inserted, the skin can often heal around the piercing and the rings can be extremely difficult and painful to remove. In addition, once removed, the pierced skin may close up almost immediately, making it difficult and painful to reinsert the piercing.\" More officers were called over, and the group grew to four male and two female TSA officers, according to Hamlin. Also, a small crowd of onlookers had started to gather. The officers insisted that Hamlin remove the nipple rings, Allred said. \"She felt humiliated by the scene that the TSA officers were making,\" Allred said. \"With tears streaming down her face, she again asked to show the piercings to a TSA officer instead of having to remove them. She was told, however, she would not be allowed to fly unless she removed them. Had she been told that she had a right to a pat-down, she would have chosen that option.\" She eventually was taken to a private area behind a curtain to remove the piercings, Allred said. One came out easily, but the other would not, and she called to an officer that she was having trouble and would need pliers. She was handed a large pair, Allred said. \"As Ms. Hamlin struggled to remove the piercing, behind the curtain she could hear a growing number of predominately male TSA officers snickering in the background,\" Allred said in the letter. \"Mandi Hamlin was publicly humiliated. ... Clearly, this is not how passengers should be treated.\"  Watch the passenger demonstrate removing the jewelry \u00bb . Afterward, Hamlin underwent another scan, but realized she had forgotten to remove her navel ring. She offered to remove it, Allred said, but an officer told her it was not necessary because he could see it. Hamlin wondered why a similar visual inspection of her nipple rings would not have sufficed, Allred said. \"I wouldn't wish this experience upon anyone,\" Hamlin told reporters. \"I felt surprised, embarrassed, humiliated and scared. No one deserves to go through this.\" In a statement earlier Friday, the TSA said it \"is well aware of terrorists' interest in hiding dangerous items in sensitive areas of the body. Therefore, we have a duty to the American public to resolve any alarm that we discover.\" TSA included in its statement a picture of a prototype training device it will use to simulate a \"bra bomb\" in training and testing its officers. Hamlin said she had to visit the person who originally pierced her nipples to get the rings reinserted, and said the process was excruciatingly painful because of the scar tissue that had formed. \"People who are pierced should not be snickered at, should not become the object of ridicule, should not be singled out for special and uneven and unequal treatment,\" Allred said. \"They should be respected just like everybody else.\" She said she had received a call from TSA's public affairs office Friday morning. \"We hope that means they're going to jump on this and do something about it,\" she said. \"We want TSA to do the right thing now. We're going to give them the opportunity.\" Hamlin said she will continue to fly but will avoid the Lubbock airport. The next time she visits her great-uncle, she said, \"I will be driving.\" E-mail to a friend .

In effect, Adam Air will not be allowed to operate any airplanes effective 12 a.m. Wednesday, 18 March 2008,\" according to a statement from Indonesia's civil aviation chief, Budhi Muliawan Suyitno. A year ago, a Garuda Airlines plane overshot the runway in Jakarta, careened into a rice patty field and burst into flames, killing more than 20 people on board. On January 1, 2007, Adam Air Flight 574 crashed, killing all 102 people on board. A day after the crash, there were reports that 12 survivors had been found. But those 12 survivors, it turned out later, were from an Indonesian ferry that sank four days earlier. For more than a week after the Adam Air flight disappeared off the radar screens, Indonesian authorities scoured the mountainous terrain of western Sulawesi province and the Java Sea for any sign of the missing aircraft, but found nothing. The suspension will last for three months, according to Bambang Ervan, a spokesman for Indonesia's Air Transport Directorate. Adam Air's permit was revoked because it \"failed to implement quality standards for its aircraft, including pilot training and supervision in accordance with standard operational procedures,\" Ervan said. The directorate sent a letter to Adam Air regarding its decision, but has not received a reply. Adam Air CEO Adam Suherman told CNN the airline is not surprised by the Air Transport Office's announcement. He said the airline had to suspend its operations Tuesday morning because one of its main investors pulled out, causing the airliner financial problems. Indonesia's aviation authorities recently issued a report outlining a road map to safety, acknowledging that their track record on safety is unacceptable.

Clarke, whose science fiction and non-fiction works ranged from the script for \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" to an early proposal for communications satellites, has died at age 90, associates have said. Visionary author Arthur C. Clarke had fans around the world. Clarke had been wheelchair-bound for several years with complications stemming from a youthful bout with polio and had suffered from back trouble recently, said Scott Chase, the secretary of the nonprofit Arthur C. Clarke Foundation. He died early Wednesday -- Tuesday afternoon ET -- at a hospital in Colombo, Sri Lanka, where he had lived since the 1950s, Chase said. \"He had been taken to hospital in what we had hoped was one of the slings and arrows of being 90, but in this case it was his final visit,\" he said. In a videotaped 90th birthday message to fans, Clarke said he still hoped to see some sign of intelligent life beyond Earth, more work on alternatives to fossil fuels -- and \"closer to home,\" an end to the 25-year civil war in Sri Lanka between the government and ethnic Tamil separatists. \"I dearly wish to see lasting peace established in Sri Lanka as soon as possible,\" he said. \"But I'm aware that peace cannot just be wished -- it requires a great deal of hard work, courage and persistence.\" Clarke and director Stanley Kubrick shared an Academy Award nomination for best adapted screenplay for \"2001.\" The film grew out of Clarke's 1951 short story, \"The Sentinel,\" about an alien transmitter left on the moon that ceases broadcasting when humans arrive. As a Royal Air Force officer during World War II, Clarke took part in the early development of radar. In a paper written for the radio journal \"Wireless World\" in 1945, he suggested that artificial satellites hovering in a fixed spot above Earth could be used to relay telecommunications signals across the globe. He is widely credited with introducing the idea of the communications satellite, the first of which were launched in the early 1960s. But he never patented the idea, prompting a 1965 essay that he subtitled, \"How I Lost a Billion Dollars in My Spare Time.\" His best-known works, such as \"2001\" or the 1953 novel \"Childhood's End,\" combined the hard science he learned studying physics and mathematics with insights into how future discoveries would change humanity. David Eicher, editor of Astronomy magazine, told CNN that Clarke's writings were influential in shaping public interest in space exploration during the 1950s and '60s.  Watch how Clarke stands among sci-fi giants \u00bb . \"He was very interested in technology and also in humanity's history and what lay out in the cosmos,\" Eicher said. His works combined those \"big-picture\" themes with \"compelling stories that were more interesting and more complex than other science fiction writers were doing,\" he said. Tedson Meyers, the chairman of the Clarke Foundation, said the organization is now dedicated to reproducing the combination of imagination and knowledge that he credited the author with inspiring. \"The question for us is, how does human imagination bring about such talent on both sides of the brain?\" he asked. \"How do you find the next Arthur Clarke?\" Clarke was knighted in 1998.

The trial of Tariq Aziz, pictured here in a Baghdad courtroom in July 2004, has begun. The trial, which is to resume May 20, was delayed because one of the defendants, Ali Hassan al-Majeed, also known as \"Chemical Ali,\" was not present because he was ill. Iraqi procedural codes require that all defendants be in court for the first session. Chief Judge Raouf Abdul Rahman read a U.S. medical report signed by three doctors that said al-Majeed is in critical condition after suffering a heart attack two weeks ago. He has been released from the hospital but still requires daily treatment and doctor visits. The report said that traveling to court from his detention facility could worsen his health. He cannot walk up stairs or sit in court for long hours, it said. He will need three weeks to recover and may need some sort of surgery, the report said. It added he is diabetic and suffers from \"acute heart failure.\" Treatment includes clearing of the arteries followed by either open heart surgery or stents in the arteries, but neither option is available at this time, the report said. Ali Hasan al-Majeed, who was a top Baathist official during the Saddam Hussein era, is awaiting execution after being convicted of genocide in connection with the killing of Kurds during the Anfal campaign in the late 1980s. Aziz, al-Majeed and six others are now facing trial for having a role in the execution of 42 Iraqi merchants in 1992. A former deputy prime minister, Aziz was the first to be called into court, followed by six other defendants. Aziz appeared frail, walked slowly with a cane, and was coughing and blowing his nose. He was sitting in the seat Saddam Hussein used during his appearances in court and was represented by a private attorney. The court was sorting out which defendants did not have attorneys present. This is the fourth major trial of former Hussein regime officials since his government was overthrown. The most prominent was the 2006 trial that led to the execution of Hussein and three lieutenants for a crackdown in the Shiite town of Dujail in which more than 140 men allegedly plotting Hussein's assassination were executed. Aziz's lead attorney, Badie Aref -- who was an attorney for Hussein in that trial -- is charged with contempt of court in Iraq and has been in Jordan since a warrant for his arrest was issued last year. He said he would return to Baghdad for this trial only if he were assured he would not be arrested. Meanwhile, amid a swirling, blanketing sandstorm, fierce fighting in Baghdad Tuesday saw U.S. troops kill 32 \"enemy forces\" in a gunbattle, according to the U.S. military. Iraqi authorities reported 16 people were killed in a residential area in the same clash. The Iraqi Interior Ministry said the fighting was in the predominantly Shiite Sadr City neighborhood in eastern Baghdad. Five suspected insurgents dressed in Iraqi army uniforms attacked the home of a human rights worker in Diyala on Tuesday, killing the resident of the home and an Iraqi soldier who lived in the neighborhood, according to the U.S. military. Two Iraqi civilians also were injured in the small-arms attack. \"Attacking civilians in their homes is both criminal and barbaric,\" said Major Peggy Kageleiry, spokeswoman for the military's Multi-National Division - North. Insurgents have been attempting to exploit the harsh conditions, which have curtailed flights coming into Baghdad International Airport. Sandstorms make it easier for militants to screen their activities and harder for U.S. air power to be deployed effectively. A U.S. military spokesman said fighting began around 9:30 a.m. when militants fired at a U.S. patrol and wounded an American soldier. When the soldier was being evacuated, a U.S. vehicle was struck by two roadside bombs and peppered with small-arms fire and rocket propelled grenades. That left two more soldiers injured. Three more soldiers were wounded in the fighting. Soldiers used a \"combination of weapon systems available, including a guided multiple launch rocket (GMLR) system\" to fight the insurgents and killed at least 28 militants in a four-hour long battle, the military said. Lt. Col. Steven Stover, spokesman for Multi-National Division-Baghdad, said three GMLRs were launched, at 11:23 a.m., 1:03 p.m. and 1:37 p.m. Officials with Iraq's Interior and Health Ministry told CNN 16 people were killed and 45 people were wounded when U.S. rockets hit at least three houses in a residential area in Sadr City around 1:15 p.m. Two children and a woman were among the dead and four children and five women were among the wounded, they said. Asked if he was aware of reports of civilian casualties from the strikes, Stover said, \"If there were civilian casualties, I sincerely regret them. \"The rockets struck militants firing from buildings, alleyways and rooftops. It was these militants who initiated the engagement by attacking U.S. soldiers. Our soldiers have a right to defend ourselves.\" Two U.S. soldiers were killed Tuesday in separate incidents in northwest Baghdad, the military said. The first soldier died from wounds suffered from insurgent small-arms fire at about 8:50 p.m. local time in northwest Baghdad, according to a U.S. military public affairs office. The second soldier died at about 10:15 p.m. when the vehicle he was riding in was struck by an improvised explosive device. The names of both soldiers were being withheld until their families could be notified. E-mail to a friend .

The tickets carried a hefty price tag -- up to $9,000 roundtrip from New York to London -- but the luxuries were aimed toward more discriminating business travelers. The privately-held airline, in a news release Sunday, said it had secured additional financing. But \"some issues arose that prevented the parties from moving forward,\" it said. The airline immediately began the process of eliminating the positions of most of its employees. \"There are times in business when even though you execute your business plan and even though your employees do their jobs beautifully, external forces prevent you from controlling your own destiny,\" Eos CEO Jack Williams said in a statement. The airline becomes the latest in a number of small carriers that have gone out of business in recent month. Analysts blame the high cost of fuel, a slowing economy and a credit crunch. Other carriers that have declared bankruptcy recently include Skybus and ATA airlines.

Josef Fritzl admitted to authorities he raped his daughter and fathered her children. Investigators believe Fritzl planned to build the cellar as early as 1978, shortly after, according to his daughter, he began raping her at age 11 or 12, said police spokesman Franz Polzer. The 73-year-old Austrian began building the dungeon as part of an addition to his home that year, and simply added the hidden space -- which was not recorded in any building plans -- Polzer said. It took Fritzl until 1983 to finish the addition, Polzer said. Investigators recently discovered another door to the dungeon prison, which was blocked by a 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) steel and concrete door that Fritzl probably stopped using when he later constructed an electronic door for a second entrance, Polzer said. Fritzl, who police believe was the only one with access to the cellar, had to travel through an elaborate maze to get to the prison. \"You would have to open up a total of eight doors, and ... (for the) last door which would go into this space (where the family was imprisoned), you would also have to use electronic opening apparatus,\" Polzer said. \"We will have to find out perhaps later from now if perhaps there are other spaces we haven't discovered yet, and perhaps maybe there is something else interesting.\" Fritzl was recently arrested and confessed to holding his daughter, Elisabeth, captive in the dungeon under the Fritzl home for decades, repeatedly raping her and fathering seven children -- six of whom survived. Three of the children were adopted by Josef Fritzl and his wife after he concocted the ruse that Elisabeth had left the babies on their doorstep. The story of the family's imprisonment began to unravel more than two weeks ago, when one of the children still in the dungeon, 19-year-old Kerstin Fritzl, fell seriously ill with convulsions. The father agreed to take her to a hospital, the first time she was allowed out of the prison where she had spent her entire life with her mother and two brothers. Dr. Albert Reiter, who is treating Kerstin, said Monday that while her condition is still \"grave,\" it \"has improved somewhat.\" \"She has become more stable, but despite that we have to continue to keep her under sedation and give her respiratory help,\" Reiter said, noting it is not clear how long she will be kept under sedation. Elisabeth and her two sons were reunited with her mother, Rosemarie, who police say knew nothing about the basement prison. They were also reunited with the three children that Josef had taken from Elisabeth. The reunited family is living in secluded quarters at a psychiatric clinic, where they are finding a daily routine and adjusting to sunlight -- something the two boys had never seen -- according to the clinic's chief doctor. \"The mother and the smallest child have, in just the last couple of days, increased their sensitivity to light,\" Dr. Berthold Kepplinger said. \"So we have been able to equip them with protective sunglasses.\" Five-year-old Felix is \"getting more and more lively,\" Kepplinger said. \"He's fascinated by everything that he sees around him -- the fresh air, the light, and the food -- all of these things are helping them,\" he said. \"Slowly the color of their skin is changing back to a more normal (shade).\" He also said the family members are still getting to know each other and live together as a family. Kepplinger praised Elisabeth for having provided a daily living routine for her children during their captivity. He said the family is getting into a new routine in which the mother and the grandmother make breakfast for the family, and the children make their beds. However, he said there is a noticeable difference between the pace of life of the children held in captivity and that of those who grew up in Fritzl's home. He said the mother, Elisabeth, takes breaks and naps several times a day. The health of the family members is satisfactory and hospital staff have been able to let more and more light into the rooms where the family is staying, Kepplinger said. Kepplinger said the children, after being confined to a small space their entire lives, are finding it increasingly easy to be in larger spaces. Initially the dungeon where Fritzl held his daughter was only 35 square meters. In 1993, around the time Elisabeth was pregnant with her fourth child, Fritzl decided to add to the dungeon, building another room that increased the entire living space of the family to about 55 square meters. On Wednesday or Thursday, prosecution authorities will attempt to question Fritzl -- who is no longer talking to police following his initial confession, state prosecutor Gerhard Sedlacek said. A warden at the St. Poelten jail, where Fritzl is being held, told CNN that Fritzl appears to be doing well, but he is refusing to go on walks outside the building where he is detained.

He arrived to find the woman tied to a tree, her hair partially cut and her complexion ruddy from being slapped. She had no serious injuries. \"I was appalled at what I saw because people should be more socially responsible than to do this,\" Tiwari said. Authorities arrested six people, including the man who admitted to hiring her services as a witch. They were due to appear before a magistrate on Friday.

When his wife's condition deteriorated, Ayodhya accused her of performing black magic, Tiwari said, and a crowd soon gathered and tied her to the tree.

Tiwari said he was disturbed by the fact that a journalist filmed the incident before contacting authorities. \"The media filmed the incident, then called the police -- instead of the police first,\" Tiwari said.

Emmanuel Pogagtetz, left, fouls Croatia striker Ivica Olic to concede the match-winning penalty. The Croatians took the lead in the fourth minute when midfielder Luka Modric coolly slotted home from the penalty spot after Emmanuel Pogatetz clumsily body-checked striker Ivica Olic in the area. Slaven Bilic's team dominated the first half, and should have gone further ahead in the 35th minute but Olic's strike partner Mladen Petric blazed over the bar with a left-foot volley after beating the offside trap to run on to Vedran Corluka's cross. Austria's main threat had come from set-pieces, but they were not able to capitalize on a string of corners. However, the home players kept battling in the second half and squandered a series of chances to level the score in the final 15 minutes. Martin Harnik fired over the bar on 78 as Croatia scrambled to clear the danger, then substitute Ivica Vastic had a powerful header well saved by goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa, who then kept out another low effort by the veteran midfielder. Pletikosa also had to deny a driven shot from Umit Korkmaz, who also came off the bench, while another substitute in Roman Kienast flicked a header just wide from a free kick in the third minute of time added on. Croatia went into the tournament as one of the outside bets, having qualified top of their group ahead of Russia with a victory away to England which eliminated the British team. However, their chances of success were dealt a massive blow when top scorer Eduardo da Silva was ruled out of the tournament due to a broken leg. None of Croatia's strikers managed to score in the warmup matches, and the Arsenal forward's goal-poaching ability was sorely missed on Sunday. The winning goal came after Modric and Olic combined down the left wing from a throw-in, and Pogatetz clearly impeded the striker well away from the Austria goal. The Middlesbrough defender was booked for protesting the referee's decision, but he could have no complaints with the ruling. Austria are the lowest-ranked of the 16 teams at the tournament in 92nd place, but showed great courage against a 15th-seeded Croatia side stacked with attacking talent. But they joined fellow co-hosts Switzerland in losing their opening match, following the Czech Republic's 1-0 victory on Saturday. Croatia next play Germany on Thursday, when Austria take on Poland. Coach Bilic was delighted to start with a victory, but was not so impressed with his team's performance. \"Some players were overwhelmed by playing at a great tournament but we started off with the best possible way -- with a win,\" Bilic told reporters. \"In the first 35 minutes we played excellently, of course the early lead contributed to that. \"They exerted more pressure in the second half and I'm sure that is not to do with a lack of strength from our players. But we confined ourselves to our penalty area too early. \"The last 15 minutes or so when they play all or nothing, you can do that -- but we started in the 60th minute or so. I didn't think the players were happy when they got back in the dressing room. I turned on the CD player and said they should sing because they won.\" Austria coach Josef Hickersberger was left frustrated by his side's failure to take their chances. \"This was the worst possible start you can have in an opening match of a major tournament,\" he said. \"We took some time to recover, during the first 30 minutes we were nervous. \"For the rest of the match we were playing the way we should have been playing. We even dominated in the second half of the match. We had good opportunities but unfortunately we weren't able to score a goal, so we are empty-handed.

Viktor Bout is accused of selling missiles, rockets and other weapons to FARC, a Colombian rebel group. Viktor Bout, who was recently captured in Thailand, had agreed to sell the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) surface-to-air missiles, armor-piercing rocket launchers, \"ultralight\" airplanes, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other weapons, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a news release. There was no immediate public response from Bout, who remains in custody in Thailand.

FARC is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department. Justice Department officials said they are seeking Bout's extradition to the United States.

Last month Judge Steven Millsteed banned the couple from having sex with each other, but released them on a three-year, $460 good behavior bond. Court transcripts also revealed their first child died in 2001 from a congenital heart disorder. The couple told 60 Minutes that they fell in love in 2000 when they \"discovered each other later in life.\" Deaves had left the family home when Jenny was a baby, and did not see her again for 30 years. What do you think of the couple's relationship? However, the Age reported Deaves' former wife, Dorothy, disputed their claim that they were virtual strangers when they fell in love. \"They were in contact all the time,\" she said. \"His youngest daughter [from his second marriage] didn't even know they were together and she is really traumatized -- she is hurting terrible.\" Deaves' first wife and Jennifer's mother, Joan, said children deserved a better chance in life than one that originated from incest.

Turkish troops patrol near the border with Iraq during the February offensive. Jabbar Yawer, spokesman for Iraq's Kurdish Regional Government security forces, said at least 16 rounds were fired on Dashti Barzji -- an uninhabited area in Iraq's Irbil province located about 12 miles from Iraq's border. Irbil is one of the three provinces compromising Iraq's Kurdish region. The Turkish military in Ankara had no immediate comment about the report. Yawer said Turkish helicopters were seen in the area during the strike but said that the choppers were not involved in the attack. The border conflict has wider implications for the Middle East and Asia, with the United States concerned that prolonged cross-border fighting would serve to destabilize the region, where Kurdish separatists pose challenges to power in Iran and Syria, as well as  Turkey \u00bb and  Iraq \u00bb. The Turkish military for months has been conducting cross-border airstrikes and artillery fire in northern Iraq against members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK -- militants who have been launching attacks against Turkey from bases in northern Iraq. Turkish troops launched a ground offensive on the evening of Feb. 21 \"to prevent the region from being used as a safe haven by the terrorists and to contribute to the internal peace and stability of Iraq in the long run.\" It was the first significant Turkish ground offensive into Iraq since the 2003 overthrow of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, and it ended after Iraqi and U.S. officials urged Turkey to make the foray as brief as possible. A total of 240 rebels, 24 troops, and three village guards were killed, the Turkish military said. The PKK has spent two decades fighting for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey, with some of its attacks launched from inside northern Iraq. Turks regard the PKK militants as terrorists and point to indiscriminate PKK attacks against civilians as well as police and military targets over the years. The United States and the European Union also label the PKK a terrorist organization. U.S. officials have shared intelligence with Turkey. The Iraqi government opposes the PKK presence, but it views the Turkish military incursion as a violation of its sovereignty. E-mail to a friend .

He was deployed 10 weeks ago and his fellow soldiers were sworn to secrecy. \"At the end of the day I like to sort of be a normal person, and for once I think this is about as normal as I'm ever going to get,\" the 23-year-old prince said in a recent interview. Harry is third in line to the British throne and serves with the Blues and Royals. The information had been kept secret for security reasons, said Gen. Richard Dannatt, the chief of Britain's General Staff. Because of the unique circumstances of the deployment. CNN, as well as other news organizations, chose to honor an embargo requested by the military. The prince is a member of a group called Joint Tactical Air Control, or JTAC. He holds the rank of cornet -- equivalent to a second lieutenant -- and serves as a forward air controller. Watch Prince Harry on the front lines in Afghanistan \u00bb . His duties include calling in airstrikes and air support when necessary, guaranteeing the accuracy of bombing on the ground and guarding against incidents of friendly fire. \"As far as I'm concerned, I'm out here as a normal JTAC on the ground and not as Prince Harry,\" he said. Harry is the younger son of Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, and the late Princess Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997. The military confirmed his assignment after a U.S. Web site broke the news blackout -- and Dannatt expressed displeasure at the report. Watch how a top secret operation deployed Prince Harry \u00bb . \"I am very disappointed that foreign Web sites have decided to run this story without consulting us,\" Dannatt said in a written statement. \"It was my judgment that with an understanding with the media not to broadcast his whereabouts, the risk in (deploying him to Afghanistan) was manageable. \"Now that the story is in the public domain, the Chief of Defence Staff and I will take advice from the operational commanders about whether his deployment can continue.\" Last year, the military ruled Harry could not be sent to Iraq because publicity about the deployment could put him and his unit at risk. But Dannatt said the experience has demonstrated \"that it is perfectly possible for Prince Harry to be employed just the same as other Army officers of his rank and experience.\" \"His conduct on operations in Afghanistan has been exemplary,\" the general said. \"He has been fully involved in operations and has run the same risks as everyone else in his battle group. In common with all of his generation in the army today, he is a credit to the nation.\"  Watch Prince Harry on the front lines \u00bb . Shortly after the news of the prince's deployment broke, several Islamist Web sites posted messages alerting their \"brethren\" in Afghanistan to be on the lookout for the royal soldier. \"O brothers of monotheism, if you find anyone with unusual security in his battalion, know that this could be the Prince Harry. We ask God that he gets caught on your hands,\" one such posting read. Several members of the British royal family have seen combat over the past century. Harry's grandfather, Prince Phillip, served aboard warships in World War II; his great-grandfather -- King George VI -- took part in the World War I naval battle of Jutland; and Prince Andrew, Harry's uncle, flew Navy helicopters during Britain's 1982 war with Argentina over the Falkand Islands. Harry's brother, Prince William, is also an army officer. But as second in line for the throne, he is specifically barred from combat. The last sitting British monarch to lead troops in battle was George II, who defeated a French force at the Battle of Dettingen in 1743.

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, left, greets Iraq's Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Sunday. \"Iraq today doesn't present any threat as it used to be in the times of the former regime,\" al-Maliki told Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during a Sunday meeting between two leaders, according to a statement from the prime minister's office. \"Today's Iraq is a constitutional state based on the rule of law, and it seeks to develop its relations with the regional countries based on cooperation and mutual respect,\" al-Maliki said. Earlier, Iran's state-run news agency IRNA quoted the Iraqi leader as saying that \"Baghdad would not allow its soil to be used as a base to damage the security of the neighboring countries, including Iran.\" His remarks come as the United States and Iraq are trying to reach a bilateral agreement on how long the U.S. military will remain in Iraq and what role it will play in Iraq's security. But al-Maliki media adviser Ali Hadi said negotiations between Iraq and the United States are in their \"very early stages\" and were not part of Sunday's talks.  Watch Ahmadinejad and al-Maliki sit down for talks \u00bb . \"The treaty is purely an Iraqi-American treaty. The Iranians have nothing to do with it,\" Hadi said. \"We will not discuss the progress or the key elements of agreements or disagreements with them because this is an Iraqi issue.\" The proposed U.S.-Iraqi pact has triggered street protests in Iraq, where many suspect the deal could lead to the establishment of permanent American bases, a long-term presence of U.S. troops and a weakening of Iraqi government control over those troops. Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, whose militia was the target of a U.S.-backed Iraqi clampdown in Basra and Baghdad recently, has called for weekly protests against the agreement. Al-Maliki and Ahmadinejad met Sunday afternoon, with Ahmadinejad calling on Iraq's neighbors and the United Nations to help restore security and stability to Iraq, IRNA reported. And al-Maliki thanked Ahmadinejad for his call for an end to longstanding U.N. sanctions against Iraq that date back to the 1991 Persian Gulf war. Iran has long called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, which the United States invaded in 2003. Meanwhile, the United States has accused Iran of arming and training \"criminal\" Shiite militias in Iraq and of seeking to develop nuclear weapons, allegations the Iranians deny. It is al-Maliki's third visit to Iran since he became prime minister more than two years ago. The two countries, which are neighbors, both have Shiite Muslim majorities, and al-Maliki's ruling coalition is dominated by Shiite religious parties long backed by Iran. Adnan Pachachi, a leading Sunni Arab member of Iraq's parliament, told CNN he wanted al-Maliki to call on Iran to stop supporting armed factions in Iraq. \"I think this has to stop,\" Pachachi told CNN. \"I hope that Mr. Maliki will make it absolutely clear that Iraqis of all parties, of all sectarian origins and ethnic origins, are strongly opposed to Iran's attempt to interfere in Iraq's affairs.\" Pachachi, a former foreign minister, said al-Maliki's predecessor, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, allowed Iraq's security forces to be dominated by sectarian and ethnic militias, and that U.S. troops should remain until those influences are weeded out. \"In the long run, it is in the interest of the United States to have a secure Iraq and armed forces and security forces of Iraq with undivided loyalty and allegiance to the state and not influenced by sectarian affiliations or party loyalties,\" he said.", "914a0163e25ecccb635b601837cc4dd552c66ce0": "ORLANDO, Florida (CNN)  -- The man accused of trying to sneak bomb-making materials on a flight from Orlando to Jamaica admitted he planned to build a bomb after he landed, according to an FBI agent. Witnesses say the man arrested Tuesday was \"rocking left and right and up and down.\" The man said he planned to \"detonate the device on a tree stump in Jamaica, but later told us he was going to show friends how to build explosive devices like the kind he saw in Iraq,\" FBI agent Kelly Boaz said in a court affidavit. The first court appearance for the man, Kevin Brown, was postponed Wednesday to allow government officials time to look into whether he suffers from mental illness. U.S. Army officials said Brown was in the service from September 1999 through December 2003, when he received an honorable discharge. Although his record did not show a deployment to Iraq, he received an Army commendation medal in 2003 for serving in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, officials said. His court-appointed attorney declined to comment. Brown, a Jamaican national, was arrested Tuesday on charges of \"carrying a weapon or explosive on an aircraft,\" the FBI said. He was taken into custody after an air safety officer noticed him acting strangely as he waited to board an Air Jamaica flight, federal authorities said. He appeared in court Wednesday but government officials asked for the delay, saying there were indications Brown might have a history of mental illness. A new hearing is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. Thursday. Transportation Safety Administration officials said a \"behavior identification officer\" noticed Brown acting strangely around noon Tuesday as he approached a ticket counter. Officials said Brown, who is believed to be in his early 30s, had checked baggage that contained two galvanized pipes, end caps, two containers of BBs, batteries, glass bottles containing nitromethane, a laptop, bomb-making literature and one model rocket igniter. Boaz, a member of law enforcement bomb squad, said the items could have been used to make bomb. \"The items found in Brown's baggage constitute an incendiary device,\" Boaz said in court papers. \"The nitromethane was in a breakable container and the model rocket igniter would act as the wick.\" Initial record checks indicate Brown was in the United States legally, the FBI said. According to the bureau, he was living on the streets in Orlando, \"sleeping in the open.\" Federal investigators said he seems to have been living in several places, sometimes with relatives, and they don't know his home town. \"It appears to be an isolated incident, but our investigation is continuing,\" the FBI's David Couvertier told CNN. As part of the probe, officials are looking at whether Brown has ties to any organized group, he said. The FBI is being aided by Orlando police. Airport officials said several ticket counters were temporarily closed during the incident, and 11 flights were delayed. Airport spokeswoman Carolyn Fennell said Air Jamaica, Air Canada, West Jet and Frontier flights were among those delayed. E-mail to a friend .

NBA stars such as Kobe Bryant may soon be seen on a regular basis in Europe. The astonishing claims come hard on the heels of plans by the football's English Premier League to play matches overseas and underline the growing trend of globalization in major sports leagues. This was further evidenced by Super Bowl champions New York Giants playing a regular NFL season game against the Miami Dolphins at Wembley Stadium in London, but the NBA's leaked plans go far beyond that. A report on the Sports Illustrated Web site, says NBA commisioner David Stern will reveal his proposals on the eve of the All-Star Game in New Orleans this weekend. The plans are understood to include the formation of a European division with five new teams in major markets. The teams would play a full 82-game schedule and compete for the NBA championship. It is not the first time that Stern has entertained the concept of overseas expansion. He broached the idea in 2003, saying at the time that the league would look into European expansion within a decade. Those plans were scrapped, however, with the NBA instead focusing on developing its relationship with China and other emerging basketball markets. The number of European and overseas players has steadily increased in the NBA and basketball enjoys a particularly high profile in Spain, France, Italy, Greece and the Balkans.

Iraqis mourn outside the Sadr City hospital Wednesday after several people were killed in clashes. Most of the casualties consist of civilians and \"criminal elements attacked by us,\" said Tahseen al-Sheikhly, a spokesman for the Baghdad security crackdown called Operation Enforcing the Law. Civilians are being caught in the crossfire because militants \"use the population to cover themselves,\" al-Sheikhly said. The number of Iraqi civilians killed and wounded nationwide continued to increase during April. According to Iraq's Interior Ministry, 969 civilians died and 1,750 were wounded during April. In March, the total was 923 civilians killed and 1,358 wounded -- a sharp increase over February, when 633 died and 701 were wounded. Despite Shiite militants' calls for the Iraqi government to honor a cease-fire, al-Sheikhly said, the crackdown on insurgents will end when the insurgency ends. \"I don't think there is a timetable for all this. I can't tell that this will end tomorrow or the day after,\" he said. The attacks \"will end when those aspects of violence end.\" He echoed sentiments expressed earlier in the day by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who said the government will not accept the existence of a nongovernment armed force. Word of the casualties came as the U.S. military said its highest death toll in seven months reflected an effort by Iraqi militants to reassert themselves after weeks of government crackdowns.

The first incident occurred about 1 a.m. during a walking patrol in northern Baghdad, the military said. The other two died about 4:50 p.m. when an improvised explosive device detonated in southern Baghdad, the military said. Names of the soldiers were withheld pending notification of their relatives. Another U.S. soldier died Wednesday in a bombing in the northern Iraqi province of Ninevah, according to the military. The deaths bring the April death toll for the U.S. military to 50, the highest monthly tally since September. Most of the deaths occurred in and around Baghdad, and most were combat-related. Since the war in Iraq began, in March 2003, 4,062 U.S. service members have died. Over the past several weeks, militants have increased mortar and rocket attacks against civilian, government and military targets, said Gen. Kevin J. Bergner, spokesman for Multi-National Force-Iraq. \"These indirect fire attacks have killed some 40 people in Baghdad, with some 370 others injured,\" he said.

The wounded were taken to a hospital in Hawija, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) southwest of Kirkuk. U.S. and Iraqi troops have clashed with Shiite militants in Sadr City, a sprawling, crowded Shiite slum. Many of the militants are loyal to cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and his Mehdi Army militia. Much of the fighting has been between the Mehdi Army and U.S.-backed Iraqi security forces, which are dominated by a rival Shiite group, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. The fighting intensified March 25, when the Iraqi government announced a crackdown on \"criminal elements\" in Basra, a Shiite stronghold in southern Iraq. The fighting soon spread through southern Iraq's Shiite heartland and into Shiite neighborhoods in the capital. There also has been violence in areas dominated by Sunnis, such as Nineveh and Anbar provinces. Skirmishes in Sadr City were aggravated this month when al-Sadr aide Sayyed Riyadh al-Nuri was shot outside his home in the Shiite holy city of Najaf. Al-Sadr suspended the activities of his militia in August. U.S. military commanders cited the suspension as a major reason for a decline in violence in Iraq. Another factor, commanders said, was last year's troop escalation, dubbed the \"surge.\" Al-Sadr issued a cease-fire for his followers March 30. Fighting in Sadr City waned but remained intense, the U.S. military said. The cleric has intermittently appealed for calm and threatened to rescind his cease-fire order in recent weeks. Al-Maliki has threatened to boot al-Sadr's supporters from parliament if the Mehdi Army does not stand down. An adviser to al-Maliki said this week that the government would halt its assault on militias if the groups hand in their weapons, turn in wanted militia members and refrain from interfering in the affairs of the Iraqi government and security forces. Al-Sadr has rejected the offer, saying al-Maliki hasn't kept his end of the present cease-fire -- under which, the cleric's supporters said, the Iraqi government would free nonconvicted prisoners belonging to the Sadrist movement and discontinue attacks on al-Sadr's followers. Last week, al-Sadr threatened to wage \"open war\" on U.S. troops if attacks do not cease. He issued a separate statement Friday to emphasize that his militia would target \"occupiers\" and not Iraqis. In that statement, al-Sadr also said he would not accept the long-term agreement that the United States and Iraqi governments are crafting to replace the U.N. mandate for multinational forces in Iraq.

United held on to draw the first leg 0-0 at the Nou Camp last Wednesday after Cristiano Ronaldo missed an early penalty for the English champions. \"It is a difficult place to go and they have a strong team, but I believe we can qualify. United are a team that will not be afraid. They play like they know and have a strong mentality and a lot of talent,\" Rijkaard. \"They do not complicate things. They will go forward more than in the Nou Camp and that could give us chances. Defending is not our style. We need to worry only about the way we play.\" United may be missing England striker Wayne Rooney and Serbia defender Nemanja Vidic. Both sat out Monday's training session after suffering injuries during Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Premier League title rivals Chelsea. Vidic, who missed the first leg because of a stomach problem, lasted just eight minutes at Stamford Bridge before being stretchered off after being accidentally kneed in the face by Chelsea striker Didier Drogba. Rooney injured his hip before scoring the equalizer -- his 18th goal this season -- and was replaced in the 63rd minute by Cristiano Ronaldo.

Brady is sacked by defensive end Michael Strahan in the third guarter of the Super Bowl. Brady has weaved his magic behind an all but impregnable offensive line all season but not on Sunday as he was sacked five times in the 17-14 defeat to the New York Giants. \"They have some great pressure schemes, obviously some great pass rushers,\" Brady said. \"Once we kind of got the idea of what we were doing, I thought we handled it much better, but we didn't get the ball in the end zone enough.\" Coming in, Brady had been sacked a career-low 24 times this season playing behind a line that produced three Pro Bowlers in Koppen, left tackle Matt Light and left guard Logan Mankins. Throw in right guard Stephen Neal and right tackle Nick Kaczur, and Brady played most of his record-breaking season not having to worry much about getting hit by bloodthirsty defenders. \"I like when I don't get touched,\" Brady said earlier in the week. Then, disaster struck -- in the form of an all-out, pressure-packed swarming defensive attack by the Giants -- in the worst possible setting. It was the first time Brady had been sacked as many as five times since the New York Jets did it on Sept. 21, 2003. New England had no answer for the Giants' bulldozing defense. \"If I could tell you, we'd have it fixed,\" running back Kevin Faulk said. \"At the same time, they outplayed us.\" They sure did, and left Brady wondering what hit him. Brady simply had no time to find Randy Moss and his other targets on a regular basis against the Giants. With 19 seconds left in the game and the Patriots facing a do-or-die scenario, Brady was sacked for the final time when Jay Alford pulled him down at New England's 16-yard line. Brady was left with nothing to do but try two straight desperation heaves to Moss to no avail. \"I think their intensity from the beginning snap to the end of the game was really higher than ours,\" Moss said. \"We just couldn't meet that intensity.\" With help from their linemen, the Patriots set NFL records for points scored and total touchdowns, while Brady broke the league mark for TD passes and Moss set the record for scoring receptions. That high-powered offense was held to a season-low 14 points in the Super Bowl -- mostly because it couldn't get time. \"They played well defensively,\" coach Bill Belichick said. \"They've been able to rush. They led the league in sacks, they rushed all year. They are a good defensive football team. They played well.\" \"We all could've done things better tonight,\" Brady said. E-mail to a friend .

Sgt. Merlin German was 22. He was severely wounded February 21, 2005, en route to Camp Ramadi when his Humvee hit a roadside bomb. He was not expected to survive, but he was transported to Germany and then to Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas, which has the U.S. military's top burns unit. He spent nine months in intensive care and underwent more than 100 operations. German moved out of the hospital into his own home after 17 months of treatment. He founded Merlin's Miracles, a charity that aims \"to assist burned children and their families to take vacations, trips, outings or anything the families needed to make life a little easier,\" according to its Web site. German died April 11 at Brooke Army Medical Center of complications after surgery. \"He beat all odds and then on top of that continued to serve as an inspiration and motivator for others,\" said Dr. Evan Renz, a critical-care surgeon who treated German. \"It is very difficult to describe the sense of loss. He endeared himself to all he came in contact with. It's really impossible to describe, except to say: Imagine the loss of dear family or friend.\" Renz remembers being impressed with German from the start. \"This young man was clearly showing us signs he was going to fight through this from the very first minute,\" he said. \"There was consensus he was going to be a someone who would probably break some of the previous expectations about survivability.

President Manuel Zelaya chews on a slice of Honduran melon to demonstrate its safety. \"It's not in our fruit,\" he said about last week's report by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that some Honduran cantaloupes may be contaminated with salmonella. \"It's not true what they are saying. Logically, we believe it is an error.\" Then, the 55-year-old father of four asked the viewers of CNN en Espa\u00f1ol to indulge him as he engaged in a show-and-tell demonstration. \"Permit me a second,\" he said as he stretched his left arm across the tabletop and outside the view of the camera, then pulled into view a box of fruit. \"Here I have the box of melons that we are exporting to the United States; here are the protective bags,\" he said. Zelaya lifted a cantaloupe from the box, placed it in front of him, then grabbed a knife and a fork. \"Permit me to make a demonstration,\" he said, then cut open the fruit, sliced off a chunk, put it in his mouth and chewed vigorously. \"I eat this fruit without any fear,\" he said with his mouth full. \"It's a delicious fruit. Nothing happens to me!\" Though the symptoms of salmonella infection -- nausea, vomiting, fever, diarrhea and abdominal cramps -- typically do not occur for several hours after eating tainted food, the point was made. The demonstration came three days after the FDA said it had linked 50 cases of salmonella in 16 states and nine in Canada to melons from Agropecuaria Montelibana, a grower and packer in San Lorenzo, Honduras. Though there have been no reports of fatalities, 14 people have been hospitalized in Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin, the FDA said. While the company has continued exporting to Europe and Central America and has received no reports of illness, the daily export of 45 containers of melon to the United States has halted, a company official said Monday. As a result, some 1,500 workers have been laid off, most of them single mothers, and company losses have exceeded $3 million, company officials said. The FDA alert advised U.S. grocers, food-service operators and produce processors to remove from their stock any cantaloupes from the company. The agency also recommended consumers throw away any cantaloupes determined to be from the company. E-mail to a friend .

The voice calls for the people of neighboring countries \"to do their best in supporting their mujahedeen brothers in Iraq.\" \"My speech to you is about the siege of Gaza and the way to liberate it,\" he said. \"The Gaza siege is a direct result of Annapolis,\" he adds, apparently referring to the site of November's summit in Annapolis, Maryland, where Israeli and Palestinian leadership agreed to work toward a two-state solution. The voice also calls on \"Muslims in the neighboring countries\" to support the \"mujahedeen in Iraq.\" The broadcast comes a day after another statement attributed to the al Qaeda leader condemned European countries for siding with the United States in Afghanistan and for allowing the publication of cartoons considered insulting to Islam's prophet, Mohammed. \"This is the greater and more serious tragedy, and the reckoning for it will be more severe,\" the speaker in the five-minute audio recording says. The speaker said Muslims have not responded by mocking Jesus, whom they consider a prophet as well. \"The laws of men which clash with the legislation of Allah the Most High are null and void, aren't sacred and don't matter to us,\" he said. The speaker dismissed claims of free speech in his statement, citing European countries' laws against denying the existence of the Holocaust. Bin Laden also said in his earlier message that \"the crownless king in Riyadh\" -- Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah -- could have prevented the publication of the cartoons \"if it mattered to him.\" \"If there is no check on the freedom of your words, then let your hearts be open to the freedom of our actions,\" he said. Though the voice sounds like bin Laden, CNN has not been able to confirm that it is him. However, a radical Islamist Web site reported earlier Wednesday that a statement from bin Laden was coming soon. The notice appeared on Al-Ekhlaas, known for carrying statements and videos from al Qaeda and its allies. Analysis of previous statements has indicated that bin Laden was the speaker, and a U.S. intelligence official said there was no reason to think the recorded voice was not bin Laden's. Bin Laden, who was behind the terrorist network's September 11 attacks, has been in hiding since the U.S. assault on Afghanistan that followed those strikes. His last public statement was an audio message issued in December, when he urged his followers in Iraq to continue battling U.S. troops there. Wednesday marked the fifth anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. The latest statement included no date reference beyond the cartoon controversy, which began in late 2005 when a Danish newspaper published a dozen cartoons about Islam, including one that depicted Mohammed wearing a turban resembling a bomb. Violent protests erupted in early 2006 after other European newspapers reprinted the images as a matter of free speech. Some Muslims believe it is forbidden by the Quran to show an image of the prophet at all, and others were offended that the cartoon by artist Kurt Westergaard appeared to depict Mohammed as a terrorist. Westergaard said he wanted his cartoon to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terror. Several newspapers in Denmark reprinted the controversial cartoons in February after Danish authorities arrested several people who were said to be plotting a \"terror-related assassination\" of the cartoonist. That sparked violent protests in three Afghan cities this month, with Muslim students burning flags and chanting anti-Western statements. The message said the publication of the drawings in question \"came in the framework of a new crusade in which the Pope of the Vatican has played a large, lengthy role.\" Pope Benedict is scheduled to visit the United States next month, with scheduled stops at the White House, the United Nations and Ground Zero, where the Twin Towers stood until al Qaeda's attack. Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne of the New York City Police Department said the department \"has been working closely with the United States Secret Service to provide the highest level of protection possible\" during the Pope's visit to New York.

Glenn Beck says to always question conventional wisdom. NEW YORK (CNN) -- \"The people who survived the Great Depression were the ones who had money to buy when everybody else was selling.\" -- My grandfather . I learned a lot from my grandfather, but that might have been the greatest lesson he ever taught me. He wasn't just talking about managing money, he was talking about managing life -- and his words have stuck with me since I was a child. A few years back, I was taking a theology course and the professor recommended only the books whose authors he agreed with. I read those books, but I also asked that professor which books he thought had it completely wrong -- and I read those too. Then I made up my own mind. After all, following the herd is fine until they all run off the side of a cliff together. Less than a year ago, a recession was the last thing on anyone's mind. In fact, over the summer, as I was questioning the conventional wisdom, I read an article on my television show that quoted a financial expert as saying, \"It is the strongest global market that we've seen in the history of measuring these things.\" That's when I realized how fast the herd was approaching the cliff. But with predictions of a recession now more common than Fed rate cuts -- and that's saying something -- maybe now it's time to look at a worst-case scenario. After all, considering all sides of an issue, no matter how extreme they may be, doesn't make you a crazy person; it makes you an educated one. So to understand what a real meltdown could look like, I turned to Nouriel Roubini, chairman of RGE Monitor and professor of economics at New York University's Stern School of Business. He's also a former adviser to the U.S. Treasury Department. Professor Roubini recently laid out what he called the \"12 steps to financial disaster.\" Unfortunately, they were really complicated, and I have severe ADD, so I've boiled them down into five phases that even a rodeo clown like me can understand. I think of these like our military's \"DEFCON\" -- or defense readiness condition -- scale, except that this countdown could end in the meltdown of your bank account: . \u2022 DEFCONOMY FIVE . How you'll know we're here: The housing downturn turns into a free fall, making it the worst collapse in our country's history. That not only triggers massive numbers of foreclosures and lost household wealth, but it also sets off another large wave of bank write-downs. Odds we get here:  Roubini told me that it's \"extremely likely, even unavoidable\" that we hit this stage because \"the excess supply of new homes in the market is like we've never seen before.\" Prices, he believes, \"need to fall another 10 to 20 percent before that clears.\" \u2022 DEFCONOMY FOUR . How you'll know we're here: Americans upside-down on their mortgages and unable to pay their home equity loans begin defaulting on other debt, like credit cards, car loans and student loans. In addition, bond insurance companies lose their perfect credit ratings, forcing already troubled banks to write down another $150 billion. Odds we get here: High. Roubini says that 8 million households are already upside-down on their mortgages and he thinks we could see that number go to between 16 million  and 24 million by the end of 2009. A lot of those people, he believes, will simply walk away from their homes and send their keys back to the bank. \u2022 DEFCONOMY THREE . How you'll know we're here:  Some banks begin to crack under the pressure of continuing write-downs and mounting defaults by consumers. A national or large regional bank finally collapses, triggering hedge fund failures and general chaos on Wall Street, potentially leading to a 1987-style market crash. Odds we get here:  Very good. Roubini says that we'll likely socialize the losses, \"effectively nationalizing the mortgages or the banks.\" It would be, he told me, \"like Northern Rock (the large bank in England that was recently taken over by the British government) times three.\" He thinks the stock market will head south throughout the year as fears about a severe recession are confirmed. \u2022 DEFCONOMY TWO . How you'll know we're here:  Most forms of credit (both to consumers and businesses) become virtually nonexistent. That results in a \"vicious circle\" of additional write-downs, stock market losses, and bank collapses, which leads to even less credit being available. Odds we get here:  Good. Roubini says that credit conditions are becoming worse everyday across a variety of markets and won't be getting better anytime soon. Without extra credit available, people might have to actually (gasp!) live within their means. \u2022 DEFCONOMY ONE . How you'll know we're here:  Welcome back to 1929. A full economic meltdown results in a complete failure of the underlying financial system. What will be known to future generations as \"The Greater Depression\" has arrived. Odds we get here: Not likely. Roubini believes that this will be a \"very painful and severe recession\" that could last for 18 months or more, but it will be more like 1981 than 1929. Families may be eating soup again, but at least it'll be in their own kitchens. Now, do I think any of what you just read will happen? I have no idea, and that's exactly the problem. I'm not an economist or a stockbroker; I'm just a guy trying to make the best decisions I can, and picking the brains of real experts helps me do that. But I do know one thing for sure: Depressions aren't advertised in advance. Last time around we went from the Roaring '20s to bread lines in a matter of just a few years. Anyone who says that can't happen again either doesn't know history, doesn't understand how interconnected the world's economies have become, or is lying to you. While that doesn't mean you should panic, it does mean you should prepare -- something my grandfather would've done a long time ago.

Officers lead Al Sharpton, center, through Jena, Louisiana, during Thursday's protest. They swarmed over the grounds of Jena High School, where nooses were hung from a tree in early August 2006, about three months before six black teens known as the \"Jena 6\" were accused of beating a white classmate. While the tension was palpable, news broke Thursday afternoon that the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeal ordered a hearing within 72 hours to determine if the only one of the six still behind bars can be released. The order has \"got to be good,\" Mychal Bell's attorney, Bob Noel, told CNN. \"It means we have a day in court. Any day in court is going to be a good day.\" Earlier, there was an aura of a pilgrimage at the site where the controversial tree once stood before school administrators had it removed. Many people touched the ground and some retrieved a lump of dirt, said CNN's Eric Marrapodi. He said the part of the town he was in was ill-prepared for the crowds -- no water or toilets were available. In the background, groups shouted \"Black power\" and \"No justice, no peace.\" The estimated 15000 to 20,000 demonstrators shut down the town of 3,000 in central Louisiana. Many residents left for the day, and government agencies, businesses and schools were closed. Sgt. Tim Ledet of the Louisiana State Police said protesters in buses were still bringing people to town at midday because of the gridlock, but many protesters got off and walked into town on foot. \"There is just no room to maneuver in this small town,\" he said. Jena resident Terry Adams disagreed with any accusations that there might be a black-white divide in the area. \"We are not a racial town. We get along with each other, we get along fine. This is something that got out of proportion. It really has.\" Jena's racial tensions were aggravated in August 2006, when three white teens hung the nooses the day after a group of black students received permission from school administrators to sit under the tree -- a place where white students normally congregated. The guilty students were briefly suspended from classes, despite the principal's recommendation they be expelled, according to Donald Washington, U.S. attorney for the Western District of Louisiana. A member of the LaSalle Parish School Board -- which had a role in supporting suspension instead of expulsion -- insisted the board is not prejudiced. The panel felt it took the appropriate action, Jonny Fryar said. \"I talked to one of the parents, who called me and said their son thought it was a prank and naive to the fact of what it meant and he was sorry,\" he said. \"I hate to see people label us as something we are not. Because we have black students and white students playing football together. They shake hands, get along. This is an unfortunate incident. We hope that the community can heal.\" Although Washington acknowledged the FBI and other investigators thought the noose incident bore the markings of a hate crime, a decision was made not to press federal charges because the case didn't meet federal criteria. The students were under 18 and had no prior records, and no group such as a Ku Klux Klan was found to be behind their actions. On December 4, about three months after the nooses were discovered, six teens, dubbed the Jena 6, were accused of beating classmate Justin Barker. The six -- Mychal Bell, Robert Bailey Jr., Carwin Jones, Bryant Purvis, Theo Shaw and Jesse Ray Beard -- were originally charged with attempted second-degree murder and conspiracy, according to LaSalle Parish District Attorney Reed Walters. Bell, the only one of the six who remains in jail, was to be sentenced Thursday after convictions for aggravated second-degree battery and conspiracy to do the same, but both charges have been vacated, awaiting further action by the district attorney. Charges for Bailey, Jones and Shaw also were reduced to battery and conspiracy when they were arraigned, while Purvis still awaits arraignment. The charges for Beard, who was 14 at the time of the alleged crime, are unavailable because he's a juvenile. Tina Jones, Purvis' mother, condemned Walters. \"I hope that the D.A. will wake up and realize that he's doing the wrong thing, and to release these kids,\" she said. \"It's not equal. The black people get the harsher extent of the law, whereas white people get a slap on the wrist per se. So it is not equal here.\" Jones maintained that her son was not involved in the beating, but watched from a railing, and was not arrested that same day. \"We have a long fight ahead of us, and we'll keep fighting until justice prevails in Jena,\" the mother said. Purvis, who accompanied her, was asked how he's faring. \"I'm doing pretty good. I hope there is a pretty good outcome of what's taking place today,\" he said.  Watch an interview with one of the Jena 6 and his mom \u00bb . President Bush, who was asked about the rally at a news conference, said, \"The events in Louisiana have saddened me. I understand the emotions. The Justice Department and the FBI are monitoring the situation down there. \"All of us in America want there to be fairness when it comes to justice.\" He advised whoever is elected next year to \"reach out to the African-American community.\" Hundreds of college students from historically black schools such as Howard University in Washington traveled to Jena, along with civil rights activists such as Al Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who helped organize the event. Martin Luther King III also attended, saying, \"This is about justice for the six young men.\" Sharpton called Jena the beginning of the 21st century civil rights movement. \"There's a Jena in every state,\" Jackson told the crowd in Jena on Thursday morning. JoAnn Scales, who brought her three teenage children on a two-day bus journey from Los Angeles, California, to Jena, made the same point. \"The reason I brought my children is because it could have been one of them\" involved in an incident like the one in Jena. \"If this can happen to them [the Jena 6] , it can happen to anyone,\" Scales said. Ondra Hathaway was on the bus with Scales. \"If this young man [Bell] was railroaded to do time as an adult, how many more people has that happened to?\" she said. Jackson said on CNN's \"American Morning\" on Thursday that the charges against the black youths, their possible jail terms if convicted and their bail amounts are \"excessive.\" Punishing the teens with probation would have been sufficient, Jackson said. Bails for the Jena 6 were between $70,000 and $138,000, and all but Bell have posted bond. Bell, 17, has been in prison since his arrest. The judge has refused to lower his $90,000 bail, citing Bell's record, which includes four juvenile offenses -- two simple battery charges among them. Bell was 16 at the time of the attack; 17 is the legal adult age in Louisiana. E-mail to a friend .

Canadian NATO-led soldiers walk patrol near Kandahar, Afghanistan. James Appathurai told reporters at a briefing that the move will help NATO meet Canada's requirement that it send more troops to the volatile southern province of Kandahar, where Canadian troops are based. Canada agreed this month to extend its commitment of about 2,500 troops until 2011 so long as NATO contributes more troops to Kandahar. There is a \"clear unity in the alliance\" that the mission in Afghanistan must succeed, Appathurai said. Though 25 NATO allies and 13 other countries have contributed forces, the bulk of the recent fighting has been done by U.S., Canadian, British and Dutch troops. Appathurai also said Thursday that he did not expect NATO applicants Georgia and Ukraine to be put on a membership action plan this summit but, he said, the general sense in terms of membership for the two countries is not \"whether, but when.\" Further discussions regarding those two countries is to resume Thursday, he said. U.S. President George W. Bush has pushed for the admission of Ukraine and Georgia to the military alliance. However, Russia -- which is not a NATO member -- has expressed concerns about the former Soviet republics joining NATO, which has already made members of other former Soviet countries Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. Appathurai also said a general consensus could not be reached on Macedonia's bid, because of Greece's objections. Greece has threatened to veto Macedonia's bid if its northern neighbor does not agree to change its name.

Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton struck a mostly cordial tone during the debate. The exchange was in sharp contrast to previous debates because of the absence of political sniping, yet was one of the most substantive policy discussions yet in the race for the nomination. On Iraq, Obama said he'd be more able to end the war because he opposed it from the beginning. He said Clinton's vote to authorize the use of force there would undermine her efforts to bring it to an end. \"I think it is much easier for us to have the argument when we have a nominee who says, 'I always thought this was a bad idea -- this was a bad strategy,' \" he said. Clinton defended her vote, saying she was told by the White House that it would be used initially to return weapons inspectors to see whether Saddam Hussein had an active weapons program. See where they stand on Iraq . \"I believe strongly that we needed to put inspectors in,\" the New York senator said. \"That was the underlying reason why I at least voted to give President Bush the authority, put those inspectors in, let them do their work, figure out what is there and what isn't.\"  Watch reaction to Clinton's thoughts on Iraq \u00bb .

Clinton noted her experience pushing her husband's plan, saying she's best suited to hammer out the details of a new plan and create \"a coalition that can withstand the insurance and the prescription drug companies.\" The pair praised former North Carolina Sen.

The Democratic race remains close going into Super Tuesday, when more than 20 states -- including California and New York -- will vote. Obama won the season-opening Iowa caucuses, then finished second to Clinton in every contest until last week's South Carolina primary -- which he won with a commanding 55 percent of the vote in a three-way race. Clinton scored victories in the New Hampshire primary and Nevada caucuses. She also was the top vote-getter in Florida and Michigan, although no Democrats campaigned in those states and their delegates to the nominating convention will not count because of a squabble between state and national party leaders over the timing of the primaries. Thursday's debate differed from the last time the two took to a stage together -- at a contentious January 21 debate in South Carolina in which the front-runners peppered each other with sharp attacks. In contrast, on Thursday the two smiled, laughed at each other's jokes and repeatedly complimented the other when they agreed.  What does the debate's cordial tone mean? \u00bb . Obama got laughs when asked about how he might counter Republican charges against \"tax-and-spend liberal Democrats.\" \"Well, first of all, I don't think the Republicans are going to be in a real strong position to argue fiscal responsibility, when they have added $4 trillion or $5 trillion worth of national debt. I am happy to have that argument,\" he said. Clinton drew cheers when she responded to a question about how a Clinton could promote change after decades of a Clinton or Bush in power. \"It did take a Clinton to clean up after the first Bush, and I think it might take another one to clean up after the second Bush,\" she said.  Watch Clinton make a jab at Bush \u00bb . The longest and loudest applause line of the night came when CNN's Wolf Blitzer noted that many Democrats have said they'd like to see a Clinton-Obama or Obama-Clinton ticket in November. Neither ruled out the possibility of selecting the other as a running mate.  Watch the rivals discuss joining forces \u00bb . \"The debate was a rallying debate for Democrats,\" said CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider. \"Democrats like both of them, they continue to like both of them, and they want to vote for both of them.\" Schneider said the cordial tone probably helped both candidates. Obama continued momentum from his victory in the South Carolina primary and high-profile endorsements, including Sen. Ted Kennedy and Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius. Clinton probably maintained her perceived status as the front-runner. \"I'm not sure that he turned the election around,\" Schneider said. \"He is the challenger here -- he's got to persuade people they don't want to vote for her.\" The debate, sponsored by CNN, the Los Angeles Times and Politico.com, was held at Los Angeles' Kodak Theatre, where the Academy Awards are handed out. Hundreds, if not thousands, of Clinton and Obama supporters thronged outside the venue -- cheering and waving signs. The numerous actors, directors and musicians in the audience included Stevie Wonder, Pierce Brosnan, Rob Reiner, Jason Alexander, Isaiah Washington, Diane Keaton, Leonardo DiCaprio, Quentin Tarantino and Christina Applegate. Mike Gravel, the other Democratic presidential candidate still in the race, was not invited to participate in the debate because he did not meet certain criteria, including support in national polls. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll conducted January 14-17, Gravel received less than 1 percent.

Thousands of people have taken to the streets of the South Korean capital in protest at the deal . South Korea banned imports of U.S. beef in 2003 amid concerns over a case of mad cow disease in the United States. The ban closed what was then the third-largest market for U.S. beef exporters. It resumed limited imports last year -- allowing boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of age -- but that re-opening was subject to interruptions and closed altogether in October 2007. A deal that South Korea and the United States struck last month bans the import of high-risk materials, like tonsils, brains, spinal cord marrow and a section of the small intestine, Agriculture Minister Chung Woon-chun said Thursday, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. These parts pose the greatest risk of transmitting mad cow disease to humans. The ban will be lifted within a few days, once the government's new import rules have been published. The pending resumption of U.S. beef imports hasn't been without political costs for President Lee Myung-bak. He apologized to the nation last week for failing to fully understand concerns about mad cow disease. In downtown Seoul, thousands of people have regularly staged protests, chanting \"We don't want crazy cows,\" since the deal to revive beef imports was announced. And the main opposition party has taken up the fight. \"We will be forced to make a critical decision if the government pushes through its plan to announce resumption of beef imports,\" said Sohn Hak-kyu, leader of the main opposition United Democratic Party, Yonhap reported. \"If the government and the ruling party ignore this warning, we will come up with every possible measure to stop them.\" The opposition has already filed a suit to suspend implementation of new beef import terms, according to Yonhap. Lee's ruling Grand National Party (GNP) is working to soothe tensions, saying that American beef is safe to eat and that adequate safety precautions have been taken. \"The government has tried its best to free the public from unnecessary concerns, and sufficient countermeasures have been prepared,\" said Lee Hahn-koo, the party's chief policymaker, Yonhap reported. When South Korea and the United States reached the deal in April to re-open the South Korean market, they removed the major obstacle to U.S. congressional approval of the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Lee urged the National Assembly this month to ratify the agreement as soon as possible to provide fresh impetus to the sluggish Korean economy, saying it will create 300,000 jobs. But the opposition has promised to fight the FTA until the beef pact is nullified. In 2003, the United States exported $815 million pounds of beef and beef variety meats to South Korea. The U.S. beef industry has lost up to $4 billion since the market closed, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation.", "25b7adf8bfe43c2953a874b18c7766370158638a": "SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- In a recent commentary, I wrote that, as a Mexican-American, the ugliness of the immigration debate offends me -- not as a Mexican, but as an American. Ruben Navarrette Jr. lists 10 things U.S.-born Hispanics find distasteful about the immigration debate. A woman wrote in and asked me to be more specific: Just what was it about the immigration debate that was so ugly? She came to the right place. After nearly 20 years of writing opinions and insisting that I don't speak for all Hispanics, in recent months, I've heard from hundreds of Hispanics who -- appreciative of my middle-ground approach to the immigration issue -- insist that I can speak for them anytime. So, with the authority vested in me, I'll now share some of what other Hispanics are saying. It's not far off from what Janet Murguia had to say. As president of the National Council of La Raza, the largest Hispanic civil rights organization in the United States, Murguia recently delivered an important speech to the National Press Club. The topic: the immigration debate and what she called a wave of hate sweeping the land -- one that isn't limited to illegal immigrants, but which is now affecting all Hispanics regardless of where they were born, what language they speak or what flag they salute. The way Murguia sees it, immigration is \"on the verge of becoming one of the largest civil rights issues of our generation.\" And, Hispanics are playing the pi\u00f1ata. Murguia was right on the button. To borrow a phrase, it's getting ugly out there. And U.S.-born Hispanics see it as plain as day. Here are 10 things they find distasteful about this debate: . \u2022 The hypocrisy. We have two signs on the U.S.-Mexican border: \"Keep Out\" and \"Help Wanted.\" \u2022 The racism. With lightning speed, the debate went from anti-illegal immigrant to anti-immigrant to anti-Mexican. \u2022 The opportunism. Too many politicians are trying too hard to portray themselves as tough on illegal immigration. \u2022 The simple solutions. \"Build A Wall.\" \"Deport All Illegals.\" A quick rule of thumb: If it fits on a bumper sticker, it's not a workable policy. \u2022 The naivet\u00e9. People ask why Mexico won't help stop illegal immigration. Hint: Last year, Mexicans in the United States sent home $25 billion. \u2022 The profiling. Dark skin and Spanish surnames shouldn't be proxies for undocumented status. Been to Arizona lately? \u2022 The meanness. Nazi-produced Internet video games let players shoot illegal immigrants crossing the border. Fun stuff. \u2022 The amnesia. Americans think grandpa was welcomed with open arms and that he plunged into the melting pot. Whatever. \u2022 The buck-passing. Americans love to blame Mexico for their choices, yelling across the border: \"Stop us before we hire again.\" \u2022 The double standard. The same folks who have zero tolerance for illegal immigrants easily tolerate those who hire them. Some of this is painfully familiar, recalling earlier versions of this debate as it played out a hundred or two hundred years ago. Hispanics are the new Germans, the new Irish, the new Italians. But it's also ugly. It was then. It is now. Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a member of the editorial board of the San Diego Union-Tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist. Read his column here.

But then again Switzerland will not have their injured captain Alexander Frei.\" Turkey will be sweating on the return of defensive duo Servet Cetin and Gokhan Zan, who will be given until the last minute to prove their fitness. \"They have both had a hard time but they are really devoted to the team,\" said Terim. \"We will make a decision on whether they will play tomorrow.\" Terim, whose side lost 2-0 against Portugal in their opening game, remains confident that his team can still qualify from the group stage. \"Everyone is aware of how important this game is,\" he said. \"We are confident in ourselves and I believe we will succeed in this tournament. For us, the game against Portugal wasn't the key but this one is. \"Of course, every team wants to begin a competition with a win but it didn't happen but that doesn't mean that we can't do well.

We will have to fight hard to beat them.\" The last time both teams met was in a qualifying play-off for the 2006 World Cup, when Switzerland prevailed on away goals.

Demario James Atwater, 21, was arrested early Wednesday at a residence in Durham, North Carolina. Authorities were watching the home after receiving a tip that Atwater was inside. He was charged with first-degree murder in Carson's death. Atwater is believed to be the man in a convenience-store photograph released by police. A second suspect, Lawrence Alvin Lovett Jr., 17, is being sought in Carson's death, police said. He also faces a first-degree murder charge. Lovett could be armed and dangerous, police told CNN affiliate WRAL. Police believe Lovett was the man seen in a surveillance-camera photo possibly using Carson's card at an ATM, Chapel Hill Police Chief Brian Curran said. The pictures showed a young man wearing a hooded sweatshirt and baseball cap. There also appeared to be a large, shadowy form of another person in the back seat of the vehicle, which may have been Carson's SUV. Police believe Atwater was in the back seat, Curran said. He would not comment on whether physical evidence links the two suspects to the crime. Atwater was taken to a hospital as part of the evidence collection process, he said, and brought back to make an initial court appearance. \"As encouraging as the developments today are, we are still a community in grief,\" Chapel Hill Mayor Kevin Foy told reporters at a news conference announcing the arrest. \"We also still must offer comfort to a family in mourning, Eve's family.\" Carson, 22, was found shot to death about 5 a.m. March 5. The medical examiner told police that her body showed no signs of sexual assault or other injury, Curran said. Carson's killing \"feels like a random crime,\" Curran said Saturday. On Sunday, more than 1,000 people crowded the First United Methodist Church in Carson's hometown of Athens, Georgia, for her funeral, the Athens Banner-Herald reported. The UNC-Chapel Hill board of trustees had pledged $25,000 to the Crime Stoppers program in the area for information leading to the arrest of anyone responsible in Carson's slaying. Carson was a student member of the board and student body president. The young woman was a pre-medicine student who was double majoring in political science and biology.

Photographers surround singer Britney Spears' car in Los Angeles, California, in October. Kenneth Starr -- the independent counsel whose open-ended investigation of a Clinton land deal veered into an intimately detailed report on the president's affair with intern Monica Lewinsky -- is helping California lawmakers craft laws to crack down on celebrity-hunting packs of paparazzi. Malibu Mayor Pamela Conley Ulich contacted Starr, now a law school dean at Pepperdine University in Malibu. Local governments in Los Angeles and West Hollywood are also part of the effort to curb what they call a dangerous and expensive problem. \"Just imagine you're a motorist driving down the street and Britney Spears parks next to you; all of a sudden you're swarmed by these people,\" Los Angeles city Councilman Dennis Zine said. \"They've got cameras; they're jumping on the hood of my car. \"You don't know if you're getting carjacked. You don't know what's happening.\" The idea of a \"safe zone\" around celebrities has been kicked around by L.A.-area lawmakers for years. The push became more intense in the wake of multiple mob scenes around pop star Spears last year, including a virtual siege of her Studio City, California, home and similar scenes during her trips to hospitals. Starr has been in contact with the officials but is \"not ready to publicly comment\" on any plan he may have, according to a Pepperdine spokesperson. Lawmakers have set no timetable for when they'd like to have laws drafted. Police Chief William J. Bratton has argued that there's no need for new laws to deal with the problem. But Zine and others argue that police resources are stretched thin by the current state of things, citing $25,000 shelled out last year for a police escort for Spears. To some, Starr -- the man vilified by liberals for a lengthy and costly Clinton investigation that turned up Clinton's personal foibles but no major wrongdoing in the Whitewater land deals -- seems an odd partner for politicians in the notoriously left-leaning Los Angeles area. \"The irony is that he was so criticized, so vilified by Hollywood liberals 10 years ago during the Monica Lewinsky impeachment saga,\" said David Mark, a senior editor at Politico. \"Now he's kind of aligned himself with a lot of Malibu residents who probably disagree with him politically.\" But Zine, who has been a prime backer of laws curbing the \"Pap Packs,\" said Starr's expertise will be valuable as lawmakers try to strike a balance between public safety and First Amendment freedom of the press concerns. \"I have a lot of respect for Ken Starr,\" Zine said. \"We don't want to violate any rules. We don't want to violate the Constitution. \"We believe that the Constitution needs to be upheld [but] at the same time, we need to protect our celebrities.\" CNN's Carol Costello contributed to this report.", "abc4744227c6bf0ddbf64cac2269bd4c6d02938b": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Responding to recent accidents linked to pilot fatigue, federal safety officials hope reduce airline pilots' logging 14-hour days. The FAA currently allows pilots to log 14-hour workdays, which the NTSB says contributes to accidents. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded in a report out Tuesday that pilot fatigue was a probable cause in a runway landing accident during bad weather in Michigan last winter. There were no fatalities. The Federal Aviation Administration currently allows a 14-hour workday with eight hours of logged airtime. \"It's a critical issue; it's an insidious issue. Many times, the pilots themselves don't even recognize that they are fatigued when they get into that cockpit,\" NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said. And Rosenker made the same points about air traffic controllers more than a year ago, in April 2007. In a letter to the FAA, Rosenker said that four other plane incidents \"provide clear and compelling evidence\" that controllers are sometimes operating while fatigued because of their work schedules and poor use of rest periods. \"That fatigue has contributed to controller errors,\" Rosenker wrote in 2007. \"Fourteen hours is still a very long day,\" NTSB board member Debbie Hersman said. Her conclusion is backed by 40 years of airline accident statistics compiled by the FAA and cited Tuesday at an NTSB hearing. \"After a duty period of about 10 to 12 hours, the number of observed accidents increased exponentially,\" NTSB staff member Malcolm Brenner said. In February, the cockpit crew of a passenger plane operated by Mesa Airlines failed to answer air traffic controllers for 18 minutes, missed the flight's destination in Hawaii and continued for another 15 miles at 21,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean. The investigation has shown that \"both pilots unintentionally fell asleep during cruise flight,\" NTSB staff member Jena Price said during a presentation to the safety board. The crew of Go! Flight 1002 eventually answered concerned calls on the radio from ground controllers, turned around and safely landed. The NTSB report called for analysis of sleep quantity, sleep quality, performance, errors and incidents traced to schedules that disrupt sleep patterns, perhaps while stretching workloads to the maximum allowed. \"They cannot just keep pushing pilots until they drop,\" said the head of the Air Line Pilots Association, Rory Kay. He said during a break in the NTSB hearing that \"pilot pushing\" is an issue. \"We are in tough economic times, we're being asked to do more with less, and we have to support the pilot when he makes the determination that it's time to call it quits,\" he said. After reviewing some possible remedies against fatigue in the cockpit, board members unanimously approved the proposal to the FAA, which would be responsible for developing guidance for the airlines to carry out. The FAA plans to hold a symposium on fatigue management next week with representatives from the aviation industry. \"I want the FAA to have a complete overhaul of the flight time/duty time regulations\" that presently allow a 14-hour day with eight hours of flight time, Kay said.", "f7e5e75031e9f099564ed046bd822ef1bedb3188": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado (CNN) -- President Bush told the 2008 graduating class at the U.S. Air Force Academy on Wednesday that the \"only way America could lose the war on terror is if we defeat ourselves.\" President Bush and Air Force Academy graduate Michael Riddick of Aiken, South Carolina, celebrate graduation. Speaking on a cloudy day at Falcon Stadium, the president compared the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to America's earlier conflicts, particularly World War II. \"Our nation is once again contending with an ideology that seeks to sow anger, hatred and despair: the ideology of Islamic extremism,\" he said. \"In today's struggle, we are once again facing evil men who despise freedom and despise America and aim to subject millions to their violent rule. \"We assumed this obligation before,\" he said, referring to the rebuilding of Germany and Japan after World War II, a conflict that saw the loss of more than 400,000 American lives.

We'll lay the foundation of peace for generations to come.\" But today's wars differ from those of the past, Bush acknowledged, and not only because of modern technology that allows \"greater precision\" in warfare. \"One challenge is that in the past, in Germany and Japan, the work of rebuilding took place in relative quiet,\" he said. \"Today, we're helping emerging democracies rebuild under fire from terrorist networks and state sponsors of terror. This is a difficult and unprecedented task -- and we're learning as we go.\" The measure of success in war has changed, he said. \"In the past ... there were public surrenders, a signing ceremony on the deck of a battleship, victory parades in American cities. Today, when the war continues after the regime has fallen, the definition of success is more complicated.\" Nonetheless, he said, in Iraq and Afghanistan, there is a clear definition of success: when those countries are rid of al Qaeda, when they are economically viable, when they are democracies that can govern effectively and when they are strong allies on the war on terror. \"These successes will come,\" he told the class. \"And when they do, our nation will have achieved victory, and the American people will be more secure. \"", "9a8ee7eb582f293c617eecab5f37374d9400bb04": "(CNN) -- China's economy is booming and Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum's visit there this week highlights the U.A.E.'s ambitions to join in on this growth. CNN's John Defterios (JD) sits down with Shaukat Aziz (SA), former Prime Minister to Pakistan to talk about the emerging relationship. Former Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz . Aziz is an expert in global banking who worked in the Middle East for a number of years as an official for Citigroup. He was an influential player in the process of creating a free trade agreement between Pakistan and China, after visiting the country in 2005. Shaukat Aziz talks about the growing ties between China and the Middle East, and gives us inside knowledge on doing business in China. (SA): I think the two economies are complementary. China is a global economy which is growing rapidly. It has one of the highest growth rates in the world, and it is expanding its footprint all over the world. Dubai and the U.A.E. is clearly a hub for South Asia, the Middle East, and the whole region. They are a trading center, they are a financial center, and they don't compete directly with China, in fact both economies will compliment each other. I think the U.A.E. Prime Minister's trip will help to further reinforce this and get the two countries closer together, in trade, in financial flows, in linking capital markets and many other initiatives. (JD): Trade has been growing 30 to 40 percent over the last four years. But can it move beyond hard Chinese goods going into the Gulf? (SA): Of course it can. I think the nature of Dubai is such that it has now become the clearing house for goods from all over the world. And buyers go to Dubai and look for the best product at the best price. So, if China, being a large country, can bring its products to Dubai, it will help both countries. May I also say that I see China evolving as an exporter of capital, not just goods because China is running huge surpluses. Their reserves are at an all time high. So they are looking for investments too, and you see now a trend in Chinese companies to buy companies overseas. A trend in Chinese companies to invest overseas because they want, once they go global, they want production facilities all over the world. So the design and the research and development will be done in China, the components will come from China, but the manufacturing could move across the world. This trend is already started and I think this will all go well for both countries. (JD): Lets take it a step further. Do you see Chinese investment funds or Sovereign Funds and U.A.E. sovereign funds going out together to acquire companies in the near future? (SA): Sure, there have been situations where both have participated in different companies. (JD): But separately. (SA): Separately, but I think they could join too. But the real issue on sovereign funds is being represented in certain quarters as if this is something which is unhelpful to the global economy. In my view, in an era of globalization we must open up our markets for investments and let anybody come along in line with the rules of that country. May I say that the sovereignty of any country is a very robust concept. And if a foreign sovereign fund or investor comes along and buys a bank in a particular country, the countries sovereignty is never jeopardized. But, if you have good regulators and good policies, because even in a deregulated environment, regulation is necessary. Deregulation does not mean abdication by the government, so if your regulatory regime is sound, you don't have to worry. Sovereign funds have demonstrated that they have helped promote economic activity, help save certain companies, banks as a case in point. And it's a win-win for both sides. So I think this question of their role is over stated. (JD): Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah went to visit China when he came into power in early 2006. Is itinevitable that U.S.-European Allies in the Gulf turn to the East now and look for new partnerships in an East-East equation? (SA): This is the fastest growing economy in the world. It is absorbing foreign investment, it is exporting investment. It is the largest producer of goods and services now, in terms of growth rate. So Saudi Arabia, naturally, the largest economy in the Middle East by a long margin, needs to link up a country like China. I think it is not geo-politics which is driving it. It is economic necessity. It is tapping into growth. Saudi companies are investing in China. I know that in the energy sector Aramco has gone in for joint ventures and maybe SABIC too, and that is to me a very positive development. Because it is showing that capital looks for opportunities and if there is return China is not far enough.

People arrested by Bangladesh police in their latest round-up arrive at a jail in Dhaka. Human rights groups decry the actions as politically motivated. The round-ups began May 28, days after the two main political parties said they would not cooperate with the military-backed caretaker government on organizing the elections. Police told CNN that by Saturday 16,916 arrests had been made, while local media reported another 1,548 were arrested Sunday. The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said hundreds of their party members had been taken into custody. \"The timing and targets of the arrests are a dead giveaway they are politically motivated,\" Brad Adams of the New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a statement. \"It's obvious that they are paying the price for the political parties' refusal to accept the government's conditions to participate in the elections.\" The government rejects the allegations. The detentions, it said, are part of a planned sweep to rid the country of criminals. \"Our IGP [Inspector General of Police, or chief of police] categorically said this special drive was being conducted to create a congenial atmosphere before the general election,\" said Kamrul Ahsan, a spokesman for Bangladesh Police. \"It is not politically motivated,\" he said. \"The intention is not to harass anybody politically.\" The crackdown began after the Awami League and the BNP said they would not cooperate with the government to develop a roadmap toward democracy unless it first releases the parties' leaders. The two women who head the parties -- Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League and Khaleda Zia of the BNP -- are in police custody on corruption-related charges. Hasina is charged with bribe-taking. Zia is being held on charges of graft for improperly awarding a multi-million dollar government contract. The current political crisis in the Muslim-majority South Asian country of 150 million can be traced, in large part, to the lingering animosity between the two women, political observers say. Their rivalry runs so deep that the women are known in the country as the \"Battling Begums.\" Begum is an honorific given to women of rank in the country. Since the country's independence in 1972, the Awami League or the BNP has ruled Bangladesh for all but eight years. Both women have served as prime minister at one point or another. After its last stint in power ended in 2006, the BNP handed over rule to a caretaker government to conduct elections, as mandated by the country's constitution. But the Awami League refused to recognize the neutrality of the interim government. Hasina accused Zia of stocking it with BNP backers. Supporters and party members took to the streets in months of deadly clashes. To stem the tide of violence, a military-backed government took control in January 2007 and imposed an indefinite state of emergency. It also postponed elections until it said it could clean up the country's graft-ridden politics. The caretaker government adopted the Emergency Powers Rules. The rules allowed authorities to arrest people without a warrant as long as there was reasonable suspicion that he or she was connected to a crime, Human Rights Watch said. A wave of detentions followed. By some estimates more than 90,000 people were detained before some were released and others charged with crimes. Among those arrested were more than 150 top politicians, including Hasina and Zia -- leading to the current political stalemate. The government wants to hold elections in the third week of December, and said the crusade on crime is part of its plan to ensure trouble-free balloting. The political parties allege the arrests are intended to pave the way for the election of pro-government candidates. They want their leaders set free before they sit down and talk with the government about a roadmap toward a successful election. They also threatened to organize mass movements to secure their leaders' release. \"It's kind of an impasse,\" said Taleya Rehman, founder and executive director of the Bangladesh-based non-profit Democracy Watch. \"The government is conducting political dialogue with small parties.

A similar release for Zia was also expected. Party members say the government's move is a ploy to sideline the pair from the elections by sending them out of the country.

In addition to political party members, the crackdown has also swept up several journalists. \"That actually makes the arrests suspicious in some people's minds,\" said Sultana Kamal, executive director of the legal aid group, Ain o Salish Kendro (Law and Adjudication Center). \"If you just arrest any Tom, Dick and Harry saying this person may have arms, then people will legitimately raise questions about the mode of the whole operation.\"", "698cdb1268d4da1240d7f540bd4a5af4e229d00f": "(CNN) -- World No. 3 Maria Sharapova has blasted the ruling body of women's tennis over its demands for top players ahead of this month's Italian Open in Rome. Maria Sharpova is furious after being threatened with a $300,000 fine by the WTA. The Australian Open champion is furious after being threatened with a $300,000 fine if she does not participate in a publicity event before the Tier 1 tournament. \"I want all my fans to know that the WTA Tour is forcing me and several of the other top players to do a four-hour commercial shoot for WTA Tour marketing materials,\" Sharapova told her Web site. \"They want me to do this shoot on Sunday, Monday or Tuesday of the Rome tournament after flying 12 hours from Los Angeles. \"I have set my own personal rules when it comes to doing shoots and I never do shoots before tournaments because they are mentally draining and I want to just focus on my tennis. \"Now the WTA is telling me if I don't do this shoot they will fine me over $300,000. As you can see the WTA Tour loves to fine players. \"To be honest, I would love to do this and help promote the tour as much as possible, but to force me to do this shoot the day before a Tier 1 tournament is just not right.\" The 21-year-old will be returning to action in the event starting May 12 after skipping Russia's Fed Cup semifinal against the United States last weekend. She was beaten by Serena Williams in the quarterfinals of the Family Circle Cup in Charleston in her last outing two weeks ago.

The sentencing hearing for Lance Cpl. Larry A. Dean, 20, is scheduled to begin on Friday. Dean is among four Marines under court-martial in the case. The others are Sgt. Lanaeus J. Braswell, 25; Gunnery Sgt. Carl M. Anderson, 39; and Gunnery Sgt. Jarvis D. Raynor, 34, the military said. Local media reported that the four men met the woman in a restaurant in Hiroshima on October 14, 2007, then allegedly attacked and raped her in a car in nearby parking lot. Japanese authorities investigated but decided in November not to file charges. Dean also was found guilty of conspiracy to commit indecent acts and two minor charges. He was acquitted of conspiracy to kidnap or rape. The case is similar to a recent alleged sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl involving a U.S. Marine on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa. That case sparked outrage and stirred memories of an earlier rape committed by U.S. servicemen. Staff Sgt. Tyrone Luther Hadnott, 38, was charged last month with the rape of a child under 16, abusive sexual contact with a child, making a false official statement, adultery and kidnapping, the military said. In February, Japanese authorities released Hadnott after the girl dropped the allegations, but the Marine Corps conducted its own investigation to see if Hadnott violated codes of military justice. The military is holding him at a Marine facility. More than 40,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan, most of them on Okinawa, which accounts for less than 1 percent of Japan's total area. The U.S. military presence has at times bred resentment among locals, who have long complained about crime, noise and accidents. Anti-American sentiment boiled over in 1995, after three American servicemen were convicted in the kidnapping and gang rape of a 12-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl.

A flood victim hangs precariously during a rescue flight Sunday. Two people died and at least two others were hurt, said Michelann Ooten, a spokesman for the state's emergency operations center in Oklahoma City. A middle-aged man who had stopped to help another person wound up drowning in his vehicle near Kingfisher, Oklahoma, and an elderly woman in Fort Cobb, Oklahoma, who had sought protection in her storm cellar drowned there, Ooten said. The injuries occurred when either straight-line winds or a tornado destroyed a house in Watonga, she said. \"I'm certain there are many more injured,\" she said. \"This is all courtesy Erin, the new four-letter word,\" she said. Officials were searching for three other people who had been traveling together near Carnegie, Oklahoma, and were reported missing, she said. In Kingfisher, Oklahoma, the storm dropped five to 11 inches of rain in a short period of time, causing Kingfisher Creek to rise 25 feet and overflow its banks, said Capt. Chris West of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. \"It's the highest it's ever been,\" West said. \"There's about 200 to 300 people that are displaced out of their homes.\" By 6 p.m. floodwaters in Kingfisher had begun to subside, but the storm system had not yet exited the state, Ooten said. Flood warnings were issued until midnight for parts of eastern Oklahoma, she said. The helicopter rescue operation got under way Sunday morning, after authorities got a call alerting them that a pickup truck containing two passengers had been swept from a bridge over Kingfisher Creek, West said. First, a helicopter dropped life vests to the couple, whose pickup truck was nearly obscured by the water. Soon afterward, their truck was simply swept away, and the pair were left to fend for themselves in the water until the rescue helicopter approached. First, a rescuer grabbed the woman and pulled her toward the skid on which he was positioned. For a few seconds, she held on as the helicopter rose, but lost her grip and fell back into the water. The helicopter circled back for a second effort, which this time proved successful. The drama from the town of about 14,000 residents 35 miles northwest of Oklahoma City unfolded live on national television. \"When the lady fell, I was kind of surprised, I hated to see that,\" said West, who watched the rescue on television. \"We were able to get back around, get her picked up.\" Like his partner, the man also fell, was picked up again and taken to safety. The rescue work then focused on removing people stranded atop the roofs of vehicles and buildings. Time and again, the pilots positioned their helicopters inches above choppy water as rescuers helped men and women grab the skids. Residents of nearby Apache, Oklahoma, faced similar floods, which caught most people off guard, said Lt. Bobby Claborne of the Apache Fire Department. \"We never thought we'd have a tropical storm in our area,\" he said. No evacuation plans were initiated until early Sunday, \"but it was a little late\" by then, he said. For several hours, thousands of people were without power in El Reno, which had been inundated by more than six inches of rain in just a few hours. And some vehicles were trapped on Interstate 40 in western Oklahoma, said Capt. Ken Brown, the state police operations commander in El Reno. \"Two different semis were overcome by water and required fire rescue to get the drivers from their vehicles,\" he said. Boats and other watercraft were enlisted in the rescue effort. West said the flooded areas have sustained extensive damage -- \"not only to homes and businesses and automobiles, but to these agricultural areas.\" \"We have a lot of roadways that will be damaged from this,\" he said. \"There's going to be a lot of debris that floated in. And you know, road crews are going to have to get out and clear those.\" Meanwhile, floods around the upper Midwest washed away roads and bridges, killing four people,The Associated Press reported.

The five survivors were found and airlifted to land around 2 a.m. Sunday, the Coast Guard said.

Coast Guard Lt. Justo Rivera, who was flying the aircraft that rescued the men, told CNN affiliate KHOU that a flashlight helped save them. While conducting search patterns, Coast Guard members spotted the light through their night vision goggles, Rivera said. It was being held by one of the men. He said that because the Coast Guard was searching such a vast area, the flashlight was \"instrumental\" in the rescue. \"It's your proverbial needle in a haystack,\" Rivera told KHOU. During the 26-hour wait, the group was nibbled by curious reed fish and circled by a fish with triangular fin that extended from the water like a shark's fin. \"They bumped up against us and kind of nibbled on our clothes,\" Conway said. \"You don't know how big the thing is and how hungry it is.

Unfortunately, nobody knows exactly when that was. Jack Daniel believed the more memorable his image, the more memorable his whiskey. Some records show that Jasper Newton \"Jack\" Daniel came into the world on September 5, 1846. His tombstone, however, says 1850. Strange, because his mother died in 1847. All of this might not normally matter, but Jack's birth date is important to his overall legend, which proudly proclaims him \"the boy distiller.\" So perhaps it's best we begin when Jack was first introduced to whiskey, which we know was early in life. Leaving home at a young age, Jack struck out on his own with nothing more than a handful of items valued at $9. He ended up at the home of Dan Call, a preacher at a nearby Lutheran church and the owner of a general store. There, Reverend Call also happened to sell whiskey that he distilled himself. Jack quickly became determined to learn the craft. In fact, many storytellers claim the boy wonder bought the still from Call and began pursuing the business full-time at the ripe age of 16. If that legend is true, then Jack began selling his own Tennessee whiskey only three years later; the famous black labels on the company bottles proudly pronounce, \"Established and Registered in 1866.\" In reality, no documents support that myth. Jack may have been a teenage moonshiner, but he didn't register his business with the federal government until 1875. And by then, Jack would have been the more booze-appropriate age of 29. The maker makes his mark . Whatever legends exist, one thing is certain: Jack Daniel had a brilliant mind for marketing. Even as a youngster, Jack understood that if people remembered him, they would remember his whiskey. To that end, he decked himself out in a formal knee-length coat, a vest, a tie, and a wide-brim planter's hat, and was never caught out of \"uniform\" again. Jack also established the Jack Daniel's Silver Cornet Band -- a 10-member outfit solely devoted to promoting his whiskey across the countryside. With uniforms and instruments from the Sears & Roebuck catalog and a specially designed wagon for traveling, Jack made sure the band played every saloon opening, Fourth of July celebration, and political rally around. But perhaps Jack's most brilliant decision concerned how to present his whiskey. From the beginning, Jack had been one of the first sellers to stencil his distillery name on his whiskey jugs. Next, he upgraded to round, custom-embossed bottles. But when a glass salesman showed him a prototype square bottle in 1895, Jack realized he'd stumbled upon something unique. The new bottles not only stood out from the crowd, but also had a shape that would prevent them from rolling around and breaking during transport. In addition, the square look reinforced the idea that Jack was a square dealer who put honest work and high standards first. Whatever effort Jack Daniel put into his marketing, he never let quality slip. In 1904, the distiller decided on a whim to enter his whiskey in the taste competition at the St. Louis World's Fair. It came as little surprise when he won. Lucky No. 7 . Perhaps Jack's greatest coup was the name he gave his high-quality product -- Old No. 7. Naturally, nobody seems to know why. The official historian at the Jack Daniel Distillery today says it's the most oft-asked question on factory tours. As you might imagine, many theories have been advanced. Jack had seven girlfriends. Jack believed the number seven was lucky. Jack was honoring a merchant friend who owned seven stores that distributed Jack's liquor. Jack misplaced a batch of whiskey for seven years and, upon finding it, labeled it \"Old No. 7.\" None of these stories, however, makes as much sense as the less-than-sexy explanation from Jack Daniel biographer Peter Krass. Simply put, Jack was originally assigned a district tax assessment number of 7. But when the IRS consolidated districts within Tennessee, they arbitrarily reassigned him the number 16. Jack didn't want to confuse his loyal consumers, and he certainly didn't want to bend to the government, so he began labeling his bottles \"Old No. 7.\" More than 125 years later, this act of defiance still makes his labels stand out. Jack without Jill . Jack Daniel never married. Some say it's because he was married to his work; others say it's because he never found a girl who measured up to his high standards. Or perhaps it's just that he was too busy catering to the greater Lynchburg population -- throwing elaborate Christmas feasts, hosting exquisite costume parties in his second-story ballroom, and donating money to every church in Moore County. But by all accounts, Jack was quite a ladies' man. He was a perfect dance partner, a polite conversationalist, and a fantastic gift-giver. Unfortunately, he also gravitated toward girls young enough to be his daughter (or even granddaughter). Once, Jack even asked for a woman's hand in marriage, but her father denied him -- partly because Jack enjoyed keeping his own legend alive and always hesitated to reveal his true birth date. When Jack proposed, her father made it clear that any man unwilling to disclose his age was \"a little too old for such a young girl.\" The early bird gets the gangrene . Hard as it might be to believe, in the end, the great distiller actually died from getting to work too early. As the story goes, one morning in 1906, Jack arrived at his office before anybody else. He tried to access the company safe, but had a terrible time remembering the code. After a few frustrating minutes, he kicked the safe as hard as he could. He badly bruised his left foot and immediately began to walk with a limp. The limp only grew worse with time, and he later discovered the injury had led to blood poisoning. Then came gangrene, then amputation, and then, five years later, death. It's not the happiest ending for the story, or the clearest cut, but it is the best, because it adds to the mystery and mystique of Jack Daniel. As they say, where facts cannot be found, legends fill the empty space and that's perfectly fine for the keepers of the company flame. After all, as Jack himself believed, the more memorable his image, the more memorable his whiskey. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

Spain's basketball team: Able to hum the national anthem, but not sing words. The lack of lyrics in Spain's anthem has long created awkward moments for winning Spanish athletes at the Olympics. They stand on the podium silently or hum along while winning athletes from other nations sing when their anthem is played during their moment of triumph. With the summer Olympic Games fast-approaching, the Spanish Olympic Committee stirred the lyric-writing impulses of Spaniards by sponsoring a competition to provide words for the anthem. The contest drew 7,000 entries, and an expert panel selected a winner. The committee announced plans for renowned Spanish tenor Placido Domingo to sing the lyrics on Monday. Then, suddenly, the committee discarded the winning lyrics. \"Once Spaniards heard these lyrics, they sparked a lot of controversy, even rejection,\" Alejandro Blanco, president of the Spanish Olympic Committee, told a packed news conference this week. The now-discarded winning lyrics had begun with, \"Viva Espana,\" or \"long-live Spain,\" and critics complained that phrase harkened back to the right-wing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco, who led a military uprising in 1936 against the elected government and won a Civil War, ruling Spain until his death in 1975. \"You have to consider that many Spaniards don't consider the national anthem as their own. It was played a lot under Franco,\" said Margarita Saenz-Diez, a journalist. Spain is now a democracy, but many still bristle at the military march that's served for more than two centuries as the national anthem. Spain is made up of many different peoples, and five languages are spoken across the country. The Catalans in the northeast and the Basques in the north already have their own national songs with lyrics. Getting agreement on any lyrics to the national anthem is no easy task and would ultimately have to be approved by Parliament. The president of the Spanish Olympic Committee conceded he doesn't know when there will be lyrics for the anthem, and many here say there isn't enough time to get lyrics approved before the Aug. 8 start of the Summer Olympic Games in Beijing. Yet the search goes on. \"We will continue with the idea of an anthem with lyrics,\" Blanco said. E-mail to a friend .

Members of Students for a Free Tibet climbed the bridge to place these banners, said the group's spokesman. The banner read, \"One World. One Dream. Free Tibet.\" Those who climbed cables from which the bridge is suspended are members of Students for a Free Tibet, said group spokesman Tenzin Dasang. The three were arrested along with four others at the site. All seven were charged with felony conspiracy and misdemeanor nuisance, said California Highway Patrol Officer Mary Ziegenbein. The climbers also were charged with misdemeanor trespassing.  Watch protesters and banner hung from bridge \u00bb . The incident forced the closure of one northbound lane of the bridge. The climbers -- who were on the bridge for about three hours -- came down voluntarily about 1:15 p.m. (4:15 p.m. ET) after workers with the Golden Gate Bridge District began cutting down their banner, Ziegenbein said. Dasang said he has heard of many people planning to protest in San Francisco against China's human rights record. \"We want it to be peaceful. But it will be large,\" said Dasang, 22, during a phone interview in which he said he was near the bridge. \"I heard from Tibetans that now live all over the U.S. and even abroad who are coming here.\" The Olympic flame is on a 130-day journey that will take it through 23 cities on five continents and then throughout China, culminating at the Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing August 8. The San Francisco protest comes the same day as a demonstration in Paris, France, disrupted the torch relay many times. In Paris, police had to cut the Olympic torch relay short Monday amid protests against China's human rights record, French police said. The torch was scheduled to travel 17 miles, past Paris City Hall, but that stop and others were called off after the protests. The torch made it through about 10 miles of its scheduled journey. It was then driven by bus to its final destination, where it was displayed again during a public ceremony at a stadium. Authorities had to play hide-and-seek with the Olympic torch during much of the route, placing it on a bus at least twice during a sometimes chaotic relay route. China has come under international criticism because of its crackdown last month on protesters calling for democratic freedoms and self-rule in Tibet and neighboring Chinese provinces. Protesters have said more than 100 people have died in the crackdown, but Beijing denies that and has accused supporters of the Dalai Lama of orchestrating the violence. U.S. and other Western leaders have called on China to provide civil rights and freedoms to those in Tibet and to enter peaceful discussions aimed at resolving the crisis.

These two adult frilled-neck lizards are threatened species and are bred in captivity in Australia. The WWF's latest Living Planet Index shows terrestrial, freshwater and marine species all suffered declines in their populations between 1970 and 2005, with freshwater species experiencing the biggest drop. The index is included in a report called \"2010 and Beyond: Rising to the Biodiversity Challenge,\" which the WWF prepared for an international biodiversity conference in Germany later this month. \"No one can escape the impact of biodiversity loss because reduced global diversity translates quite clearly into fewer new medicines, greater vulnerability to natural disasters, and greater effects from global warming,\" said James Leape, director-general of WWF International. The Living Planet Index measured 4,000 populations of 1,477 vertebrate species, which the WWF says is a good indicator of overall biodiversity trends. Terrestrial species in both temperate and tropical areas fell by an average of 25 percent during the 35-year period, the WWF said. Marine species fell by 28 percent in the same period, with a dramatic decline between 1995 and 2005, the WWF said. \"Many marine ecosystems are changing rapidly under human influence, and one recent study estimates that more than 40 percent of the world's ocean area is strongly affected by human activities while few areas remain untouched,\" the WWF report said. Freshwater species in both temperate and tropical regions fell by 29 percent between 1970 and 2003. The WWF said that is especially significant because despite covering only about 1 percent of the total land surface of the planet, inland waters are home to more than 40,000 vertebrate species. In tropical regions, freshwater species were especially hard-hit; the index shows they suffered a 35-percent drop between 1970 and 2000. The WWF said it had insufficient data to chart tropical freshwater species beyond 2000 and temperate freshwater species beyond 2003. The causes of the declines are varied but ultimately stem from human demands on the biosphere, such as consumption of natural resources or the displacement of ecosystems, the WWF said. The dominant threat to marine life is overexploitation -- harvesting or killing animals or plants beyond the species' capacity to replace itself, the WWF said. Overfishing is one example. Overexploitation is also a threat to terrestrial species, according to the report, which cites the hunting of tropical forest mammals. Overharvesting of timber is also a major factor, it said. Invasive species, whether introduced deliberately or not, are another threat, especially in freshwater ecosystems, where they are thought to be the main cause of extinction among endemic species, the WWF said. Pollution and overall climate change are other factors causing a loss of biodiversity, it said. The WWF called on governments attending this month's conference to take urgent action to reduce the rate of loss by 2010. It wants governments to establish protected areas, particularly those areas important for food security, water supply, medicine, and disaster mitigation, and to commit to zero deforestation by 2020.", "60f518dff20b2936b104035b1fd9584dd7d16def": "COLORADO CITY, Arizona (CNN)  -- A 16-year-old girl in Arizona has alleged sexual abuse in a Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints community, sources in Arizona told CNN Friday.

Authorities are investigating calls made by a teenage girl alleging abuse in her home by a male relative, according to the sources, who said the calls were similar to those made last week to Texas authorities from the polygamist sect's ranch in Eldorado, Texas.

ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- My love for University of Memphis basketball is completely irrational. I never went to school there and have no affiliation with the university. But I bleed Tiger blue. My dad used to take my brothers and me to Memphis games as a kid, and I've been hooked ever since. We once bought tickets from a scalper for six bucks apiece against arch-rival the University of Louisville in the 1980s. My dad complained we paid too much. But then we moved in seventh grade. I became an even bigger fan after we left the city. I'd huddle over my AM radio, hooked up with a coat hanger wrapped in aluminum foil as an antenna. More than 350 miles away, I managed to pick up the then-Memphis State games through the crackle and static of the radio. Memphis basketball was my only way to remain connected to my youth and the city that I loved. That was 1985, the last time Memphis made the Final Four. Is your team in the Final Four? Send your iReport celebratory photos . Back then, Memphis was led by a phenom named Keith Lee. He was best known for a sweet baseline jumper as soft as the nylon nets he swished. He was also known for his giant Afro. He was listed as 6 feet 10 inches. The joke was if you included his wild hairdo, he was 7-4. When my parents were away at work, sometimes I'd sneak into my mom's cabinet, steal her mousse and then put it in my hair. Then this white kid would go out back and shoot hoops for hours, hair sticking straight out like I stuck my finger in a socket. It was the only way I could be like Lee, my hero and idol. Back then, Memphians would rank Lee right up there with Elvis Presley as the city's most popular icons. Many still do. And that's the thing about Tiger basketball. In a place where race has often divided so much of it, Memphis basketball has helped unite the city. As a boy, white and black kids would crowd the basketball court at Tiger games to try to snatch the players' sweatbands as they raced into the locker room. Up until I graduated from high school, the sweatbands of Phillip \"Doom\" Haynes and Baskerville \"Batman\" Holmes sat on my shelf in my room. Like a fan of any team, there have been good and bad times over the years. But sometimes the pain of being a Tiger fan is that much greater. Tragedy and heartbreak are part of it, such as  when Holmes killed his girlfriend and then himself in 1997. Other players, such as Aaron Price and A. Maceo Battle, have died far too young along the way, furthering the pain of being a fan. Larry Finch -- who as a black player brought together the city and took Memphis to its only national championship game in 1973, and later became one of its greatest coaches -- has lived much of the past few years in a rehabilitation center after suffering severe strokes. In some ways, that's what makes Memphis basketball so special. Memphis players embody the real life of so many Americans, many faced with extreme hard times. Some succeed; some don't. Others, such as Finch, keep on fighting. I don't find it an accident that Memphis is now seeking history the same week of the 40th anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. \"I think Dr. King would find this a source of joy,\" the Rev. Jesse Jackson told the team this week, according to the Memphis Commercial Appeal newspaper. A city that has seen so much pain, so much heartache, has something huge to celebrate -- all revolving around young college kids and a bouncy orange ball. The adage is that sports often have the ability to transcend the moment. This is one of those times. To get to the championship game Monday night, Memphis must first get past UCLA, the same team that defeated it in that 1973 title game. While much of the rest of the nation has the team pegged to lose, the Tigers -- for one shining moment -- have a chance to do something really special. They'd have it no other way. As for me? I won't be listening on my old radio, but this weekend I might just try sporting that 'do like Keith Lee. The opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of the writers.

We asked the four gorgeous stars of ABC's new TV show \"Cashmere Mafia\" to take part in a little experiment: If you could slip into a different guise for a day, what would it be? Frances O'Connor in Zac Posen silk gown, Jos\u00e9 and Mar\u00eda Barrera rhodium-plated earrings with Austrian crystals. Frances O'Connor glams it up . Understated when it comes to her own style and buttoned up in banker stripes as Zoe on Cashmere Mafia, Frances O'Connor, 40, has been hankering for an infusion of pure glamour. \"I love the idea of wearing a dress that's a work of art in itself,\" says the actress, who slipped easily into a red-carpet fantasy with a mouthwatering cherry-hued gown by Zac Posen. O'Connor's \"safety first\" approach to fashion means living mostly in simple Marc Jacobs pieces, but it's a sensibility that doesn't offer much in the way of frippery -- which suits her just fine. \"I don't like to stand out too much,\" says the willowy Anglo-Aussie beauty. Still, Posen's fluttering cascades of silk offer both a role reversal and a respite. \"A fantasy has to move you to feel like a different person,\" she says. \"That's fun for a day. Then I like to put my jeans back on and go home.\" Lucy Liu relives the forties . Few decades enthrall Lucy Liu like the 1940s. \"I like the idea of updating a traditional silhouette from that era in a fresh way,\" says Liu, whose character, Mia, reigns over a New York publishing fiefdom in power looks by Dolce & Gabbana, Valentino and Rachel Roy. Despite its abstract floral print, the ruffled organza dress by Christian Lacroix would seem right at home on the cover of a World War II-period glossy, yet Liu imbues it with a distinctly modern verve. \"There was something really elegant and erotic about women back then, with their girdles and cinched-in waists,\" she says. On the set the 39-year-old star relishes watching costume designer Patricia Field work her sartorial sorcery with a swirl of offbeat textures and trimmings. \"The other day my character was wearing a gold lam\u00e9 striped dress with a coffee-hued belt, black leggings and green earrings. It's contagious,\" says Liu, who finds herself mixing -- and not matching -- more freely these days. Miranda Otto indulges in gems . Famous for playing a Middle Earth maiden in the Lord of the Rings movies, Aussie actress Miranda Otto found herself dressing a little like one offscreen too, in muted, ethereal garb. But her arctic complexion and fiery tresses are the perfect canvas on which to throw splashes of drama. \"Shooting Cashmere Mafia [the 40-year-old beauty plays steely hotelier Juliet] has made me lust for accessories,\" she says. Presto: Otto is resplendent in scads of jewelry. \"Wearing stacks of the stuff makes it more interesting,\" she adds. There's just one catch to donning such beguiling accents: \"My 2-year-old daughter, Darcey, wants everything.\" Bonnie Somerville goes for fifties bombshell . Bonnie Somerville longs for the bygone days when women were perennially polished. \"In the fifties you'd never leave the house without your hair done, your face on, and a nice dress. Me, I have my staple uniform of jeans, tank tops and flats.\" To resolve her clothing ennui, the actress chose a dazzling yellow Lela Rose number that is equal parts Bond Girl and Palm Beach socialite. \"It's something I never thought I could wear for daytime,\" says the Brooklyn, New York-bred singer and actress who plays Cashmere's trendy cosmetics exec, Caitlin. A skinny metallic belt gives the look more of a now vibe. \"On the show, with everything we wear, Patricia Field says, 'Put a belt on it!'\" says Somerville, 33. \"Now I'm buying belts in my real life, which I never did before.\" E-mail to a friend .

Having watched Autism is a World, do you have any follow-up questions you'd like to ask Sue? Suggested Activities . 1. What are Autism Spectrum Disorders? Inform students that, though the field of autism research is continuing to evolve, much has been learned about the disorder since the mid-1940s, when Dr. Leo Kanner published his first paper identifying autistic children, and Dr. Hans Asperger described a milder form of autism that became known as Asperger syndrome. Autism is considered a \"spectrum disorder\" because the number and intensity of symptoms can greatly vary among those with autism. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD), which are also known as \"pervasive developmental disorders,\" can often be detected by the age of three. ASD is an umbrella term that includes the following diagnoses: . Divide your students into five groups and assign each group a different ASD from the list above. Instruct each group to conduct research to learn about the symptoms, characteristics and differentiated diagnoses associated with its assigned disorder. Then, have groups prepare presentations of their findings that include a brief mock case study to illustrate how the disorders might manifest in a child. After the presentations, challenge students to identify the common traits associated with all autistic disorders. (All people with ASD have impaired communication, problems with social relationships and like to engage in repetitive motions.) Ask students: . Following the discussion, refer students back to Autism is a World to make a list of the symptoms and behaviors that Sue Rubin displayed during the program. Then ask students: Based on what you know about Ms. Rubin, where would you say that her disability falls within the spectrum of autistic disorders? 2. Treating Autism . Point out to students that, although autistic symptoms in children may lessen with age, autism is a lifelong disorder. There are various types of therapies available for treating autism, including behavior modification, sensory integration, medications and dietary interventions. However, because the nature and severity of autistic symptoms and behaviors can vary, no one approach works for every person. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, most professionals agree that early intervention is important and that most individuals with ASD respond well to highly structured, specialized programs. After you have shared this information, pair students and assign each pair one of the following ASD treatment approaches: . Biomedical Treatments . (CNN does not endorse any specific medication. The information provided here is meant as an overview of the types of medications sometimes prescribed.) Instruct each pair to investigate the philosophy, protocols and benefits and drawbacks associated with its treatment method. Have pairs deliver presentations of their findings. (If possible, have the students who are presenting behavior modification approaches demonstrate the techniques, and have the students who are speaking about medications and dietary interventions include graphics that depict how the treatments are thought to affect the different parts of the human body.) Following the presentations, pose the following questions for class discussion: . Extension: Have students draw upon thier research to create an informational brochure about ASD for parents and local mental health providers. Keywords .

Beyonce: \"I'll stick with one scent for five or six years. I'll wear it all the time.\" Beyonc\u00e9 . What was your first perfume? 273 by Fred Hayman. I wore it when I was a teenager.

Getting ready, curling my hair, putting my makeup on, going out to a party. And my mother, my childhood, my house. What does your house smell like? Vanilla. Warm and sweet. I have a lot of Diptyque candles around the house. Even when I'm away, I have someone burn them. I like having the scent in my pillows. (Diptyque Opopanax candle, $55; bergdorfgoodman.com) You're the face of Emporio Armani Diamonds, which has rose and raspberry notes. What's it like? Soft, sweet and comforting. Yesterday I had a day off, which is rare, and I took a long bath. When I got out, I was by myself and knew I would be all day, but I still sprayed it on. (Emporio Armani Diamonds, $50/1.7 fl. oz.; at Macy's) What other scents do you like? My favorite scent is my mother's cooking: her yams and her soul food. They smell like love, like being full and happy. How about men's cologne? I like [anything by] Creed. (Creed Original Santal, $110/1 fl. oz.; neimanmarcus.com) Emmy Rossum . What fragrance did your mom wear while you were growing up? Lanc\u00f4me Tr\u00e9sor. It still reminds me of watching her get ready to go out at night. (Lanc\u00f4me Tr\u00e9sor, $81/3.4 fl. oz.; lancome-usa.com) What was your first perfume? I got Elizabeth Taylor White Diamonds for my sixth birthday. I felt so sophisticated! I'd put my mom's red lipstick on my lips and cheeks, wear her high heels and spray the fragrance all over myself and the house. (Elizabeth Taylor White Diamonds, $65/3.3 fl. oz.; perfumania.com) Which kind of fragrances are you usually drawn to? I like ones that are clean, feminine, and not so famous that they are immediately recognizable. I [rarely] tell anyone what scent I wear -- it's a woman's most precious sensual secret. Can you let us in on some of your all-time favorites? My favorite is Miss Dior Ch\u00e9rie. It's classic and feminine, but flirty. I wear it to lunch, to dinner parties, to the beach, skiing and to big occasions like the Oscars, when I want to feel especially glamorous. (Miss Dior Ch\u00e9rie, $65/1.7 fl. oz.; at Nordstrom) What men's scent do you like? Angel Men. It's masculine and very appealing without being too strong.

How is your new fragrance, Covet, different from Lovely, the first one you helped create? Lovely is very polite. It's the girl you marry, and Covet is the girl you date, you know?

Love's Baby Soft. (Love's Baby Soft body spray, $12/1.5 fl. oz.; at drugstores) If you got a whiff of it right now, what memories would it trigger? It would be seventh grade and not having enough disposable money. It would be Fiorucci, a shirt tied in a knot at the waist, and the Yankees. It would be fighting with my brothers and sisters before school and my mother yelling at me, and not finishing my homework on a Sunday night. Do you wear fragrance every day? Without question. For some women, it's lip gloss or mascara or covering a blemish. I can do without all of that. But the idea of not putting on perfume is shocking to me. Where do you apply it? I love walking into a closet and smelling lingering aroma, so I always spray my clothes. And at the end of the bottle, when the atomizer no longer reaches the tiny little dribble that is left, I unscrew the top and pour the remainder onto a T-shirt or my dress. What's your favorite men's scent? I really love Old Spice and Guerlain Vetiver for men. (Guerlain Vetiver, $74/4.2 fl. oz.; saks.com) What home fragrance do you love?

(Est\u00e9e Lauder Pleasures, $45/1.7 fl. oz.; at Macy's) What perfume did your mom wear when you were a kid? She wore Quadrille by Balenciaga, and they don't make it anymore. I always go online trying to find bottles [stashed] in someone's basement to give to her as a present because she's almost out of it. Has your taste in scents changed since you became a mom? No, but when I was pregnant I couldn't tolerate the smell of anything, whether it was garlic, orange juice or perfume. Now do you avoid scents that might overwhelm little noses? I just don't overdo it. A little spritz goes a long way. What are some other, non-perfume fragrances you love? I love the smell of lilies and paperwhites. I also burn these tea-scented candles from Mariage Fr\u00e8res. The best shampoo I've ever found is Japanese -- it's called Molto Bene B: Oce. It's so good for dry hair like mine. (Mariage Fr\u00e8res Th\u00e9 Rouge candle, $65; aedes.com; Molto Bene B: Oce Shampoo SE, $16/8.1 oz.) What scent do you love on men? Ocean water. I like natural scents. Victoria Beckham . How would you describe Intimately Beckham? It's a white-flower fragrance with a lot of tuberose, which is my favorite flower. It's fresh and sexy in a fashion-y way. I think it's a happy smell. (Intimately Beckham, $42/1.7 fl. oz.; ulta.com) Does it remind you of anything? White flowers remind me of my grandmother: timeless and gorgeous. Everything I wear I would like to think of as timeless as well. I still wear dresses I bought 10 years ago. So you like florals? I love rose, tuberose and orange blossom. I'm a real girlie girl -- I love perfume, makeup and hair products. I think I know how girls want to smell. Do you wear different scents for different moods? For me it's more about the weather and what you're wearing and who you're with. Intimately Beckham is light, and perfect for warm weather. That's why we came up with Intimately Beckham Night (coming next year), which is slightly heavier. How involved was David in creating the fragrance? He was hands-on. He's masculine, but he's in touch with his feminine side too. He loves clothes and beauty products and aftershave. Which men's scents does he like? David and I both love Miller Harris. (Miller Harris Feuilles de Tabac, $120/3.4 fl. oz.; bigelowchemist.com) What was your first fragrance? Coco Chanel. If I smelled it today, it would take me back to being 14, just when I was first really getting into fashion. (Chanel Coco, $110/3.4 fl. oz.; at Nordstrom) What scent did your mom wear? Poison by Christian Dior. It was so distinctive. It instantly reminds me of the eighties -- all that hair and those big dresses. (Dior Poison, $43/1 fl. oz.; drugstore.com) Any other favorites? I love Jo Malone's grapefruit smells. And I have to say, nothing looks better in the bathroom than a bottle of Chanel No. 5 -- that's the ultimate. E-mail to a friend .

Additional Reporting By Kwala Mandel; Alysia Poe; Suzanne Zuckerman .", "26d0a5624f3ee7605833c641da5d88e2259b1162": "JERUSALEM (CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council failed to reach a consensus when it met to consider condemning an attack that killed eight people at a prominent Jewish seminary as an act of terrorism. Ambulance workers put one of the casualties from the seminary attack into an ambulance. The council said Libya -- a new, nonpermanent member -- blocked the statement on Thursday night. Ibrahim Dabbashi, Libya's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, said the attack on the school was no different than Israeli military offensives against militants in Gaza. But Dan Gillerman, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, said he saw no connection between Thursday's shooting and Israel's operations in Gaza. \"This is not a story of retaliation,\" he said. \"These people have been terrorizing Israel for years, have been carrying out suicide bombings and indiscriminate attacks for years.\" A gunman broke into the Jewish seminary about 8:30 p.m., spraying automatic-weapons fire, authorities said. Most of the victims were students in their teens and 20s, medical officials said. At least nine others were wounded before an off-duty Israel Defense Forces officer fatally shot the gunman, Jerusalem District Police commander Aharon Franko said. The gunman was carrying an AK-47 and a pistol -- and had time to swap weapons during the massacre. Police are trying to identify the gunman and figure out how he managed, while drawing little notice, to enter the large three-story school in a bustling residential neighborhood. \"There was no alert or warning about this attack,\" Franko said.  Watch the immediate aftermath of the attack \u00bb . A first responder said the bodies were on the floor of the study hall surrounded by holy books. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Video from Thursday's scene showed a frantic crowd of rescue workers carrying bloodied victims into ambulances. Dozens of police officers were scouring the campus and streets around the yeshiva in case there were other gunmen. Outside the school, scores of Israeli men gathered from surrounding neighborhoods, demanding justice for the attack. Authorities are calling the incident at west Jerusalem's Merkaz Harav yeshiva an act of terrorism. The school is one of the largest seminaries in Israel, with about 500 students in the yeshiva and 200 in an advanced graduate program. \"Israel is at the forefront of the struggle against terrorism and will continue to defend its citizens, who are exposed to this threat on a daily basis,\" Israel's Foreign Ministry said in a written statement. \"Israel expects the nations of the world to support it in its war against those who murder students, women and children, by any means and with respect for neither place nor target.\" President Bush backed Israeli leaders in a statement issued Thursday, saying, \"I condemn in the strongest possible terms the terrorist attack in Jerusalem that targeted innocent students at the Merkaz Harav yeshiva. This barbaric and vicious attack on innocent civilians deserves the condemnation of every nation.\" But Libya's Dabbashi compared the attack with \"bloodshed in the Palestinian territory.\" \"For us, the human lives are the same. We judge the incident itself,\" Dabbashi told reporters after the Security Council meeting. \"When we have to condemn the killing of the Israeli civilians, we also have to look at what's happening in Gaza.\" Jerusalem security increased . Security was bolstered, with thousands of additional officers across Jerusalem and the rest of Israel, authorities said. Meanwhile, celebratory shooting took place in Gaza City after the news of the attack, with hundreds chanting and clapping in the streets. But Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas criticized the killings. \"The Palestinian Authority condemns any attack on innocent civilians,\" Abbas' office said in a written statement. The shootings came just a day after U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who met with both Israelis and Palestinians, announced that peace talks will resume between the two sides. Abbas suspended peace negotiations last week after fierce fighting broke out between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, but he agreed to resume negotiations after meeting with Rice. Israel will continue peace talks with the Palestinians regardless of the attack in Jerusalem, Foreign Ministry spokesman Aryeh Mekel said Thursday. Israel conducted a large-scale operation in Gaza to hunt down Palestinian militants who have been firing dozens of rockets into Israel. At least 70 Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers were killed during the operation, Israeli and Palestinian sources said. Militants also fired at least 25 rockets toward Israel, wounding at least two civilians. \"This operation came directly after the attack committed inside Gaza. This operation is a normal response,\" said Fawzi Barhoom, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza.  Watch Barhoom's reaction to the attack \u00bb . Gillerman said the Security Council should condemn the attack. \"They are so, so quick sometimes to criticize Israel for defending itself. I would like to see those members convene as we speak in order to condemn this in the strongest possible terms.\" Thursday's attack was the worst inside Israel since April 17, 2006, when a suicide bombing outside a falafel restaurant in Tel Aviv killed nine people. Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for that attack. Attacks in Jerusalem are rare. Eight people were wounded August 10 in the Old City when a Palestinian resident grabbed a security guard's gun and fired; and four Israeli security guards were wounded May 26 when two Palestinian gunmen began firing in east Jerusalem. All three of the assailants were killed. E-mail to a friend .

Levonda Selph of Virginia admitted accepting $4,000 in cash and a $5,000 vacation to Thailand from the unidentified contractor, which was awarded $12 million in contracts to operate Defense Department warehouses in Iraq. She pleaded guilty to charges of bribery and conspiracy. She was secretly indicted on those charges in October; the charges weren't disclosed until her court appearance Tuesday. Under terms of a plea agreement, Selph could receive up to 33 months in jail. She promised to repay the government $9,000 and to cooperate in an ongoing investigation. Prosecutors said Selph was a lieutenant colonel at Camp Victory in Iraq in 2004 and 2005 when she led a committee that awarded the warehouse contracts.

But how will the ease of restrictions on transatlantic routes affect business travelers? Under Open Skies, European and U.S. airlines will be given unlimited access between Europe and U.S. points. The treaty puts an end to the exclusive arrangement granted to British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, United Airlines and American Airlines to fly transatlantic out of London Heathrow. But with the airport currently operating at almost-maximum capacity, new flights will be severely limited. As a result competition is fierce for Heathrow slots, with airlines paying as much as $60 million to get their hands on them. For each flight that is added, another less lucrative service is scrapped. Airlines are giving priority to high-yield business routes to and from Heathrow. While European carriers are now allowed to fly from any point within E.U across the Atlantic, the U.S. domestic market remains closed to them. Operators in Europe hope that a second phase of the Open Skies deal will mean a relaxation of restrictions on European airlines' investment in U.S. carriers and the ability for European airlines to compete in the U.S. domestic market. The issue is pending in U.S. Congress. If the U.S. doesn't deliver, there is a clause in the agreement that states the Open Skies treaty -- phase I included -- can be torn up. Industry experts foresee some fare wars in both economy and business-class. Service options are also likely to improve as competition intensifies. U.S. airlines will vie with BA, the dominant carrier at Heathrow, that currently has flights to 24 U.S. cities. The biggest challenge to the incumbent airlines operating out of Heathrow will come from carriers in the SkyTeam alliance, that includes Air France and KLM, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines News, and Continental Airlines. Before Open Skies, the SkyTeam alliance offered no transatlantic routes to and from Heathrow. By summer they will offer 10 percent of these flights. SkyTeam carriers will be located for the first time in Terminal 4. Given the size of the market for U.S.-London flights, airlines will continue to offer services from Gatwick, London's second-busiest airport. Open Skies will intensify competition for ailing U.S. airlines on what has been their most profitable route. Analysts expect to see consolidation between U.S. airlines as they combine international networks to beat competition. One advantage U.S. airlines can offer is opportunity for connecting flights to other European cities as well as on to Asia and the Mideast. European carriers on the other hand, cannot operate domestic flights within the U.S. New flights and new airlines . Oneworld Alliance . British Airways will shift its Dallas and Houston services from Gatwick to Heathrow and its Warsaw operation to Gatwick. Flights to Detroit and Harare will be axed. In June, the airline will also launch services between Continental Europe and New York. Operated by subsidiary OpenSkies, the daily flights will fly from either JFK or Newark to Brussels or Paris CDG using Boeing 757s from its existing fleet. In the future, OpenSkies plans to fly to other business centers, including Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Milan, Madrid, Zurich, and Geneva. BA will also commence business-only flights between New York and London City Airport next year using Airbus A318 jets in a 32-seat layout. SkyTeam Airline Alliance's new transatlantic flights starting between March 30 and June 2008 . \u2022 Air France in joint venture with Delta: daily service to Los Angeles \u2022 Continental: twice-daily service to Houston and twice-daily service to Newark Liberty International (EWR) from May 29 2008 \u2022 Delta in joint venture with Air France: daily service to Atlanta and twice-daily service to New York JFK \u2022 Northwest in joint venture with KLM: daily service to Detroit, daily service to Minneapolis and daily service to Seattle. Slots were secured as a result of Air France ditching four daily rotations from London to Paris Charles de Gaulle and KLM dropping three of its slots to Northwest from Eindhoven and Rotterdam. Non-aligned airlines . Aer Lingus launched services from Dublin to Washington DC, Orlando and San Francisco last year. This followed agreement between the Irish and U.S. governments that the airline could begin operations before others. Low-cost airline Ryanair is considering setting up a separate long-haul carrier that would fly ultra-low-fares between secondary airports in Europe and U.S. such as Stansted and Baltimore-Washington International. Virgin Atlantic has decided to wait to see if Open Skies Phase II is adopted before starting new flights to New York from non-UK cities.

According to local media reports, more than 60 people have committed suicide across Japan in the last month by mixing detergent and other chemicals, and inhaling the hydrogen sulfide gas that results. A passerby discovered the bodies of the three men in Tamioka, north of Tokyo, police said. In western Japan, police found a 21-year-old man with a plastic bag over his head Monday. A police officer in Suma, where the body was found, said authorities found detergent containers by the foot of the man. They suspect the man may have inhaled the toxic gas after mixing them in the bag. Earlier this month, police in Japan had asked Internet service providers to take down the recipe for the detergent mix. Even before the spate of recent   suicides, Japan had one of the highest rates of suicide in the world. In early May, police evacuated about 350 people from their homes on the island of Hokkaido after a neighbor mixed detergent and chemicals to kill himself. The two most recent cases did not require the evacuation of the neighborhoods where they occurred. In some cases, officials had to order residents to leave because the resulting gas from the detergent mix can sicken people.

Iraqi and U.S. troops conduct a joint patrol Monday in the northern city of Mosul during a push against insurgents. Also, the U.S. military said it killed an al Qaeda in Iraq leader in northern Iraq. The violence erupted as a peace agreement was taking hold in Baghdad's Sadr City, for weeks the scene of battles between Iraqi security forces and Shiite militias. A suicide bomber exploded his vest outside the house of an Awakening Council leader, Sheikh Mutleb al-Nadawi, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Baquba in Diyala province, the military command in Diyala said. Al-Nadawi was in the house and escaped injury, but a 7-year-old was killed and two of al-Nadawi's bodyguards were wounded. Awakening Councils are the U.S.-backed Sunni groups that oppose al Qaeda in Iraq. A mortar round landed on a busy outdoor market in Balad Ruz, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Baquba. Three civilians were killed, and nine were wounded. A bomb exploded Tuesday inside a minibus in southeastern Baghdad's Rustumiya district, killing two passengers and wounding five, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. Insurgents also attacked a minibus filled with police recruits Monday in Baaj, a Nineveh province town near the Syrian border, killing 11 people, according to Mosul police. Iraqi security forces arrested 15 people in connection with the attack. Backed by U.S. soldiers, Iraqi forces have been conducting an offensive against al Qaeda in Iraq in Mosul and the rest of Nineveh province. American-led coalition troops killed a senior al Qaeda in Iraq leader east of Samarra in northern Iraq on Tuesday, the U.S. military said. Meanwhile, the agreement forged to end the weeks of fighting in the capital's Sadr City is taking hold, government officials and witnesses said. Thousands of soldiers and police officers have moved deep inside the restive neighborhood without resistance from Shiite militia members who have been fighting Iraqi and U.S. troops. The troops have been clearing mines and soon will begin the process of confiscating weapons, officials said. No violence has been reported in the area since Monday. Much of the earlier fighting involved the Mehdi Army militia of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and security forces dominated by a rival political party, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. The latter is the leading party in the government's United Iraqi Alliance bloc. The agreement, hammered out between the United Iraqi Alliance and the Sadrists, is intended to clear the neighborhood of weaponry and outlaws and restore stability to the area. Tahseen al-Sheikhly, civilian spokesman for Baghdad's security plan, said there has been great cooperation among residents, Sadrist supporters and government forces. Gen. Qassim Atta, the military spokesman of Baghdad's security plan, said Tuesday that checkpoints and patrols have been established and coalition forces are ready to help Iraqi troops, but they have not entered Sadr City. Elsewhere in Baghdad, the trial of Saddam Hussein-era officials Tariq Aziz, Ali Hassan al-Majeed -- also known as Chemical Ali -- and six others resumed Tuesday. They are facing charges in connection with the executions of 42 Iraqi merchants in 1992.

His athletic grace has won him fans wherever he has performed, and his dedication to the art continues to bring ballet to new audiences. Capable of soaring leaps and flawless turns, Tetsuya \"Teddy\" Kumakawa has thrilled audiences the world over. Founded in 1998, his K-Ballet company has built on the success he acheived at the Royal Ballet in Covent Garden, London. Born in Sapporo on Hokkaido -- Japan's North Island -- in 1972, Kumakawa took up ballet after seeing his eight year-old cousin, Hironao perform at school in Sapporo. Like any 10 year old boy, his new hobby had to compete with other activities -- he also enjoyed kendo, baseball and drawing -- but it was ballet that he really fell in love with. From a young age Kumakawa had been keen to see the world and the arrival of foreign guest tutors at his school only reinforced those desires. But it was Swiss ballet teacher Hans Meister's visit to Hokkaido that proved to be a turning point in Kumakawa's nascent career. Meister encouraged him to travel and recommended that he attend the Royal Ballet School (RBS) in London or the Canadian National Ballet School. Kumakawa was just 15 years old when he left home to take up a place at the RBS. Less than two years later, in January 1989, he won both the Gold Medal and the newly established Prince Takamado Prize at the prestigious Prix de Lausanne in Switzerland. He was without question the star of the competition, producing soaring leaps in a performance from 'Don Quixote'. In the spring of 1989 he turned professional, becoming the first Asian dancer to join the Royal Ballet Company (RBC) -- his first solo part was the leading mandolin player in \"Romeo and Juliet.\" In June he won the Classical Ballet Prize at the Eurovision Young Dancer of the Year competition held in Paris. Kumakawa experienced a meteoric rise through the ranks of the RBC. He quickly became a Soloist, dancing the Act 1 pas de trois in Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake' and completed a memorable performance as the Bronze Idol in La Bayad\u00e8re -- a cameo role that showcased his extraordinary jumping ability. The following season he was chosen for the role of the Fool in the premiere of Kenneth Macmillan's 'The Prince and the Pagodas'. In 1991 he was promoted to First Soloist and was a Principal dancer by 1993. So developed a mutual love affair between Kumakawa, his new fans and his adoptive city. \"I was so pleased to participate in British culture,\" he told The Japan Times in 2004. By the age of 26 'Teddy', as he had become known to his friends in the UK -- 'kuma' means 'bear' in Japanese -- had danced the full repertoire of classical and modern roles at the RBC. The man who had wowed London audiences with his acrobatic jumps and audacious turns was about to leap into a new chapter of his life. In 1998 he left the Royal Ballet to found his own company -- the K-Ballet -- back home in Tokyo. It was a highly controversial move at the time. Not only had he upped sticks in the middle of a season, he also took five of the Royal Ballet's star male performers with him to Japan. The British Press and the ballet fraternity were not impressed. Greeted as a returning hero in his native country, Kumakawa took on the roles of leading dancer, teacher, artistic director and company manager simultaneously. But despite the formidable workload and responsibility the new K-Ballet flourished, fostering a wider interest in Japanese ballet. In 2004, Kumakawa established the K-Ballet School. The same year, the K-Ballet became the first Japanese ballet company to perform at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. A career-threatening knee injury, suffered whilst on a K-Ballet tour of Japan in May 2007 has temporarily sidelined Kumakawa from performing. But he expects to be back on stage next year, delighting audiences with virtuoso performances once again. In the meantime, Kumakawa -- who continues to enjoy pop star status in Japan -- continues to pass on his expertise to a new generation of dancers.

This Suffolk, Virginia, house was destroyed by an apparent tornado Monday. At least 200 were injured in Suffolk where a twister destroyed several homes and businesses, said Bob Spieldenner of the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. The storm hit the 138-bed Sentara Obici Hospital, though Spieldenner said the facility was still operational and accepting patients. A second tornado struck Colonial Heights -- about 60 miles northwest, near Richmond -- injuring at least 18 people, he said. A third twister damaged several homes near Lawrenceville, about 70 miles south of Richmond, said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, which confirmed all three tornadoes. Gov. Tim Kaine declared a Virginia-wide state of emergency as hazardous weather continued through the central part of the state.

That may be true, but the characters who've held the job are definitely worth a few good pages of trivia. Join mental_floss in toasting seven backup plans that made this country great. 1. Chester Arthur: James Garfield's V.P. Chester Arthur took office under the thickest cloud of suspicion. As a lieutenant in Senator Roscoe Conkling's political machine, Arthur held one of the most lucrative positions in government: collector for the port of New York. For seven years, Arthur raked in approximately $40,000 annually (about $700,000 today), running a corrupt spoils system for thousands of payroll employees. With so much money and power, Arthur developed an affinity for fancy clothes and earned the nickname \"the Gentleman Boss.\" But his luck didn't last. President Rutherford Hayes eventually stepped in and fired him from the post. Even with the kickback scandal and claims that he'd been born in Canada (which should've disqualified him for the vice presidency), Arthur still managed to get elected on James Garfield's 1880 ticket. After Garfield passed away 199 days into his presidency, Arthur didn't hesitate to sign the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. Much to the chagrin of Conkling, the Act revamped civil service by effectively killing the same patronage system that made Arthur very, very rich. In cleaning up civil service, Arthur also cleaned up his reputation, and he exited the White House a hero. 2. Henry Wallace: Franklin Roosevelt's second V.P. Henry Wallace was a dedicated devotee of Eastern mysticism. While serving as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture in the 1930s, he allegedly sent his guru to Mongolia under the pretense of collecting grasses that could withstand drought. In reality, Wallace was diverting funds to help his guru hunt for evidence that Christ had visited Asia. But it wasn't Wallace's spiritual beliefs that landed him America's No. 2 job. Wallace was a big Franklin Roosevelt fan and supported his entire platform, which is why Roosevelt handpicked him as his third-term running mate in 1940. Wallace wasn't popular with the Democratic Party, but when Roosevelt made it clear he wouldn't run without him, the party acquiesced. As vice president, Wallace made many international goodwill trips. Most famously, he traveled to the Soviet Union, where he experienced a political transformation that resulted in him becoming an avowed Soviet apologist. His communist leanings did nothing for his image, especially once he became secretary of commerce under President Truman. In 1948, Wallace unsuccessfully ran for president on the Progressive Party ticket, espousing views that sounded shockingly Marxist. He even described corporations as \"midget Hitlers\" attempting to crush the labor class. But nobody can say Wallace didn't know how to own up to his mistakes. In 1952, he recanted his support of the Soviet Union in a magazine article called \"Where I was Wrong.\" By then, however, his political career was over. Wallace spent the rest of his life conducting agricultural experiments on his farm in New York. 3. William Rufus de Vane King: Franklin Pierce's V.P. William R. King was sworn into office in Cuba, becoming the only executive officer to take the oath on foreign soil. King had gone to Cuba to recuperate from tuberculosis and severe alcoholism, but it didn't work. He died in 1853 after being vice president for just 25 days. That might not be the most memorable thing about King, though. It's widely rumored that the former V.P. was homosexual. Further still, he's suspected of being James Buchanan's lover. Neither King nor Buchanan ever married, and they lived together in Washington for 15 years before Buchanan became president. Of course, King's predilection for wearing scarves and wigs only fanned the rumors. President Andrew Jackson used to call him \"Miss Nancy,\" and Aaron Brown, a fellow Southern Democrat, dubbed him \"Aunt Fancy.\" 4. Richard M. Johnson: Martin Van Buren's V.P. Despite his credentials as a war hero and a Kentucky senator, Vice President Richard M. Johnson was never accepted in Washington. Perhaps that's because he dressed like a farmhand, cursed like a sailor, and made no secret of his three black mistresses, who were also his slaves. The first mistress bore him two daughters before she passed away; the second tried to run off with a Native American chief, but Johnson captured and resold her; and the third was the second one's sister. Johnson attempted to introduce this third mistress into polite society, but the couple wasn't well-received. With the support of Andrew Jackson, Johnson landed the vice presidency under Martin Van Buren in 1836. After four years of public relations disasters, Jackson withdrew his support. Nonetheless, Van Buren kept Johnson on his ticket, and the two lost their re-election bid in 1840. 5. Aaron Burr: Thomas Jefferson's V.P. No story on vice presidents would be complete without Aaron Burr -- best known for shooting and killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel in 1804. After the incident, Burr went back to presiding over the Senate. From there, he plotted a treasonous conspiracy to become emperor of the western United States and Mexico. The plan could have worked, but one of Burr's co-conspirators ratted him out. He was tried in 1807 before the Supreme Court, which found him not guilty, mainly because he hadn't actually committed the treason yet. A free man, Burr turned his sights on Florida. He went to France and tried to convince Napoleon Bonaparte to help him conquer the swampland, but that plan foundered, too. Although his political high jinks often failed, Burr consistently found success with the ladies. After his wife died in 1794, Burr remained a bachelor for 40 years, making the acquaintance of several eligible socialites. He enjoyed flirtations with Philadelphia debutantes, as well as a widow named Dolley Payne Todd -- later known as Dolley Madison, wife of James Madison. At age 76, Burr married a wealthy widow of ill-repute and plundered her fortune. Citing numerous infidelities on his part, she filed for divorce and was actually granted it. Unfortunately for her, it came through on the day Burr died. 6. Andrew Johnson: Abraham Lincoln's 4th V.P. Andrew Johnson took his 1865 vice-presidential oath drunk as a skunk and belligerent as hell. Having grown up dirt poor, Johnson felt the aristocracy in Washington had abused his kinfolk. Glassy-eyed and smelling of whiskey, he reminded Congress, the Supreme Court, the Cabinet, and pretty much everyone within hearing distance that they owed their positions to \"plebeians\" such as himself, then kissed the Bible and staggered away. Needless to say, his address was poorly received. The New York World opined, \"To think that one frail life stands between this insolent, clownish creature and the presidency! May God bless and spare Abraham Lincoln!\" Unfortunately, God didn't. The South surrendered six days before Lincoln's assassination, leaving Johnson to handle Reconstruction -- a job he bungled so completely that Congress moved to impeach him. Incredibly, Johnson avoided being booted out of office by just one vote. 7. John Cabell Breckenridge: James Buchanan's V.P. By all accounts, John C. Breckenridge was a Kentucky gentleman in the grandest sense. He had an impressive career as a lawyer and a representative in the Kentucky House. More notably, at age 36, he became the youngest vice president in history. But, like Aaron Burr, things took a turn for Breckenridge when he was charged with treason. In September 1861, only a few months after his vice presidential term had ended, Union and Confederate forces invaded his home state of Kentucky. Breckenridge cast his lot with the Confederates, and the federal government promptly indicted him. Breckenridge headed south and became Jefferson Davis' secretary of war. But when the Confederacy surrendered in 1865, Breckenridge was forced to go on the lam. He hid for the next two months in Georgia and Florida before escaping to Cuba. Breckinridge, his wife, and their children spent the next four years in exile, wandering through Canada, England, Europe, and the Middle East, until President Andrew Johnson issued a General Amnesty Proclamation on Christmas in 1868. The following March, Breckenridge returned to the country with his family, but his name wasn't officially cleared until 1958, when a Kentucky circuit court judge dismissed his indictment.

Dr. Albert Reiter, who treated Kerstin, is confident Kerstin will make a full recovery in time. She and other children who were held captive for years are slowly adapting to modern life, they said. Kerstin Fritzl, whom doctors placed in an artificial coma after she was admitted to a hospital in April for multiple organ failure, is now well enough to speak, stand and walk with assistance, her doctors said. Doctors said that \"little novelties\" such as seeing a cloud go by are now big events for the former captives. Kerstin has said she wants to see the ocean and go to a concert by British singer Robbie Williams, said Dr. Berhold Kepplinger, director of the clinic where the family is living. He described how excited Kerstin was to hear Robbie Williams songs in her hospital room and said she was moving around to the music so much that doctors had to quiet her down. It was then, Kepplinger said, that doctors became confident Kerstin can become fully healthy and develop normally. Her immune system has improved, and she is continuing to have physiotherapy, including strengthening exercises, he said.  Watch doctors describe what happened when the teen opened her eyes \u00bb . The two parts of her family -- those who were locked in a basement, like Kerstin, and those who lived above ground, apparently unaware of the abuse of their mother and siblings -- are getting to know each other again, the doctors and the family's lawyer said. \"We are so glad that things have turned out so positively so far,\" said lawyer Christoph Herbst, who appeared at a news conference at a hotel near Amstetten, west of Vienna, where Kerstin and her family are recovering. Kerstin is the oldest daughter of an incestuous relationship between Elisabeth, 43, and Elisabeth's father, Josef Fritzl, 73, according to police. He is awaiting trial. Police say he confessed to holding Elisabeth captive since 1984 and raping her repeatedly, fathering seven children with her. Six of the children survived. Kerstin fell unconscious in April, and Elisabeth convinced her father that she needed urgent medical attention. Kerstin was admitted to a hospital in Amstetten, where staff grew suspicious and called police, who opened an investigation and uncovered the abuse. Kerstin was suffering from kidney, lung, and liver failure when she arrived at the hospital, said Dr. Albert Reiter, director of the hospital. Doctors were able to turn her health around, but they kept her in a coma with artificial respiration for weeks, he said. Doctors started reducing Kerstin's medication May 12, allowing her to emerge from the coma, he said. Three days later, she opened her eyes and smiled at her carers, he said, and doctors were soon able to take the breathing tube from her throat. Her mother was at Kerstin's bedside regularly, and doctors credited that with helping Kerstin's health improve. On Sunday, Kerstin finally met with other family members and was able to say hello to them, he said. Kerstin and the rest of the family were also able to move into an apartment at a regional clinic nearby. \"It was a special moment where, walking, we were able to support her and cross the threshold into a new house and into a new life,\" Reiter said. Kerstin and two of her brothers, ages 18 and 5, had spent their entire lives trapped in the cellar with their mother, never seeing daylight. A television was their only contact with the outside world. The other three children Josef Fritzl fathered with Elisabeth were taken as infants to live above ground with Fritzl and his wife, who says she had no idea her daughter was being held captive. In recent weeks, the wife and the three children have had several meetings with Kerstin and the others formerly held in the basement. The doctors said that all are receiving therapy and are getting to know each other. \"It is clear that [the two sides] have a different temper of life,\" Kepplinger said. \"These different ways of living, the two parts of the family, still have to come to some agreement.\" Still, the entire family is \"very happy\" to be reunited, Herbst said. \"This is an incredible drawing-near to each other. There is incredible joy among them,\" he said. \"It is wonderful to see the way they are living together.\" He appealed to the public and the media to give the family privacy. There continues to be \"big ambivalence\" about the \"grandfather issue,\" as Kepplinger called it, and therapists are helping the family members cope with the complicated relationship they have with each other and with Fritzl, who is now behind bars.", "da894eb6e5cc104f90ac65e8a124bfcfbfc6578d": "In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Keith Oppenheim is covering the controversy in Irving, Texas over authorities' efforts to find illegal immigrants. IRVING, Texas -- I certainly don't think I look like a cop. With a blue blazer, and scruffy khakis I take into the field, I have that look of a reporter who's trying to dress up just enough to be professional, but no more. Protesters in Irving, Texas, demonstrate against a program that checks the immigration status of anyone arrested. So, it came as a surprise to me when I learned some Latino men, day laborers who were standing around and hoping to get some work, thought I was a federal immigration officer. \"You thought I was from immigration?\" I asked one. \"Si\", the man replied. My producer, Patricia Pedraza, translated the rest. \"The fear is with both immigration and the police. Now you cannot trust absolutely anybody.\" In Irving, Texas, a Dallas suburb of about 200,000 people, right next to the big airport, an estimated 40 percent of the city is Latino, and anecdotally, we're told there are a lot of undocumented workers here, people who are in the U.S. illegally, but clearly don't view themselves as criminals. \"They take innocent people, they think we're all the same,\" another undocumented worker told me. The fear is a reaction to what's called the Criminal Alien Program. Since September of last year, Irving police started to refer anyone arrested in their community to federal authorities, who check their immigration status. \"It's only for people who have violated Texas laws, and are arrested and brought into the Irving jail,\" said Larry Boyd, Irving's police chief. As a result, referrals for deportations have shot up to 1,600, more than 40 times the number from the year before. Statistics from police show that while some of those referrals were for people who committed serious crimes, the majority were a result of misdemeanors and traffic warrants. Many sources told me that a growing number of Latinos here are afraid to drive. The risk is being caught with a suspended license, going to jail and getting deported.  See the effect the program has had on Irving \u00bb . But if some in the Latino community are lying low, advocates for immigrants are speaking out -- accusing the city and police of targeting Latinos without cause. \"We believe the Criminal Alien Program is fundamentally wrong,\" says Carlos Quintanilla, an activist. \"That there is racial profiling going on.\" The city's mayor, Herbert Gears, disagrees. He says police are not taking on the role of immigration officers. \"We will make sure people are being treated fairly,\" he said. \"That people aren't being pulled over because of the color of their skin.\" As I spent more time in Irving, I came to realize that outside the large Latino community, there is broad support for the program. \"You have to start somewhere,\" said Sheik Shah, an Irving resident who emigrated to the U.S. from India and is now an American citizen. \"Because right now, we have so many loopholes for people to come in here and work illegally.\" Some were more direct. I read from two tall stacks of printed e-mail addressed to the City Council, which were overwhelmingly supported the Criminal Alien Program. One read: \"Please help deport all illegals. What part of illegal do they not understand?\" Another: \"Thank God some people are doing something about this invasion.\" In the end, Irving is in the middle of a profound disagreement, between those who feel it's wrong to refer people to immigration authorities for nonviolent crimes and misdemeanors, and those who believe illegal immigration has gone too far -- that something has to be done. As Irving City Council member Beth Van Duyne told me: \"We need to know who is in our city. If you're committing a crime, we need to know who you are. I don't think that's too much to ask.\" E-mail to a friend .", "b7697e424512e656efe5f2aca17bc33cfe0a2b20": "(CNN) -- An Ohio distributor is recalling about 6 million Chinese-made tire valve stems after concluding that some of them were improperly made and could increase the risk of accidents. An Ohio distributor is recalling 6 million Chinese-made car tire valve stems. Tech International, the part's Johnstown, Ohio-based distributor, estimates that just 8,600 of roughly 6 million of those valves are defective. The valve is a replacement snap-in tire valve -- Model No. TR413 -- manufactured between July and November 2006. It was imported by Tech International from manufacturer Shanghai Baolong Industries Co. in Shanghai, China, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. According to the recall, the rubber part of the valve may crack after being in use for about six months, causing a gradual loss of tire pressure. Continuing to drive on underinflated tires can cause them to burst, possibly leading to crashes. Tech International told the NHTSA that the company doesn't have records of the final purchasers of the valve stems. According to the company, the defect was identified after \"a small number\" of the valves were reported by customers and one distributor to have failed. The samples were shipped to China, and, in March, Baolong concluded that some valves could be defective. \"The cause of the defect is likely improper mixing of the rubber compound in the manufacturer's facility,\" Tech International wrote in a letter to the transportation safety authority.", "2292d4348e59aafbe93f3040af23fdff448a6cac": "(InStyle.com) -- It takes a truly adventurous actress to pull off a razored Mohawk, a platinum pixie and a Louise Brooks bob, but we'd expect nothing less from the ever provocative Selma Blair, who experimented with all three looks in under a year. Selma Blair says she works with hairstylists and makeup artists who \"have a vision.\" \"I have no fears when it comes to my hair or clothes,\" proclaims the 36-year-old star of NBC's upcoming mom-and-daughter sitcom \"Kath and Kim\" and July's action flick \"Hellboy II: The Golden Army.\" Makeup, however, is an entirely different matter for the self-declared \"poor applier,\" who sticks with basics like nude lipstick and pink blush, and ducks whenever she sees a liquid liner. \"I avoid anything difficult,\" she says. Blair's signature look: \"A rosy cheek, a smudgy eye, a lot of mascara--I look like a doll that has too much makeup on, and I love it!\" Have you always been a beauty chameleon? In high school I would mess with my hair and makeup all the time. I used to wear a shirt that said \"Ms. Clairol\" because I changed my hair color so much. I was blond for a long time, then what my mom called \"barnyard red.\" Do you still dye it yourself? Only when I have to cover up stray grays. And I'll just use whatever color I find in the grocery store that looks good on the box, like Preference by L'Or\u00e9al--because I'm worth it [laughs]. But for my platinum hair, I went to Sheri at Rom\u00e1n Salon in L.A. She was a saint. I had just dyed my hair dark brown, so she had to very slowly strip out all the color so that my hair wouldn't burn off. And the cut--are you keeping it short? I tend to like my hair whatever way it's not, so now I miss it being long. I think I'm more approachable with long hair. When it's short, I come across as being artsy and weird. What's your typical makeup look? I used to wear a lot of red lipstick, and when I got a pimple, I'd cover it up with eyeliner to turn it into a beauty mark. But everything has changed since I hit 35. I'm at an age where any makeup that's meant to look \"slept in\" really looks like I slept in it. That's for youngsters! Now less is more. I don't like to wear concealer or anything. I'd rather have uneven skin than feel like my face is cracking from too much foundation. Then you must be serious about your skin care. I go to a spa in L.A. called Kinara for its Skin Care BootCamp. You go once a week for 12 sessions and they'll look at your skin and tell you how to get it in better condition. They really helped me a lot. I also stay out of the sun. Any thoughts on Botox or plastic surgery? I wanted to get Botox once to make me feel younger. But I don't really have [enough wrinkles] to justify it yet. As for going under the knife, I can't say I wouldn't, but I haven't thought too much about it. Best beauty product? Egyptian Magic cream is my saving grace for everything. It works for my friend's baby's bottom, and I can also use it instead of Chapstick. So what's next? I'm really excited about having a perma-tan and wearing long highlighted hair extensions for my role on \"Kath and Kim.\" And I've been gaining weight for the part by eating a little bit more of what I want and not moving around as much. I've already put on 15 pounds, and I'll probably gain another 10. It'll be a whole new me! Will this be your most drastic transformation?

A south Sudanese soldier keeps watch, with the threat of civil war still high in the war-torn country. The census is a key component of a 2005 peace agreement that ended a 22-year civil war which killed 2 million people and displaced an estimated 4 million others. The war pitted a government dominated by Arab Muslims in northern Sudan against black Christians and animists in the south. Delays in starting the census were among the reasons cited when southerners withdrew last year from a government of national unity. They rejoined the government two months later, but tension and occasional fighting near the disputed territory of Abyei has threatened to reignite the civil war. \"God forbid, that's a distinct possibility,\" said Andebrhan Giorgis, senior policy adviser for Africa for the International Crisis Group, a non-profit organization that seeks to prevent and resolve crisis. \"It's quite worrisome.\" North-south tensions have worsened even as international attention has focused more on persistent violence in the Darfur region of western Sudan, where roughly 300,000 people have been killed since 2003 in a campaign of killing, rape and displacement that the U.S. calls genocide. Results from the national census, which began Tuesday, will be used to establish electoral districts and determine political representation in a national assembly, Giorgis said. \"It's an important milestone,\" he told CNN on Wednesday. The  U.N. peacekeeping mission in Sudan also hailed the census as vital, in a statement Tuesday. The census is key to establishing voting districts in advance of national elections scheduled for 2009. It is also critical in determining how oil wealth is to be shared between the north and south, who have a history of animosity and mistrust. It's unclear how census-takers will operate in Darfur - and how accurately they will be able to count the population there, Giorgis said.

Police attempt to secure a street in Naivasha, where violence flared on Sunday. The violence spread to the Rift Valley town of Naivasha on Sunday, where the Red Cross said there were reports of people being burned alive in their homes. Kenya's main opposition party and the Red Cross said as many as 30 people were killed. Ethnic killings continued in the nearby Rift Valley town of Nakuru, where another 47 people have died since the latest wave of violence began on Thursday, according to the opposition Orange Democratic Movement. The opposition death toll is much higher than police figures, which do not include Sunday's violence in Naivasha. Police say 31 people have died in the Rift Valley region since last Thursday.  Watch CNN's Zain Verjee report on the violence \u00bb . In a statement released Sunday, ODM leader Raila Odinga condemned reports of 30 people being burned alive in their Naivasha homes and blamed the Kibaki government for fomenting the violence in the region. \"I condemn this murderous and evil act in the strongest terms possible,\" he said. \"What is now emerging is that criminal gangs, in a killing spree, working under police protection, are part of a well-orchestrated plan of terror.\" It is a dramatic turn of events, considering Odinga was shaking Kibaki's hand three days ago after the two met under the auspices of former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Many had hoped Thursday's meeting, arranged by Annan who is mediating peace efforts, would bring an end to the outbreak of bloody ethnic battles that followed last month's contested presidential vote. But it seems to have had the opposite effect. Odinga blamed Kibaki's government for orchestrating the Rift Valley violence \"to try to influence mediation efforts\" and \"to divert (attention) from election malpractice to security and violence.\" \"After stealing the elections from Kenyans, Kibaki now wishes to deny them justice and peace,\" Odinga said. A Red Cross official said the agency had received reports of a non-Kikuyu family burned to death in their house in Naivasha. Television footage showed a man in the back of a police vehicle covered in blood with a large machete wound on the side of his head. Kenyan police dispersed large gangs and cleared rocks littering the streets of the lakeside town, which is dominated by Kikuyu. Tree branches, heavy boulders and oil drums littered the streets of Naivasha's town center as the Kikuyu gangs erected temporary road blocks, CNN correspondent Zain Verjee reported. She said the atmosphere was tense as the gangs checked cars to identify rival tribes. Verjee said there was a heavy police presence on the outskirts of the town. Some shops remained open but the town center was almost deserted except for the roaming gangs. It was a similar situation in Nakuru on Sunday, where ODM member the Rev. Mike Brawan said members of the Kikuyu tribe \"are flushing out the non-Kikuyus from their houses.\" He said Kikuyus are going house-to-house, attacking civilians who are not members of the tribe, as well as looting and burning their property. Police, he said, \"are not doing much.\" Brawan said he saw homes burned and people hacked to death in the violence. \"They just die with a lot of pain,\" he said. It is estimated -- depending on the source -- that between 500 and 1,000 people have been killed in the violence that followed the December 27 election in which Kibaki kept his post. Odinga, the OMD candidate for president, and his supporters claim the election was rigged. International observers noted some irregularities in the voting. Fighting, centered in western Kenya and Nairobi's slums, broke out between tribes loyal to Kibaki and Odinga after Kibaki was declared the winner of recent elections. E-mail to a friend .

Air India has strict weight parameters that all attendants must meet. When they don't, the airline grounds them. Her employer, Air India, says she is too fat to fly. Joshi, 50, has been an air hostess -- as they are still called in India -- for the national airline for 26 years. But she's been grounded because the airline has done away with its wiggle room on weight. Until two years ago, Air India allowed an attendant's weight to vary within 6.6 pounds (3 kilograms) of a specified limit. It has since put in place strict weight parameters that all attendants must meet. When they don't, the airline grounds them without pay until they shed the excess pounds. The airline says that someone who is Sheila's age, height and weight should weigh 143 pounds (65 kilograms). She misses the mark by 5 pounds. \"It's very demoralizing,\" Joshi told CNN. \"And ... it's quite humiliating.\" \"Weight is always on my mind,\" she added. \"They can tell you, 'You look overweight. Please go.'\" Joshi and 12 other grounded attendants sued the airline for weight discrimination. Air India fought back, saying the employees knew the job requirements when they signed up and didn't express concern.  Watch airline defend its position \u00bb . Furthermore, it said, appearance and physical fitness are vital parts of an attendant's job. \"(A) safety concern is also there,\" said Air India's lawyer, Rupinder Singh Suri. \"Because it's a high action job. And in case of emergencies, the person has to accelerate and move at a very, very fast pace.\" Weight used to be a consideration for airlines in the United States, as well.

Now \"most airlines want candidates with weight proportionate to height,\" according to the U.S. Labor Department's Occupational Outlook Handbook. In the India case, the airline hasn't deemed any of the attendants medically unfit -- just over the weight limit.

Patrick Mueller, left, and Swiss goalkeeper Diego Benaglio battle for the ball with Arda Turan of Turkey. Arda Turan scored with a deflected effort in the third minute of time added on to set up a Group A finale against the Czech Republic on Sunday to determine who takes the second quarterfinal place behind Portugal. The Turks came from behind after Hakan Yakin gave the Swiss a 32nd-minute lead, with substitute striker Semih Senturk heading a 57th-minute equalizer through the hands of goalkeeper Diego Benaglio. The St Jakob Park stadium had been flooded by a deluge early in the match, with the downpour continuing until just before half-time. The treacherous conditions made defending a nightmare for both teams, and Arda almost put Turkey ahead in the 29th minute with a farcical effort. With minimal visibility in the heavy rain, Benaglio punched a vicious free-kick by stand-in captain Nihat Kahveci onto the head of the 21-year-old winger -- but the ball bounced to safety off the outside of the post. However, it was the Swiss who adapted the better and they took the lead through the veteran Yakin. He was on hand to awkwardly steer home from close range with his weaker right foot after Eren Derdiyok -- who like Yakin is of Turkish origin -- beat the offside trap to collect a long pass from defender Philippe Senderos. Derdiyok calmly check inside the defense in the penalty area and sent a low cross towards Yakin -- who had to wait anxiously at the far post as the ball was held up in a huge puddle of water. Yakin had earlier been denied by Turkey goalkeeper Volkan Demirel, who also did well to tip a swerving free-kick by Tranquillo Barnetta around the post. Yakin also missed an even easier chance than the goal he scored in the 34th minute when he stabbed the ball wide of the post following a superb right-wing cross by Valon Behrami which cut out the defense and goal custodian. Turkey, sensing a lucky escape, came out after the break with renewed purpose and posed a greater threat as the pitch slowly drained of the excess water. Semih justified his second-half introduction when he rose highest to meet Nihat's superb inswinging cross from the left flank, and Benaglio could only palm the powerful header into the back of the net. Tempers flared as both sides went in search of the victory, but there was no repeat of the violent scenes that followed Switzerland's World Cup playoff victory against the Turks in November 2005. Volkan made another superb save from Yakin, and Turkey held off the Swiss onslaught before Arda cut in from the right and fired a shot from just outside the penalty area which clipped the heels of Patrick Mueller and looped over the helpless Benaglio. \"I did wish for rain to stop. I did pray to God for that,\" Turkey coach Fatih Terim told reporters. \"We couldn't predict mud in the middle of the summer. \"It's not easy to come back from a goal down at the European Championship, considering we hit the woodwork once. But we fought a lot in the second half and we created many opportunities.\" He added: \"Tonight we reminded everyone a little bit about Turkey. Against the Czech Republic, we will be unforgettable.\" Defeat was a bitter blow for Switzerland, whose fellow co-hosts Austria will also be eliminated on Thursday if they lose to Poland in Vienna. \"Of course the disappointment is huge,\" Switzerland coach Koebi Kuhn said. \"But I can't blame it on any player or anyone else.

Gyanendra came to power in 2001 following the assassination of King Birendra and his family. Ex-King Gyanendra, 60, made remarks to reporters before departing the Narayanhiti royal palace in Kathmandu. He will live as a civilian in the former Himalayan kingdom that was made a republic last month, and he will reside in a summer palace on a forested hilltop outside the capital. A few hundred journalists crammed into the opulent palace's lobby entrance to hear Gyanendra's remarks. It was a chaotic and undeferential scene replete with pushing, shoving and scuffling -- even while the former monarch was speaking. While the former king spoke, reporters looked around at the lavish furnishings, including a huge crystal chandelier, stuffed tigers, stuffed rhino heads mounted on the walls and paintings of previous monarchs. Gyanendra, who expressed his \"love\" for \"independent Nepal,\" said all of his property will remain in the country and that he has no property outside the nation. \"I have no intention or thoughts to leave the country,\" he said. \"I will stay in the country to help establish peace.\" The monarchy's end after 239 years of rule was the culmination of a two-year peace process in which Maoist insurgents in Nepal gave up their armed struggle, joined mainstream politics and won the most seats in April's election for the Constituent Assembly. The assembly is tasked with rewriting the constitution, deciding the country's future political system and governing the nation. Gyanendra, who noted that the country is going through a \"serious\" stage now, said he accepts the new reality of a republic and reflected on the actions of the monarchy. \"I have done all I can to cooperate with (the government's) directives,\" he said, and added that \"the monarchy in Nepal has always been with the people of Nepal in good times and bad times.\" Gyanendra came to power in 2001 when his brother, King Birendra, and his family were massacred in the palace by the crown prince, who later shot himself. Gyanendra on Wednesday denied rumors that he had played a role in that event. The ex-monarch also discussed events of 2005, when he he took over the civilian government to take on the Maoist insurgency, an unpopular move that sparked protests. He said he hopes people \"understand\" he didn't intend to infringe on any of the rights of the people. He left the palace by a side entrance with pro-royalists and pro-republicans gathered outside to see his departure. His car had to stop momentarily as journalists took pictures of him. Gyanendra's royal scepter and a crown of peacock feathers, yak hair and jewels remain in the palace and have been handed over to the government. -- From CNN's Dan Rivers and Manesh Shrestha .", "186210bbc060c272ff9a2412ec2e711a3e4a5e6e": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Nothing says true love like releasing a caged butterfly, don't you think?

Ivicia Olic celebrates Croatia's second goal in their superb 2-1 victory over Germany. Darijo Srna and Ivica Olic struck the goals as Croatia, who had only ever beaten Germany once before, produced arguably the first major upset of  the tournament. Lukas Podolski pulled a goal back late on for Germany with his third strike in two games to set up a nail-biting finale, but there was to be no way back for Joachim Loew's team, who finished with 10 men following the 90th-minute dismissal of substitute Bastian Schweinsteiger . Both sides came into the game having won their opening matches, although Germany had looked far more impressive in seeing off Poland than Croatia had in defeating Austria. However, it was Slaven Bilic's side who turned on the style at the Worthersee Stadion as they took control of Group B with two wins out of two. A frantic start to the match promised much but for all their huffing and puffing, neither side were able to create anything resembling a chance in the opening 20 minutes as defences held firm. The ball did find its way into the back of the net in the 22nd minute when Germany striker Mario Gomez slotted home past Stipe Pletikosa but the offside flag had already gone up against the Stuttgart man. The deadlock was broken for real just two minutes after that incident though, when Croatia went ahead through Srna. Danijel Pranjic sent over a superb cross from the left and Srna nipped in front of marker Marcell Jansen to slide the ball in at the far post, giving veteran Germany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann no chance. Croatia had a gilt-edged chance to make it 2-0 in the 30th minute, but Niko Kranjcar wasted it. Ivan Rakitic chipped a pass into the area which was flicked back towards the penalty spot by Olic, but the in-rushing Kranjcar was unable to cap a well-worked move as he blazed over. Germany knew they needed to step up through the gears and they finally made Pletikosa earn his keep with two efforts in rapid succession. The first saw Pletikosa push away a thunderous Michael Ballack free-kick, before the Spartak Moscow custodian awkwardly deflected away a Christoph Metzelder effort with his knee. Metzelder then headed a Torsten Frings corner just over from close range as the Germans stepped up their efforts for an equalizer before the break. However, Loew's side very nearly found themselves two goals behind in the 43rd minute, and they needed a fine reaction stop from Lehmann to deny Kranjcar, who chested down Olic's pass and smashed in a first-time volley. Having seen his side let off the hook, Loew opted for a more adventurous approach in the second half as he sacrificed full-back Jansen for jet-heeled winger David Odonkor during the interval. Aside from a Ballack shot over the crossbar though, Croatia looked fairly comfortable at the start of the period and also had a decent effort of their own with Luka Modric firing in a shot that Lehmann gathered, although not before seeing it squirm through his hands first. However, Lehmann's next task was to pick the ball out of the back of his net as Croatia stunned the Germans with a second goal in the 62nd minute. A Rakitic cross from the right took a deflection off Podolski before arrowing goalwards and although Lehmann, who had begun to come out for the initial cross, managed to dive backwards and get a hand on it, the ball struck his near post before rebounding back out to Olic, who had the easy task of slotting home. Germany looked for an immediate response but aside from a Schweinsteiger shot that fizzed across the face of goal, they were still finding it difficult to create chances against a well-organised Croatia backline. Loew's side earned themselves a lifeline with 12 minutes to go though when Podolski lashed home a shot on the half-volley after the ball had fallen kindly to him in the box. Germany could not build on that goal, though, and their final hopes of getting anything out of the match all but disappeared when Schweinsteiger was given a straight red card for shoving Jerko Leko in the final minute of an absorbing encounter. \"I want to especially congratulate my players, not only for the fight they showed but for playing an excellent match,\" said a delighted Bilic. \"There is no other way to beat the Germans than to play well. They're still a great team, though, and still one of the favorites for the title.\" Ballack said the Germans had to recognize they must improve. \"Our movement was not fluid enough throughout the match and as a consequence we eked out few chances. \"We played below our level in all departments. Now we absolutely have to win our last match against Austria,\" said the Chelsea midfielder.", "31310358d02c98abba71916e8cb4ef7477a2d82a": "LONDON, England -- Britain's Princess Eugenie has been reprimanded by her school after being caught frolicking naked on college grounds, it was reported Saturday. Princess Eugenie is sixth in line to the British throne. The 18-year-old daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Sarah Ferguson, was apprehended for her involvement in end of term \"high jinks\" at the exclusive Marlborough College, west of London, the UK Press Association said. A royal source told the Press Association, \"It was nothing more than high jinks at the end of term in May. A group of them were reprimanded and that's the end of the matter.\" The tabloid Sun newspaper reported that a college staff member woke to playful shrieks and found several young women dancing around without clothes. It said there was no suggestion boys were present or that drugs were involved but claimed a pupil said the students had been drinking. Princess Eugenie, the sixth in line to the British throne, is studying art, history of art and English at the $46,000-a-year college, PA said. It said the princess was expected to be among guests celebrating the official birthday of Queen Elizabeth II on Saturday.

Selma Blair says she works with hairstylists and makeup artists who \"have a vision.\" \"I have no fears when it comes to my hair or clothes,\" proclaims the 36-year-old star of NBC's upcoming mom-and-daughter sitcom \"Kath and Kim\" and July's action flick \"Hellboy II: The Golden Army.\" Makeup, however, is an entirely different matter for the self-declared \"poor applier,\" who sticks with basics like nude lipstick and pink blush, and ducks whenever she sees a liquid liner. \"I avoid anything difficult,\" she says. Blair's signature look: \"A rosy cheek, a smudgy eye, a lot of mascara--I look like a doll that has too much makeup on, and I love it!\" Have you always been a beauty chameleon? In high school I would mess with my hair and makeup all the time. I used to wear a shirt that said \"Ms. Clairol\" because I changed my hair color so much. I was blond for a long time, then what my mom called \"barnyard red.\" Do you still dye it yourself? Only when I have to cover up stray grays. And I'll just use whatever color I find in the grocery store that looks good on the box, like Preference by L'Or\u00e9al--because I'm worth it [laughs]. But for my platinum hair, I went to Sheri at Rom\u00e1n Salon in L.A. She was a saint. I had just dyed my hair dark brown, so she had to very slowly strip out all the color so that my hair wouldn't burn off. And the cut--are you keeping it short? I tend to like my hair whatever way it's not, so now I miss it being long. I think I'm more approachable with long hair. When it's short, I come across as being artsy and weird. What's your typical makeup look? I used to wear a lot of red lipstick, and when I got a pimple, I'd cover it up with eyeliner to turn it into a beauty mark. But everything has changed since I hit 35. I'm at an age where any makeup that's meant to look \"slept in\" really looks like I slept in it. That's for youngsters! Now less is more. I don't like to wear concealer or anything. I'd rather have uneven skin than feel like my face is cracking from too much foundation. Then you must be serious about your skin care. I go to a spa in L.A. called Kinara for its Skin Care BootCamp. You go once a week for 12 sessions and they'll look at your skin and tell you how to get it in better condition. They really helped me a lot. I also stay out of the sun. Any thoughts on Botox or plastic surgery? I wanted to get Botox once to make me feel younger. But I don't really have [enough wrinkles] to justify it yet. As for going under the knife, I can't say I wouldn't, but I haven't thought too much about it. Best beauty product? Egyptian Magic cream is my saving grace for everything. It works for my friend's baby's bottom, and I can also use it instead of Chapstick. So what's next? I'm really excited about having a perma-tan and wearing long highlighted hair extensions for my role on \"Kath and Kim.\" And I've been gaining weight for the part by eating a little bit more of what I want and not moving around as much. I've already put on 15 pounds, and I'll probably gain another 10. It'll be a whole new me! Will this be your most drastic transformation? Actually I wore huge prosthetic boobs for a John Waters movie. They were glued on every day by a really handsome guy, but ripping them off every night was definitely outside my realm of comfort.

Lukas Podolski celebrates his goal as Germany cruised to a 4-0 victory over Cyprus. Both sides have already qualified for EURO 2008 but Germany showed no sign of letting up as Bayern Munich pair Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski struck either side of half-time to build on Clemens Fritz's second-minute opener. Thomas Hitzlsperger added the fourth in the 82nd minute as Germany claimed their eighth win in the group to move level with the Czech Republic on 26 points. Germany were quick out of the blocks and celebrated their first goal after less than 120 seconds. Podolski's determination paid off and he pulled the ball back from the goalline for Fritz to score with a far-post header. Klose added the second on 20 minutes, accepting a pass from the selfless Fritz in a central position and firing in from eight meters out. Podolski was Germany's main threat, and he finally got the goal an excellent performance warranted when he turned in Klose's low cross from the right eight minutes into the second half. The impressive Podolski turned provider for the final goal eight minutes from time, making a determined run to the goalline before squaring for Hitzlsperger, whose simple tap-in completed the scoring. Meanwhile, Arsenal midfielder Tomas Rosicky was among the goals for the Czech Republic as they beat neighbors Slovakia 3-1 in Prague to remain top of the group by virtue of their head-to-head with Germany. Germany conclude their qualifying campaign at home to Wales on Wednesday while the Czech Republic travel to Cyprus. Meanwhile, the Netherlands secured their place in the finals with a narrow 1-0 win over Luxembourg in Group G. Danny Koevermans scored the only goal for the Dutch two minutes before half time to seal their place in the finals alongside Romania -- who remain top of the group having already qualified, despite losing 1-0 to Bulgaria in Sofia. Spain beat Sweden 3-0 with goals by Joan Capdevila, Andres Iniesta and Sergio Ramos, while Northern Ireland maintained their slim chance of catching Sweden by beating Denmark 2-1. David Healy scored the winning goal to set a European Championship qualifying record of 13 goals, overtaking Davor Suker's 12-goal mark. Northern Ireland must now beat already-qualified Spain in Las Palmas on Wednesday and hope that Latvia can win in Sweden on the same night, if they are to reach the finals.

Sarah Jessica Parker was a driving force in creating the \"Sex and the City\" movie. Then came the inevitable cry: That's it? What happens next? Sarah Jessica Parker, who played Carrie, wanted to find out as well. But the situation had to be right, she said, which prompted a cascade of rumors as plans for a movie came together, fell apart and came together again. Now that the movie is out, Parker -- who's a producer of the film as well as one of its stars -- talked about the journey to making a big-screen \"Sex and the City\" with \"Showbiz Tonight\" anchor A.J. Hammer. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: I think a lot of fans, maybe a lot of people, and those of you among the cast, didn't think this day would actually ever come ... but here we are. So how are you feeling deep inside, Sarah? Sarah Jessica Parker: I feel extraordinarily privileged. I've spent the last two years cobbling this movie together. ... It's a once-in-a-lifetime kind of professional experience and one really shouldn't be greedy enough to ask for it twice.  Watch the cast talk about the thrill of \"Sex\" \u00bb . I have to say that, this last six, eight months, was better than those seven years [the show aired] and I think it's because we all recognize how lucky and unique those seven years were and that this is a story that you don't get to tell twice. It has been, I must say, worth every obstacle and dead end, and fit and start, and every moment that was seemingly impossible. It has been a dream. CNN: And I imagine sitting down for the first time in that room together for the table read, which was, from my understanding, the first time you all actually were in the same room [together] regardless of how much you kept in touch. Tell me a little bit about that moment. Parker: I started putting [the] script back together in April of 2006 ... and that [table read] was a really extraordinary day, because just the perfunctory details of getting people to a table read were complicated. Kim [Cattrall] had been away and Kristin [Davis] had been away and Chris [Noth] had been [doing] his other job, and this magnificent script had arrived and had been everything we hoped for and more. It was basically like being in an alternate universe for about three hours. ... It was a kind of reunion that is very, very special, because you really want to be there. It's not the reunion where you're forced by your parents to meet your aunts and uncles that you see rarely. It's the reunion that you want. I think even more so was that first day on [the] set. When we thought, good God, [writer/director] Michael Patrick [King] and I are actually making this movie, like we got it done, we're here, we're doing it -- what a privilege. CNN: I think we as fans and viewers actually got a sense of what that feeling was like when we saw you all together on \"Oprah,\" because the energy was ... palpable. ... But we're talking about the perceived drama around this whole project. (Rumors have abounded about friction between the stars.) One of my producers said while we were watching the TV, \"Are they going to sit near each other?\" \"Why are they putting Chris in the middle of all of them?\" Hearing that, does it make you mad? Parker: I find it slightly -- it's not that I'm mad. I expect better from people. I think it's really beneath me, to keep defending myself. I have a 35-year career. I have an impeccable character, I really pride myself in my work ethic and the way I treat people. And I think Kim would say the same and Cynthia would say the same. And I love Kim, and I wanted her to be in this movie. We couldn't have done it without her, we couldn't have done it without Kristin, we couldn't have done it without Cynthia [Nixon], nor could we have done it without Chris.  Watch Cattrall address the rumors \u00bb . You know, this is a story that people like to tell about women. Why? I don't know. Is it that interesting? Probably not. So once again I just have to say it doesn't define the experience. Nobody can take the experience away. It's far more interesting for me to talk about my affection for this cast than to start to deny a sad old beaten tale. CNN: You seem to have what goes on in the media in perspective -- and you have to, being at the game as long as you've been. To that end, one of the things that I've always admired about you and [husband] Matthew [Broderick] and I think a lot of people do, is how you've managed your public or your private life while being in the glare of the spotlight. ... Now I know one of the main reasons you guys are able to make it work is because you don't talk about your private lives, which is great and I applaud that. That said, is there something that you can tell me about what it is about your relationship that enables you to make it work separate from that? Parker: I wouldn't make any proclamations about why I have a marriage that, to me, is successful. I would just say that we've chosen to live in a city where we are not the most interesting people. This is a city that is about industry and finance and publishing and architecture and the arts and education and academia, and the movie industry fits into it in some small way, but there are a lot of people of important interest and I think that it's a conscious choice to live in a place where we're bumping up against humanity. We run to the market on our own, we take the subway, and we integrate into our city, and we become a part of the fabric and I think it's really been to our benefit and certainly to our son. Does it mean that we are not scrutinized and that we don't have paparazzi every single day at our house? No, but it is a city where you can't live behind a gate, you can't drive up in a car and be protected. You walk out the door and it is what it is. So you reconcile those things and you make the best choices you can. CNN: Is it the end of \"Sex and the City\"? What does your gut tell you? Parker: My gut tells me it's up to you and your colleagues and the critics and the people who show up. The future is dictated not by us at this point, and I think Michael Patrick and I have been so focused at getting this movie up on the big screen, that we haven't thought about the future. Doing this was more than we could have asked for. So anything beyond that is really kind of out of our hands in a perfectly wonderful way.", "aa966ac9e3611ac2cef8d3fb9ceb3b58c150e238": "(Mental Floss) -- Starting a legitimate business is hard, boring work. There's paperwork to fill out, employees to hire, and all sorts of other drudgery, not to mention the biggest hurdle of all: providing a product or service for which customers are willing to pay. President Ulysses S. Grant foiled a gold scam. In all likelihood, it would be much easier to just stumble upon some clever scam to line your pockets. Or so it would seem. As many aspiring scam artists quickly learn, when a business scam fails, it tends to fail in rather grand fashion. Just ask any of these four teams of not-so-smooth operators. A corny sea story . Xenothemis and Hegestratos may not have been the world's first white-collar criminals, but they were certainly noteworthy for their incompetence. In 360 B.C., the pair stumbled upon what seemed like a killer plan to make some quick cash. Shipping was extremely risky at the time, and boats went down at sea with alarming frequency. To exploit this uncertainty, Xenothemis and Hegestratos devised a plan in which they would receive a cash advance to ship a load of corn from Syracuse to Athens. Due to the dangers associated with shipping, the buyer would take on full risk if the shipment didn't make it to Athens, so if the boat sank Xenothemis and Hegestratos could keep their cash. Instead of loading the ship with expensive corn, the conniving pair made a plan to sail an empty ship out to sea for a few days, then sink it and escape in lifeboats. Since the boat itself was insured, this plot seemed airtight, and the potential profit was great. Unfortunately, though, the boat's other passengers allegedly caught wind of the scheme during the attempting scuttling of the ship. These passengers were understandably a bit peeved at Hegestratos' attempts to drown them for his own financial gain. Hegestratos panicked and jumped overboard, at which point he drowned. Unable to sink the ship by himself, Xenothemis had to sail on to the port, at which point the buyer, Protos, wanted to know why his shipload of corn was empty. A legal battle followed, and although the verdict has been lost by history, it's safe to say that the late Hegestratos regretted the scam. When Friday went black . Despite his prowess as a general, Ulysses S. Grant's presidency didn't go so smoothly. Ones of its most notable scandals occurred in 1869, when a group of speculators upended the U.S gold market. The plan started when financier James Fisk and robber baron Jay Gould formed a group of speculators with the goal of cornering the gold market, which would give the group the ability to manipulate the price. Of course, one can only corner the market if there's a fixed quantity of gold available. Otherwise, the government could just sell large quantities of gold, and the cornering effort would be an expensive failure. In an effort to avoid this fate, Gould and Fisk brought President Grant's brother-in-law Abel Corbin into their fold. Using Corbin's influence to get an audience with the President, the pair would argue to Grant that selling gold was a terrible idea that the government should avoid at all costs. The wily pair also used their influence at the White House to secure a position as assistant treasurer of the United States for Daniel Butterfield, who would warn them if the government started to sell gold. With their connections in place, Fisk and Gould started buying up gold in September 1869, quickly driving the price of gold up by around 30 percent. Once Grant and his advisors got wise to the situation, though, the government quickly sold off $4 million in gold to break the corner, effectively killing the inflated prices on September 24. As investors scrambled to get rid of their overpriced gold, the price plummeted sharply, and many involved in the scam lost huge amounts of money. Fisk and Gould managed to avoid big losses due to their connections in the treasury, but what would be known as Black Friday didn't earn them a huge windfall -- and significantly harmed the American economy. Bad moves . If you've ever hired movers, you know it can be pretty pricey. Erik Deri, the founder of Woodinville, Washington-based Nationwide Moving Systems, understood that most movers were expensive, so he drummed up business by offering super-cheap quotes to frugal clients. The customers were ecstatic to find a mover who could get their belongings to a new home so cheaply. That is, until the price went up. Deri's movers would load the company's vans with all of a customer's worldly belongings, then a foreman would inform the client that they'd have to pay an inflated price to actually get their stuff to their new digs. The price hikes weren't small, either; one man's estimate stated he could move for $3,000 but was later revised to $16,000 after loading. According to authorities, if customers balked at these demands, the movers would threaten to unload their boxes and furniture into the street...and then charge them an unloading fee. If things got really sticky, Nationwide's trucks could just take off with all of the clients' possessions. Deri supposedly paid cash bonuses to employees who successfully strong-armed customers into forking over the premiums. In the end, though, Deri learned that you can't scam that many customers and hope to get away with it. In 2005 he was found guilty of 27 counts of extortion and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and extortion. Three of his accomplices were also convicted in connection with the moving racket. Deri was sentenced to seven years in prison, after which he'll face deportation to his native Israel. Fools for gold . Bre-X Minerals Ltd. was a small Canadian mining company that made a big announcement in 1995. Geologists had discovered gold on a site Bre-X owned near Busang, Indonesia. Not just a little gold, either -- at least 30 million ounces, possibly as much as 200 million ounces. Given the high prices of gold, such a deposit would have been worth tens of billions of dollars. Bre-X's stock price shot through the roof; shares went from being valued at a few cents to over $280 Canadian. In fact, the deposit seemed so rich and so large that a small company like Bre-X could not possibly handle it all without some help. In 1997, the Indonesian government convinced Bre-X to take on an American firm as a partner to help extract the gold. When this firm, Freeport-McMoRan, started sampling the soil at the deposit site as part of its due diligence, it reached a confusing conclusion: there wasn't any gold in the soil. Subsequent examinations by independent auditors reached the same conclusion. The \"natural\" gold that in the original samples Bre-X had taken was mostly river gold from other regions or shavings off of gold jewelry. Although the company's market cap had climbed to $4.4 billion, this report quickly destroyed Bre-X's value. Share prices dropped 97 percent in a day following the announcement, the company was soon removed from the Toronto Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, and Bre-X quickly went bankrupt. Amazingly, no one ended up in jail from this scam, but you should still probably be wary if anyone offers to sell you an enormous gold mine on Borneo.

Dr. Albert Reiter, who treated Kerstin, is confident Kerstin will make a full recovery in time. She and other children who were held captive for years are slowly adapting to modern life, they said. Kerstin Fritzl, whom doctors placed in an artificial coma after she was admitted to a hospital in April for multiple organ failure, is now well enough to speak, stand and walk with assistance, her doctors said. Doctors said that \"little novelties\" such as seeing a cloud go by are now big events for the former captives. Kerstin has said she wants to see the ocean and go to a concert by British singer Robbie Williams, said Dr. Berhold Kepplinger, director of the clinic where the family is living. He described how excited Kerstin was to hear Robbie Williams songs in her hospital room and said she was moving around to the music so much that doctors had to quiet her down. It was then, Kepplinger said, that doctors became confident Kerstin can become fully healthy and develop normally. Her immune system has improved, and she is continuing to have physiotherapy, including strengthening exercises, he said.  Watch doctors describe what happened when the teen opened her eyes \u00bb . The two parts of her family -- those who were locked in a basement, like Kerstin, and those who lived above ground, apparently unaware of the abuse of their mother and siblings -- are getting to know each other again, the doctors and the family's lawyer said. \"We are so glad that things have turned out so positively so far,\" said lawyer Christoph Herbst, who appeared at a news conference at a hotel near Amstetten, west of Vienna, where Kerstin and her family are recovering. Kerstin is the oldest daughter of an incestuous relationship between Elisabeth, 43, and Elisabeth's father, Josef Fritzl, 73, according to police. He is awaiting trial. Police say he confessed to holding Elisabeth captive since 1984 and raping her repeatedly, fathering seven children with her. Six of the children survived. Kerstin fell unconscious in April, and Elisabeth convinced her father that she needed urgent medical attention. Kerstin was admitted to a hospital in Amstetten, where staff grew suspicious and called police, who opened an investigation and uncovered the abuse. Kerstin was suffering from kidney, lung, and liver failure when she arrived at the hospital, said Dr. Albert Reiter, director of the hospital. Doctors were able to turn her health around, but they kept her in a coma with artificial respiration for weeks, he said. Doctors started reducing Kerstin's medication May 12, allowing her to emerge from the coma, he said. Three days later, she opened her eyes and smiled at her carers, he said, and doctors were soon able to take the breathing tube from her throat. Her mother was at Kerstin's bedside regularly, and doctors credited that with helping Kerstin's health improve. On Sunday, Kerstin finally met with other family members and was able to say hello to them, he said. Kerstin and the rest of the family were also able to move into an apartment at a regional clinic nearby. \"It was a special moment where, walking, we were able to support her and cross the threshold into a new house and into a new life,\" Reiter said. Kerstin and two of her brothers, ages 18 and 5, had spent their entire lives trapped in the cellar with their mother, never seeing daylight. A television was their only contact with the outside world. The other three children Josef Fritzl fathered with Elisabeth were taken as infants to live above ground with Fritzl and his wife, who says she had no idea her daughter was being held captive. In recent weeks, the wife and the three children have had several meetings with Kerstin and the others formerly held in the basement. The doctors said that all are receiving therapy and are getting to know each other. \"It is clear that [the two sides] have a different temper of life,\" Kepplinger said. \"These different ways of living, the two parts of the family, still have to come to some agreement.\" Still, the entire family is \"very happy\" to be reunited, Herbst said. \"This is an incredible drawing-near to each other. There is incredible joy among them,\" he said. \"It is wonderful to see the way they are living together.\" He appealed to the public and the media to give the family privacy. There continues to be \"big ambivalence\" about the \"grandfather issue,\" as Kepplinger called it, and therapists are helping the family members cope with the complicated relationship they have with each other and with Fritzl, who is now behind bars.", "6c5f775006a225e617c1fa4cf0c439579e1443a2": "LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Police closed streets near London's Canary Wharf financial district on Saturday after an unexploded German flying bomb from World War II was found on a construction site.

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe says war veterans do not want the opposition in power. Mugabe -- Zimbabwe's only leader since that struggle ended in 1980 -- faces a June 27 runoff with Morgan Tsvangirai of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Mugabe told supporters that Tsvangirai would turn the country back over to white control if he won the runoff. The veterans he led in a successful effort against a government dominated by the white minority were not prepared to recognize a Tsvangirai victory, Mugabe said. \"They said they got this country through the barrel of gun, so they cannot let it go by a ballot,\" Mugabe said Thursday at a campaign rally in Murehwa. Tsvangirai was arrested twice Thursday. He was released Friday, but police impounded his two campaign buses. In the general election on March 29, the opposition won a plurality in parliament. Weeks after the election, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission announced that Tsvangirai won a plurality against Mugabe but that he failed to get the needed majority, making a runoff necessary. Human Rights Watch issued a report this week declaring the presidential election to be dead on arrival because of violence and intimidation by Mugabe's followers -- including war veterans - against opposition supporters. Mugabe, at a rally in Chikomba District -- about 120 miles (200 km) south of Harare -- seemed to support that conclusion.  Learn more about Zimbabwe \u00bb . \"These areas, where the party lost on March 29, need to be cleansed and I am confident this would be done on June 27 when we go to the polls.\" Mugabe said the MDC was a party \"for whites and not blacks.\" He also said the party was created and funded by the British. \"You saw the whites after the March elections running around thinking that they would repossess the farms,\" Mugabe said. \"They thought they had won.\" He said the opposition would not be allowed to \"give it back to whites.\" \"Guard your country jealously,\" Mugabe told supporters. Meanwhile, Zimbabwean authorities put more pressure on opposition figures Thursday, seizing a top leader and accusing him of treason. Police and the MDC confirmed Tendai Biti's arrest and the charges he will face. Biti, secretary general of the MDC, was arrested when he arrived in Harare, Zimbabwe, from South Africa. Zimbabwe's national police spokesperson Wayne Bvudzijena told CNN that Biti would be charged with treason and the communication of false information. The treason charge relates to a document published by the MDC before the March 29 vote which, the state alleges, contains subversive statements authored by Biti.", "693d73ab049f7d8f3c897922b3f7269a96a1a4fa": "(CNN) -- The Iowa Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 133rd Infantry received an emotional welcome home July 25 -- more than a year and a half after leaving for Iraq.

CNN's Don Riddell talks to the former England star about homophobia and racism in the game. Graeme Le Saux, pictured here playing for Chelsea, endured homophobic abuse throughout his career due to false rumors he was gay. Don Riddell: Graeme, you're happily married with two children but during your football career everyone thought you were gay and the experience was pretty miserable. Graeme Le Saux: The culture of football back in the 80s was very different, something I found very hard to relate to and subsequently I found myself a little bit isolated and ostracized from certain people. That eventually led to rumors being spread that I was gay. In the context of modern life that's not defamatory but in terms of the dressing room culture that existed then -- and to an extent now -- it was very difficult for me to deal with and had the potential to damage my career. I think that the joke very quickly got out of hand. And I think where I was at fault was that I was probably a little sensitive about it, because I could actually see the potential of this sort of thing to get out of control. And it did. We played in a game at West Ham and the terraces started singing something particularly defamatory about me and I remember being, you know, really, really shocked that it got to that level so quickly. DR: And that carried on as well and the most notable incident is the one involving Robbie Fowler. Tell me about that? GS: It all culminated in a game that we played at Stamford Bridge against Liverpool and Robbie Fowler, he stood in front of 40,000 people and he bent over and invited me to perform a homosexual act upon him... That's the politest way I can put it! That really was the point at which it couldn't get any worse. It wasn't just people singing on the terrace, it was a colleague -- an international colleague -- humiliating you in front of all those people, an international audience. He will maintain to this day that it was just a laugh but that is exactly the point. If you look at anything like this, whether it is racism or homophobia or whatever, as if it is just a laugh that can be a very serious issue. I'm all for a good laugh but when you offend someone and you are damaging relationships then it goes way beyond being a laugh and you can't hide behind that as an excuse. DR: It's thought that only one professional soccer player in the world has ever declared himself to be gay. That was the Englishman Justin Fashanu and he committed suicide a decade ago. John Amaechi became the first gay player to be associated with the NBA last year, but such declarations are extremely rare. In many cases homosexuality remains pro sport's last taboo. GS: It's such a terrible reflection on a sport that has so much positive impact across the globe that there is still this issue about gay people within the sport. If you look at so many other professions in terms of business and politics, across the board the gay community is represented but in football it still isn't and I find that disappointing. There may not be many gay players in the game but the sport should be grown up enough to be able to support those people in the football environment. DR: Football's obviously made great strides, certainly in Britain, in the last 10 years with regards to racism, but how much prejudice is there generally in the game? Do you think we'll ever be free of it? GS: I think there's always going to be an undercurrent of prejudice. But ultimately I think it's important for any business really to be responsible, inclusive and representative of its employees. And football is in a very privileged position and can lead by example. And so I hope that, you know, the people in authority really make some serious attempts, I suppose to create parity between all walks of life. DR: We've come across a couple of black footballers who say that fans who shout racist abuse aren't really racist, they are just trying to put us off our game. How much do you buy into that approach? GS: Well, I can't speak for individual black players! But sometimes I think the perception of people it is not happening to is different to the individual. It used to baffle me when I first started playing that you'd have Chelsea fans being racist to black players from the opposition but there would be three or four black players on the Chelsea's team. And if you spoke to them or confronted them about it, they would be like, \"Oh yeah, but we know them... they are, you know, they are fine.\" And it's like, well how do you pick the bones out of that? Because there is just no logic. But then you know prejudice is built on ignorance. You know it really is. I think that sometimes you know individuals have to take responsibility for themselves and actually take a step back and look at what they are doing and not use ignorance as an excuse and say, \"Well, would I like to be on the receiving end of this sort of abuse?\"", "53f3e11ada213ff55b987692a2eb0c9b6d890d5e": "KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepal's new government has converted its deposed king's opulent palace into a museum and unfurled the national flag on Sunday as a symbolic move to signify the end of monarchy. The Narayanthi Royal Palace has been converted into a museum. \"The national flag is fluttering in the hands of the people in the royal palace now,\" said Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala at a ceremony at the former palace Sunday. Ex-King Gyanendra, 60, left Narayanhiti Royal Palace on Wednesday. He will live as a civilian in a summer palace on a forested hilltop outside the capital. Gyanendra's departure came following the declaration of the former Himalayan kingdom as a republic last month. The monarchy's end after 239 years of rule was the culmination of a two-year peace process in which Maoist insurgents in Nepal gave up their armed struggle, joined mainstream politics and won the most seats in April's election for the Constituent Assembly. The assembly is tasked with rewriting the constitution, deciding the country's future political system and governing the nation.

Kassar is accused of conspiring to sell weapons to FARC rebels. Monzer al Kassar had been wanted for decades before he was arrested in an undercover operation in Spain last year. Justice Department officials say he has been a source of weapons and military equipment for armed combatants since the 1970s. He left Spain aboard a private plane accompanied by U.S. Drug Enforcement Agents and arrived in New York at 11:30 a.m. local time Friday (1530 GMT), a DEA spokesman said. He is expected to appear before a federal magistrate in Manhattan before the end of the day. Kasser was arrested in Madrid a year ago by Spanish police working with undercover DEA officers posing as members of the FARC. The U.S. accuses Kassar and two other men of conspiring to sell millions of dollars' worth of weapons to FARC, which the United States has designated a terrorist organization. The weapons included surface-to-air missile systems, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, thousands of machine guns, and millions of rounds of ammunition, according to a federal indictment. A Spanish court last week approved his extradition on four counts, including conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals. The two co-defendants, Tareq Mousa Al Ghazi and Luis Felipe Moreno Godoy, were both previously extradited to New York from Romania to face the same terrorism charges. All three could face life in prison. Kassar had told journalists before he was arrested that he had retired from arms dealing, but the U.S. says he had been involved since the 1970s, providing weapons and military equipment to armed factions in Nicaragua, Cyprus, Bosnia, Croatia, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, and elsewhere.

Cindy McCain has a master's degree in special education. She is part owner of her father's business. It's not like deciding whether to press the nuclear button, but first ladies in the United States can wield enormous influence in politics and in society. They're not elected. They're not paid. There's no precise job description. But whether it's an elegantly dressed Jacqueline Kennedy giving Americans a tour of the White House, Eleanor Roosevelt speaking on civil rights or Hillary Clinton saying \"I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies,\" first ladies are praised, criticized, adored and scorned -- but never ignored. The two women poised for the job, 54-year-old Cindy McCain, wife of Republican Sen. John McCain, and 44-year-old Michelle Obama, wife of Democratic Sen. Barack Obama, come from strikingly different backgrounds.  Watch the different styles of potential first ladies \u00bb . McCain is the only child of a wealthy Arizona businessman, James Hensley, founder of Hensley & Co., a major distributor of Budweiser beer. Her stake in the business is estimated to be at least $100 million. She refused to release her full tax returns, saying \"I am not the candidate,\" but later provided summary pages of her 2006 taxes without details. Cindy McCain has a master's degree in special education. She met John McCain in 1979 when he was the U.S. Navy's liaison to the Senate. He was 18 years older than she. He divorced his wife and married Cindy in 1980. The McCains have four children, including a daughter adopted from an orphanage in Bangladesh. A tall, striking blonde with blue eyes, Cindy McCain has had health issues including a near-fatal stroke in 2004 and a battle with prescription drugs that she says is behind her. In an interview with CNN, McCain said her priority in life is charity. \"I've been internationally involved in many, many things,\" she said. \"Land mine removal, children's health care, poverty around the world -- and I will continue that.\" On the campaign trail, always dressed impeccably, she stays \"on message\" but did take a swipe at Michelle Obama after her statement, \"For the first time in my adult lifetime, I'm really proud of my country.\" \"I don't know about you,\" McCain said in February, \"...I'm very proud of my country.\" Michelle Obama has a blunt style and a wry, quirky sense of humor that goes over well with supporters. She doesn't mince words. In an interview with CNN, she said, \"I think race is always -- still, in this country, it's always on the table.\" Michelle Obama was raised in a working-class family in Chicago, Illinois, but educated at some of America's elite universities: Princeton and Harvard Law School. She was hired by a top-flight law firm in Chicago and met Barack Obama when she was assigned to mentor him. They married in 1992 and have two young daughters. Michelle Obama cuts an impressive figure -- tall, slim and dressed in Jackie-Kennedy-like sheath dresses. If her husband is elected, she will make history as the first African-American first lady. She has given insights into her husband's domestic behavior: He doesn't pick up his socks. Cindy McCain praises her husband as a fighter who won't give up. Will we learn more of substance?

Residents surround Lt. Tobey Harrison at a Cedar Rapids checkpoint as they wait to see their homes Sunday. \"We've had the [National Guard] working next to prisoner inmates, sandbagging,\" said David Jackson, the university's facilities manager. \"Students, faculty and staff, leaders of the university, the president of the university -- out sandbagging.\" Some 500 to 600 homes were ordered to evacuate and others faced a voluntary evacuation order through the morning, said Iowa City Mayor Regenia Bailey. The Iowa River in Iowa City crested at 31.5 feet and was expected to remain at that level until Monday, city and state officials said Sunday. Classes at the university have been suspended until next Sunday, according to its Web site. \"All of our theaters, our music building, Clapp Recital Hall, our fine arts building [the] new Art Building West designed by Stephen Holl, has taken on significant water as well,\" said Sally Mason, president of the university. \"Fortunately we were able to save all the art,\" she said. The art was placed in crates shipped out of state last week. \"We anticipated the worst a week ago.\" At least 8 feet of water rushed through the campus, officials said.

People lined up for about a block in one part of the city waiting for a special wristband to allow them access to their homes. The flooding there caught many people by surprise. \"We didn't think it would get this high,\" said Tina Fleischacker, whose Cedar Rapids home was soaked. \"We moved everything upstairs and it's gone. It's gone. We left with the clothes on our backs.\" About 36,000 Iowans, most in Cedar Rapids, evacuated their homes due to the state-wide flooding.

She urged residents to be careful when returning to their homes and businesses, and asked them to abide by a 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. \"Water flows are still dangerous,\" she said. \"We need people to be patient. We will get them into those homes and businesses as soon as possible.\" Iowa has been inundated with heavy rains in recent weeks that have caused several major rivers that feed into the Mississippi -- including the Cedar, Des Moines and Iowa Rivers -- to flood their banks. The flooding in the Midwest is \"some of the worst\" to hit the United States since Hurricane Katrina inundated the Gulf Coast nearly three years ago, FEMA administrator David Paulison said Sunday on CNN. The scenarios are much different, but \"the aftermath is similar,\" he said. \"The fact [is] that we have a lot of people whose homes have been destroyed.\" The agency has received more than 12,000 disaster assistance applications from the hardest-hit states -- Iowa, Indiana and Wisconsin.

The agency, which is housing 720 flood victims in 30 shelters, plans to spend about $15 million on Midwest relief efforts. Iowans are very concerned about how they will afford to rebuild. \"Most of the people here ... do not have flood insurance,\" said Steve Doser, director of a shelter in Cedar Rapids. \"A couple people told us ... that they were told they didn't need flood insurance, 'Don't worry about it, you're in a 500-year [plain],' \" he said. \"Now they don't have anything.\" Iowa Gov. Chet Culver estimates agricultural damage could reach $1 billion, exceeding the costs of the big flood in 1993. He praised the strength and resilience of the people of Iowa and vowed to rebuild the state, noting that \"will take a long time.\" There have been 16 storm-related deaths since May 25 in Iowa, 12 of them from recent tornadoes, Culver said Sunday. Four Boy Scouts were killed last week when a twister touched down at a camp in Iowa. Culver has declared 83 of the state's 99 counties disaster areas.

A New Orleans charity keeps goods in trash bags in an empty church. FEMA never told it about the free items. \"We still have quite a few left if Louisiana needs those,\" David Paulison said. \"But we did find out, we did ask Louisiana, 'Do you want these?' They said, 'No, we don't need them.' So we offered them to the other states.\" A CNN investigation revealed last week that FEMA gave away 121 truckloads of material the agency amassed after 2005's Hurricane Katrina. The material was declared surplus property and offered to federal and state agencies -- including Louisiana, where groups working to resettle hurricane victims say the supplies are still needed. Paulison told CNN's \"Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer\" his agency distributed more than 90,000 \"living kits\" to people in Louisiana whose homes were destroyed or damaged by Katrina. The kits included cleaning supplies, mops, brooms, pots and pans. After CNN reported on the giveaway, Louisiana officials asked that the supplies be redirected to the state, which originally passed on them. John Medica, director of the Louisiana's Federal Property Assistance Agency, told CNN he was unaware Katrina victims still needed the items because no agency had contacted his office. Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, an outspoken critic of FEMA's response to the hurricane, told CNN the supply giveaway was \"just a shame.\" \"It's just another example of the failings of the federal bureaucracy,\" said Landrieu, who wrote Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff last week to request an explanation. \"We're still trying to fix it. It's going to take a lot more work.\" Paulison said much of the stockpile included \"things we don't normally store -- refrigerators, stoves, coolers, diapers, things like that.\" States, meanwhile, were requesting those items, he said. \"It didn't make any sense for FEMA to sit on this much stuff and supplies we normally don't even keep. We have plenty of supplies in place if we have another disaster. We can duplicate that type of commodities and get them for people in need,\" he said. The agency's chief spokesman, James McIntyre, had declined a request for an on-camera interview and told CNN the giveaway was \"not news.\" Paulison said the story \"just really missed the mark\" -- that the supplies given away were not exclusively for Katrina victims, but were \"donated from disasters all around the entire country.\" But e-mails from McIntyre and from the General Services Administration, which manages federal property, contradict Paulison's account. In an e-mail sent in April, McIntyre told CNN \"in many cases, items were purchased in the field by FEMA.\" And in a phone interview with CNN, McIntyre said, \"That is property that was purchased in response to Katrina. We purchased most of that equipment because of the catastrophic nature of that disaster.\" General Services Administration spokeswoman Viki Reath wrote the supplies given away were \"surplus from the Katrina and [hurricane] Rita disasters... some purchased by FEMA, some donated by foreign countries and federal government agencies.\" McIntyre said FEMA's storage costs were running more than $1 million a year, and that GSA officials wanted to tear down the Fort Worth, Texas, warehouses in which the stockpiles were being kept.

A U.S. serviceman with his dog watches a detainee at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq in 2003. The Massachusetts-based Physicians for Human Rights reached that conclusion after two-day clinical evaluations of 11 former detainees, who had been held at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and in Afghanistan. The detainees were never charged with crimes. \"We found clear physical and psychological evidence of torture and abuse, often causing lasting suffering,\" said Dr. Allen Keller, a medical evaluator for the study. In a 121-page report, the doctors' group said that it uncovered medical evidence of torture, including beatings, electric shock, sleep deprivation, sexual humiliation, sodomy and scores of other abuses. The report is prefaced by retired U.S. Major Gen. Antonio Taguba, who led the Army's investigation into the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in 2003.  Watch why a rights group says there's evidence of torture \u00bb . \"There is no longer any doubt that the current administration committed war crimes,\" Taguba says. \"The only question is whether those who ordered torture will be held to account.\" Over the years, reports of abuses at Abu Ghraib and allegations of torture at Guantanamo prompted the Bush administration to deny that the U.S. military tortures detainees. Since only 11 detainees were examined \"the findings of this assessment cannot be generalized to the treatment of all detainees in U.S. custody,\" the report says. However, the incidents documented are consistent with findings of other investigations into government treatment, \"making it reasonable to conclude that these detainees were not the only ones abused, but are representative of a much larger number of detainees subjected to torture and ill treatment while in U.S. custody.\" Four of the men evaluated were arrested in or taken to Afghanistan between late 2001 and early 2003 and later were sent to Guantanamo Bay, where they were held for an average of three years before being released without charge, the report says. The other seven were detained in Iraq in 2003 and released within a year, the report says. All the subjects told examiners that they were subjected to multiple forms of torture or ill treatment that \"often occurred in combination over a long period of time,\" the report says. While the report presents synopses of the detainees' backgrounds based on interviews with them, the authors did not have access to the detainees' medical histories. Therefore, there's no way to know whether any of the inmates may have had medical or mental problems before being detained. Among the ex-detainees was an Iraqi in his mid-40s, identified only as Laith, whom U.S. soldiers took into custody in October 2003 and who was released from Abu Ghraib in June 2004. According to the report, Laith was subjected to sleep deprivation, electric shocks and threats of sexual abuse to himself and his family. \"They took off even my underwear. They asked me to do some movements that make me look in a very bad way so they can take photographs. ... They were trying to make me look like an animal,\" Laith told examiners, according to the report. According to the report, Laith said the most \"painful\" experiences involved threats to his family: \"And they asked me, 'Have you ever heard voices of women in this prison?' I answered, 'Yes.' They were saying, 'Then you will hear your mothers and sisters when we are raping them.' \" The examiners concluded in the report that \"Laith appears to have suffered severe and lasting physical and psychological injuries as a result of his arrest and incarceration at Abu Ghraib prison.\" Another detainee, Youssef, was detained by U.S. soldiers nearly seven years ago when he tried to enter Afghanistan from neighboring Pakistan without a passport, the report says. He initially was held in an Afghan prison, where he describes \"being stripped naked, being intimidated by dogs, being hooded and being thrown against the wall on repeated occasions,\" the report says. A few months later, he was taken to the Guantanamo Bay facility, where he was subjected to interrogators who would enter his cell and force him to lie on the floor with his hands tied behind his back to his feet, the report says. Youssef said the interrogators wanted him to confess of involvement with the Taliban, the report says. Based on its investigation, the report calls on the U.S. government to issue a formal apology to detainees subject to torture and ill treatment by the military since fall 2001 in Afghanistan, Iraq, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. The rights group also demands that the Bush administration: . \u2022 \"Repudiate all forms of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment\"; . \u2022 Establish an independent commission to investigate and report publicly the circumstances of detention and interrogation at U.S.-run prisons in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay; . \u2022 Hold individuals involved in torturing detainees accountable through criminal and civil processes; and . \u2022 Monitor thoroughly the conditions at U.S.-run prisons all over the world.

While most of the attacks do not result in casualties, three Israelis have been killed in rocket and mortar strikes in recent weeks. The Israeli military responds to the attacks by carrying out airstrikes and ground operations in Gaza that target militants, but many times lead to civilian casualties -- further inflaming the Palestinian leadership. Israel also has restricted supplies of gasoline, diesel and electricity to Gaza, limited the amount of food and other goods entering the strip and made it virtually impossible for manufacturers and farmers in Gaza to export anything to the outside world. Hamas seized control of Gaza last year after routing Palestinian security agencies under the control of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah movement. The ouster forced Abbas to dissolve the Fatah-Hamas unity government, but Fatah still controls the West Bank. Representatives from the rival factions met recently in Senegal for talks aimed at restoring the political and territorial split. Earlier this month, Abbas called for \"national unity\" talks with Hamas with the goal of producing new elections for the Palestinians, who elected a Hamas-led Palestinian Authority government in a U.S.-backed vote in 2006. Meanwhile, Abbas' Western-backed government is working toward a peace agreement with Israel. The Bush administration has said it wants the two sides to reach an agreement by the end of the year.

Barack Obama Monday proposed spending billions to revitalize the nation's economy, a plan the campaign of his likely Republican opponent said would slow economic growth with higher taxes. Sen. Barack Obama wants to spend $60 billion on America's infrastructure. During an economic speech in Flint, Michigan, Obama promised to spend billions to improve America's education, infrastructure, energy and health care systems. To improve America's competitiveness, the senator from Illinois said he wants to spend $10 billion on childhood education, $150 billion over 10 years on developing alternative energy and $60 billion over 10 years to build \"21st century infrastructure.\" Obama said he would pay for these programs by ending the war in Iraq, reducing government waste, charging polluters for greenhouse gas emissions and ending the Bush tax cuts for wealthy individuals. During his speech in Michigan, a state hard hit by the decline of the American automobile industry, Obama also rejected protectionist trade polices that many unions say would help protect American jobs, saying \"it is impossible to turn back the tide of globalization.\"   Watch Obama call for America to compete in the global economy \u00bb . Obama said he disagreed with those who want to \"build a fortress around America; to stop trading with other countries, shut down immigration, and rely on old industries.\" \"Not only is it impossible to turn back the tide of globalization, but efforts to do so can make us worse off,\" Obama said. \"Rather than fear the future, we must embrace it. I have no doubt that America can compete -- and succeed -- in the 21st century.\" A McCain spokesman attacked Obama's plan, saying the Democrat's \"agenda to raise taxes and isolate America from foreign markets will not get our economy back on track or create new jobs.\" \"To help create jobs in America, we need to lower taxes and open up foreign markets to American goods,\" said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds. \"Americans cannot afford Barack Obama's 'change' that takes us back to the failed policies of the past.\" But Obama said now was the time to commit to long-term investments in America's future and blasted McCain for wanting to continue President Bush's economic policies, saying \"there is a clear choice in this election. Instead of reaching for new horizons, George Bush has put us in a hole, and John McCain's policies will keep us there. I want to take us in a new and better direction. \"I reject the belief that we should either shrink from the challenge of globalization or fall back on the same tired and failed approaches of the last eight years,\" he said. \"It's time for new policies that create the jobs and opportunities of the future -- a competitiveness agenda built upon education and energy, innovation and infrastructure, fair trade and reform.\" The two campaigns have been sparring over who would be a better steward of America's ailing economy, and both candidates have been reaching out to blue-collar voters, many of whom backed Republican President Ronald Reagan over the Democrats, in part, because of cultural issues. \"I believe that there are stark differences between myself and Sen. Obama. ... And I believe that the same appeals that President Reagan made to the so-called Reagan Democrats will succeed there,\" McCain said during a campaign stop in Arlington, Virginia.  Watch McCain vow to win Reagan Democrats \u00bb . A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Thursday suggested voters favor Obama over McCain to handle the economy 50 percent to 44 percent.

Michel refereed the 2003 UEFA Cup final when Jose Mourinho's Porto beat Celtic. Michel, 40 last week,is remembered by Chelsea fans for controversially awarding a goal to Liverpool against the Londoners in the semifinals of the 2005 competition. Chelsea's manager at the time Jose Mourinho always insisted that Luis Garcia's shot did not cross the line. Michel is regarded as one of the top referees in the world and officiated at Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup, including the tense Germany v Argentina game in the first knock-out round. He also refereed the 2003 UEFA Cup final when Mourinho's Porto triumphed over Celtic. Michel speaks English, Russian, German and Polish as well as his native language. Michel will be supported at the Luzhniki Stadium by the assistant referees who have partnered him at major tournaments - Roman Slysko (34) and Martin Balko (36). The fourth official will be Vladimir Hrinak (44), also from Slovakia. Meanwhile, senior police officers from Manchester traveled to Moscow on Monday to help prevent fan violence from marring the final. Manchester police will serve in an advisory role as Russian authorities prepare for Wednesday's match. \"A number of my officers and I have flown out to Moscow to meet local police and help draw up arrangements to police the fixture,\" said chief superintendent Janette McCormick. \"Although GMP officers have no powers of arrest abroad and ultimate responsibility for policing the game lies with the Russian authorities, we have been gathering intelligence on potential and known troublemakers and GMP officers will be in Moscow in an advisory role,\" McCormick added. As Manchester United flew out on Monday, plain-clothed intelligence officers were stationed at Manchester Airport to target known or potential troublemakers from heading to the Russian capital. Ban orders imposed on fans with soccer-related convictions will be rigorously enforced in the next two days to prevent them from flying to Moscow. \"As with all operations like this, we are sending out a clear message to people intending to travel to commit violence to think again,\" said police chief inspector Robert Tinsley, who is based at the airport. The airport is expecting 20,000 more passengers than usual to be flying to Moscow. The British embassy in Moscow have announced that their consular section will stay open on May 21 and 22 to help English fans arriving for the final. \"The consular department will extend their working hours on Wednesday and Thursday to support English citizens coming here to watch the Champions' League final,\" the embassy press service said.

Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen is far from happy after Lewis Hamilton  pushed him out of the Canadian Grand Prix. Hamilton's McLaren rammed into the back of world champion Raikkonen's Ferrari as the Finn and Robert Kubica, the race's eventual winner, were waiting at a red light after the safety car was forced into action on lap 17. Raikkonen, while claiming not to be angry, was clearly far from impressed. \"There's not much I can say. My race was ruined by Hamilton's mistake. \"Obviously, anyone can make mistakes, as I did two weeks ago in Monaco, but it's one thing to make a mistake at 200 hundred [miles] per hour but another to hit a car stopped at a red light. \"I'm not angry because that doesn't achieve anything and does not change my result. I am unhappy because I had a great chance of winning.\" Raikkonen, who has failed to score points in the previous two races, said he had to start winning again. \"There is still a long way to go in the championship and it is still very close and we have everything we need to regain the ground we have lost.\" Ferrari team sporting director Stefano Domenicali said Hamilton had made a \"serious mistake.\" \"I think the penalty imposed by the FIA [Hamilton was given a 10-place grid penalty for the French Grand Prix at Magny-Cours] is in line with it, even if it does not restore what was a lost opportunity for us. \"Kimi was in an excellent position to fight for the win\" Hamilton, for his part, was apologetic. \"I don't know what happened to be honest,\" Hamilton said. \"I was comfortably in the lead, it was looking like an easy win. Then I went in for the pit stop. It was not a good stop and I saw the two guys in front of me battling in the pit lane. \"I saw the red light but by that time it was a bit late. It was not exactly a racing incident as such, it was unfortunate. It was one of those things. It is different to if you crash into the wall and you are angry. It is not like that.

In 2006 over one million Britons visited the United Arab Emirates, according to the UK Foreign office. The alert, posted on its Web site, urged Britons in the oil-rich Gulf kingdom to be vigilant -- especially in public places -- because of a \"high threat of terrorism.\" The UAE is among the most moderate Gulf states and is home to thousands of expatriates. \"We believe terrorists may be planning to carry out attacks in the UAE,\" the Foreign Office statement read. \"Attacks could be indiscriminate and could happen at any time, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travelers such as residential compounds, military, oil, transport and aviation interests.\" By Monday, the U.S. State Department had not issued any warnings about the UAE. The UAE, slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Maine, is in the midst of a building boom to position itself as one of the world's premier tourist destinations. It is already home to the world's largest mall, the world's largest tower, and -- despite being in the Middle East -- boasts the largest indoor snow park in the world. According to the British Foreign Office, more than a million British visitors traveled to the UAE in 2006, while over 100,000 British nationals live there.

Residents of Gladstone, Illinois, work with the National Guard to create a makeshift levee. \"I'm not moving, not moving my business,\" said Byron Sebastian, a longtime resident of Gladstone, Illinois, who also serves on the city council. \"We've got a lot of good people here helping to try to save this part of town.\" Gladstone is one of many towns under threat Tuesday after rising waters breached a 300-foot area of a levee near Gulf Port, Illinois, before 5 a.m. Levees all along the mid-Mississippi were being topped with sandbags Tuesday as the river, fed by its flooded tributaries, continued to rise. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich called up 1,100 National Guard members to assist in sandbagging efforts, said Patti Thompson of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. She also said inmates are helping on the levees and others are bagging sand in correctional institutions. \"We were very, very disappointed that this levee broke today,\" said Thompson. \"It's a very powerful river, and it can be hard to harness.\" With the help of the National Guard, Sebastian and his fellow residents hustled Tuesday to build a barrier between Gladstone and the encroaching floodwaters. Even though Gladstone is about four miles from the banks of the Mississippi, the rising floodwaters have submerged homes and created rivers where crop fields once stood. The muddy townspeople worked with anxious resolve, cracking the occasional joke, as they filled bags with sand and dirt and loaded them onto ATVs. On the receiving end were members of the Illinois National Guard, who piled up the sandbags as the tops of cornstalks rose above the waters behind them. \"Threats can happen in all shapes and forms, so we are trying to help out,\" said National Guardsman Capt. Lanny Finn, whose unit previously served in Iraq. \"We'll be here for as long as we're needed.\" Sebastian, who lived through floods in 1993, said he never thought he'd have to experience them again. \"We thought that was bad, but this is a lot worse than it was in '93,\" said Sebastian. \"Now we got some lakefront property.\" Elsewhere in Illinois, authorities closed the Great River Bridge on U.S. 34, which connects Illinois to Iowa over the swollen Mississippi, as authorities evacuated about 400 people in Henderson County. The sheriff of Henderson County, where the Mississippi River borders the entire western edge of the county, said authorities are still concerned about the communities of Gulf Port, Carman, Lomax and Dallas City.  Watch aerial views of the rising Mississippi \u00bb . \"It's been an uphill battle from the start, and the levee just broke loose,\" he said. Sheriff John Jefferson of Hancock County, Illinois, said water was \"very, very close\" to the top of some areas of the county's two levees. \"We've had to evacuate some areas already, but the areas that have not been evacuated yet, we're just keeping our fingers crossed and hoping that the levee will hold,\" he said. In two of the county's communities, Rio Vista and Pontoosuc, power has been shut off in all but 20 residences, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's office said. Missouri also began to feel the force of the surging Mississippi Tuesday, as water began to top multiple levees east of Highway 79, forcing authorities to suspend sandbagging efforts at a levee near Foley, officials said Tuesday. In Northwest Missouri, towns and cities along the Mississippi River were bracing for flooding later this week as swollen waters head downriver. Communities at high risk of record flooding include Quincy, Illinois, and Hannibal, Missouri, according to National Weather Service modeling. Moderate flooding is possible later in the week in Alton, Illinois, and St. Louis, Missouri. The floods began heading downriver Monday to Illinois and Missouri, relieving Iowa somewhat after two weeks of natural disasters that killed 17 people, displaced 38,000 and caused more than $1 billion in crop damages. \"The good news is the floodwater is receding in much of the state,\" said David Miller, administrator for the Iowa Homeland Security and Emergency Management Division. \"The bad news is we're still in a flood fight.\" President Bush said he and a team will travel to Iowa this week. State and federal officials also plan to meet there this week to decide the best way to house displaced residents, said Bill Vogel, a federal coordinator with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In Washington, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa said the flooding has devastated his state's corn crop. Floods prompted farm-equipment manufacturer John Deere to idle two plants in Waterloo, Iowa, he said.  Watch a farmer boat through his fields \u00bb . \"Across eastern Iowa, the flooding rivers have washed out railroad lines; Mississippi barge traffic has come to a halt and [flooding has] closed major roadways,\" said Harkin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. \"Thousands of Iowa businesses, large and small, have been impacted.\" Harkin said Iowans \"are a resilient and resourceful people,\" but will need \"generous federal assistance\" to recover. FEMA has set up six disaster recovery centers in Iowa and has provided nearly $4 million in assistance, state and federal officials reported. So far, 24 counties are under federal disaster declarations, making residents eligible for individual aid, Lt. Gov. Patty Judge reported. By Tuesday afternoon, residents of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where the Cedar River inundated more than 400 city blocks, were beginning to return home as the rivers lessened, said Lu Barron, a Linn County supervisor. \"We're doing pretty good,\" she said. \"People are getting into their businesses, and getting into their homes.\" she said. She estimated that thousands of people had returned to their homes after authorities inspected them to make sure they were safe. The death of one woman whose body was found in her car Monday was determined unrelated to the floods, said Courtney Greene, a spokeswoman for the governor's office and the state Emergency Operations Center. Amtrak service from Chicago, Illinois, to St. Paul, Minnesota, and to Kansas City, Missouri, was disrupted by the flooding.

World-renowned security expert Gavin de Becker says this weapon exists, but you already have it. He calls it \"the gift of fear.\" One chapter in Gavin's book \"The Gift of Fear\" has stuck with Oprah since she first read it. The story of a woman named Kelly begins with a simple warning sign. A man offers to help carry her groceries into her apartment -- and instantly, Kelly doesn't like the sound of his voice. Kelly goes against her gut and lets him help her -- and in doing so, she lets a rapist into her home. \"We get a signal prior to violence,\" Gavin says. \"There are preincident indicators. Things that happen before violence occurs.\" Gavin says that unlike any other living creature, humans will sense danger yet still walk right into it. \"You're in a hallway waiting for an elevator late at night. Elevator door opens, and there's a guy inside, and he makes you afraid. You don't know why, you don't know what it is. Some memory of this building -- whatever it may be. And many women will stand there and look at that guy and say, 'Oh, I don't want to think like that. I don't want to be the kind of person who lets the door close in his face. I've got to be nice. I don't want him to think I'm not nice.' And so human beings will get into a steel soundproof chamber with someone they're afraid of, and there's not another animal in nature that would even consider it.\" For weeks, Nicole had a funny feeling that something odd was going on in her apartment. \"My gut started feeling like something just wasn't right,\" she says. \"I would come home, and there would be just weird lights on in my house -- lights that I didn't even remember turning on in the first place.\" Then one day, Nicole noticed a UPS delivery box where it shouldn't be. \"I'm like, 'How did this brand of box get on my back balcony?'\" Nicole began to feel uneasy -- but continued to brush it off. \"I would just come home, you know, and almost feel nauseous,\" she says. \"I kept trying to justify it saying, 'Okay, it is in my head.'\" Nicole's funny feeling eventually escalated into full-fledged panic attacks, which Gavin says were her intuition's way of telling her that something was wrong. \"And intuition records everything. So when she started getting panics attacks, her intuition is saying, basically, 'You're not going to listen? Okay, I'll ramp it up. I'll give you panic attacks. You want sleepless nights? I'll give you sleepless nights.'\" Nicole eventually did listen to her intuition, starting with a simple test. \"I dropped a tank top behind the door as I was leaving for work, thinking that when I come home that night, I'm going to peek my head around the corner. If [the tank top] had been pushed to the side, it would have been obvious that the door was opened.\" When Nicole got home, she says the tank top had moved. Caught on camera . The next day, Nicole says she set up a hidden camera to try and find out what was going on in her apartment. Once she came home, Nicole says she plugged the camcorder into her laptop. \"And the first thing I see is this man's head peeking around the corner into my house,\" she says. \"What I felt at that point was just complete terror. I'm sitting there watching this video --this story unfold -- and this person comes in my house, is looking around, going through my things, looking through my laundry, holding up my lingerie.\" As Nicole continues to watch in horror, the intruder undresses himself and puts her lingerie on. \"So this person is in my clothes, proceeds to start pleasuring himself -- just very, very graphic things happening right there in my house with my belongings. And he finishes up, takes off my clothes -- and puts them exactly back as I had left them -- puts his clothes back on, checks to make sure nobody's outside the door and leaves.\" After watching the tape, Nicole says she ran around her apartment, screaming hysterically. She says she had never seen the man in the tape before. \"Initially, I took my cell phone, called my boyfriend at the time, screaming hysterically. All I could say was, 'He's in my house. He's in my house.' Even picking up the phone, dialing, was difficult.\" Two weeks later, police found the man -- 39-year-old Shawn Rogers, a computer consultant with a young son and a wife at the time. Police were unable to charge Rogers with anything more than trespassing ... until he came back to Nicole's apartment to steal her camera. Police were able to charge Rogers with burglary, and he was sentenced to eight years in prison. Dangerous behavior . When Nicole found the UPS box on her balcony, Gavin says this was a warning sign. Gavin applauds Nicole for listening to her intuition and says that quieting her fear could have caused the situation to escalate. \"He's already into behavior of wanting to get caught,\" he says. \"You don't come back again and again and again and not want to get caught.\" Gavin says like Nicole, the intruder's intuition was probably trying to tell him something too. \"Offenders as well can see what's happening in their lives. And talk about not listening to it -- he's in someone's apartment doing something sexual with their clothes on -- that's something to listen to.\" Because the intruder had a job and a family, Gavin says his behavior was not only reckless, but dangerous as well. \"When people do listen, they can stop what's almost fate,\" Gavin says. \"There's a great line that Carl Jung said. He said, 'What we do not make conscious emerges later as fate.' If he made it conscious, if he could talk to someone about it, if he could tell someone, he could get better also. But he didn't, and it does mean escalation. If she discovered him, that's dangerous. If he came in when she was there, that's dangerous.\" Your feelings are warnings . Doris, who says she endured years of sexual abuse at the hands of her husband, appeared on \"The Oprah Show\" after leaving her husband. Unfortunately, her battle didn't end there -- two months after she left him, Doris's ex-husband abducted her at gunpoint and raped her. After the show, Oprah spoke with Doris again to ask if her she had sensed any warning signs the night she was abducted. \"As I was coming home from work, it was just a very eerie, strange feeling as I drove up,\" Doris says. \"It was darker than normal in my driveway, and there was a trash can sitting where I normally park right in the middle. \"I thought, 'Hmm, this is strange.' Because my mother lives with me, and she'll turn on the lights when it gets dark. It did give me a little eerie feeling -- the hairs on the back of your neck kind of stand up. But still, I didn't listen to my instincts.\" Gavin says that \"eerie feeling\" is exactly what he wants women to pay attention to. \"We're trying to analyze the warning signs,\" he says. \"And what I really want to teach today and forever is the feeling is the warning sign. All the other stuff is our explanation for the feeling. Why it was this, why it was that. The feeling itself is the warning sign.\" From \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" Subscribe to O, The Oprah Magazine for up to 75% off the newsstand price. That's like getting 18 issues FREE. Subscribe now!

Jo-Ann Burrows believed for years that her son had been cremated before making the grim discovery about his fate. The mother-of-five is now taking legal action against the hospital authorities in Hampshire, southern England, the UK's Press Association reported Thursday. PA reported that Ms Burrows had daughter Ellie in April 2004 at the Hythe Birthing Centre, in Hampshire, but gave birth to the stillborn twin two days later at home. She said that an ultrasound scan taken the previous December had not revealed that she was carrying a twin, according to PA. After the stillbirth, Ms Burrows, 44, was taken to the Princess Anne maternity hospital in Southampton, also in southern England, where she gave her consent for the body to be cremated. PA reported that she has spent the past four years asking for the funeral papers and ashes. The 44-year-old is now organizing a naming ceremony and funeral for the stillborn, whose twin sister survived. Ms Burrows was quoted in her local newspaper, the Southern Daily Echo, as saying: \"This experience has made me suicidal, if it wasn't for my friends and family I wouldn't be here. \"I kept asking for my baby's funeral papers because I was always worried that he might be in a jar somewhere. I still couldn't believe it when I found out.\" She was informed through her solicitor in February that the hospital still had the baby and has now filed a medical negligence claim against Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust. It claims the Trust failed to \"exercise reasonable care and skill when performing the ultrasound and also focuses on Ms Burrows' repeated requests for confirmation of the cremation,\" PA reported. A Trust spokeswoman told the news agency: \"Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust confirms that legal proceedings have been brought against it by Ms Jo-Ann Burrows. \"The chief executive has already written to Ms Burrows apologizing for shortcomings in the treatment provided to her and, in particular, for the circumstances which led to Ms Burrows' second twin not being cremated in 2004 as they had previously advised and for the distress this discovery may have caused.\"", "7f22fbc4fd81e50c632c5853856965aa4d0065d4": "(CNN) -- Andre Berto claimed the vacant World Boxing Council welterweight title when he halted Miguel Rodriguez in the seventh round in Memphis.

Khan said: \"This was one of my toughest fights but I learned from my mistakes. I will watch the video and work on them and continue my journey to the world title.\" Khan was on target with a powerful right uppercut in the first round and a combination of punches floored Gomez, who retaliated in the second round. A left hook over the top of a jab put Khan down and he had to take a standing count and looked unsteady on his legs for several seconds afterwards. Gomez landed a damaging hook to the ribs in the fourth but early in the fifth Khan put his opponent down again with a powerful body shot. Gomez began to take a lot of punishment and referee John Keane stopped the contest.

Michelle Obama's spokeswoman, Katie McCormick Lelyveld, said earlier there is no \"image makeover\" in the works.  Watch what Michelle Obama would be like as first lady \u00bb . \"She has staff engaged in simply part of the process of growing to a general election campaign and putting a strategy together to help people get to know her,\" Lelyveld said. \"It's what you do as you move from primary voters to general election voters.\" Carl Sferrazza Anthony, a first ladies historian, said it's important for Michelle Obama to define herself before others define her. \"One comment made off-hand ... might be easily misinterpreted by the opposition,\" he said. Michelle Obama saw that in February when a Republican ad used a snippet from a campaign event in which, referring to record voter turnout in the Democratic primaries, she said, \"for the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country.\" Obama's campaign says she was just excited about the grassroots support, but her words still provided fodder for her husband's opponents. The day after the comments, Cindy McCain, wife of presumptive Republican nominee John McCain, introduced her husband saying, \"I don't know about you, if you heard those words earlier -- I am very proud of my country.\" Michelle Obama has been a vocal advocate for her husband while on the campaign trail, delivering sometimes impassioned speeches on his behalf. Robin Givhan, fashion editor with the Washington Post, said people see Michelle Obama in different ways. \"Some people will see confidence, and others might see cockiness. I think some people will see strength. Others might see arrogance,\" she said. \"She comes across as someone who is extraordinarily independent and very much a force to be reckoned with.\" Behind the scenes, she maintains that independence. According to the campaign, Michelle Obama picks out her own clothes. She received a lot of attention for the sleeveless purple dress and pearls she wore the night her husband became the presumptive Democratic nominee. Beyond her style, though, a sense of dignity may be what most defines a first lady. It's a job that requires the ability to strike a balance between queen and commoner. Exactly how Michelle Obama refines her approach on the stump remains to be seen, staffers said. \"We'll see,\" Jarrett said. \"She's learned a lot of stories along the way from the American people, I think she may incorporate some more of the stories that she's heard that resonate with what she's seeing in terms of the direction that people want the country to take. But the rest is up to her. We'll see what she comes up with.\" CNN's Randi Kaye contributed to this report.", "732304a0901ff14d023d4361c1d41a85724808f3": "Brazilian coach Zico is leaving Turkish club Fenerbahce, after failing to reach an agreement over a new contract.

Tina Watson, background right, lies motionless after she drowned in 2003 while diving in the Great Barrier Reef. An Australian coroner ruled Friday that there was enough evidence to put Gabe Watson on trial for the death of Tina Watson, who was 26 when she drowned in October 2003 while diving around a historic shipwreck in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Watson, 31, told police that his new bride appeared to panic 45 feet underwater and that he \"looked into her eyes and saw her eyes were wide open, but there was no response,\" Townsville Coroner David Glascow said in his inquest findings. Glascow, however, cited what he said were inconsistencies in Watson's statements to investigators. The coroner said he was \"unable to conclude that Tina's death was an accidental drowning.\"  Watch Tina Watson's family demand justice \u00bb . The couple married just 11 days earlier in Birmingham, Alabama. They left their home in Hoover, Alabama, for their Australian honeymoon two days later, the coroner said. As possible evidence for the husband's motive, Glascow pointed to a statement by the woman's father that Watson asked her to maximize her life insurance and make him the beneficiary shortly before the wedding. The insurance company confirmed that Gabe Watson inquired about her life insurance policy after her death, the coroner said. The coroner noted that Watson, through his lawyers, contended that police had made a judgment that he killed his wife before they began their investigation and that they tailored their investigation to fit their theory. Glascow said he saw no evidence of police rushing to judgment. \"It appears certain that at some point in time, investigators considered some of Gabe's explanations lacked credibility, and it further appears to me that investigators gave Gabe the opportunity to clarify matters which may have caused concern,\" the coroner said.

A protester is grabbed by Nepalese police during a demonstration in Kathmandu. Police also arrested and charged three local Tibetan community leaders with organizing the protest, after seizing them from their homes Thursday morning. It is the largest single-day round-up of Tibetan protesters in Nepal since the demonstrations broke out in March following China's bloody crackdown on protesters in Tibet. It is also the first time that Nepalese authorities have charged any Tibetan exiles in connection with the protests. Nepalese police forcefully dragged some of the protesters to awaiting vans and drove them to police stations across the capital. Tibetan exile groups said 900 protesters were detained Thursday. Authorities said the three arrested leaders -- two women and a man -- were responsible for the near-daily protests since March and will be held for 90 days under Nepal's public security act. \"They have been arrested for damaging the diplomatic relations between Nepal and China,\" said civilian security officer Jaya Mukunda Khanal. The two women arrested and charged for organizing the protests were Ngwang Sangmo, president of Tibetan Women's Association, and Tashi Dolma, vice president of the association. Also charged was Kelsang Chung, director of the Tibetan Reception Center, which helps Tibetan refugees in Nepal emigrate to India, where the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, lives in exile.

Betty Johnson Neumar is shown at her booking. She is charged with hiring a hit man to kill her husband. Betty Neumar, 76, was charged by North Carolina authorities last month with one count of solicitation of murder in the July 1986 death of Harold Gentry, one of her five dead spouses since the 1950s. Since the arrest, authorities have launched an investigation into the deaths of her previous husbands, including John Neumar Sr., her fifth husband. Neumar's son appeared on \"Nancy Grace\" on Wednesday along with Jay Almond, a news editor with the Stanly News and Press in North Carolina. \"It wasn't long after my father married her that he started being sick,\" Neumar said. He said he learned of his father's death when he read it in a local newspaper. Betty Neumar has not been charged in connection with that death or her other three husbands. \"She has only been charged in one state,\" her attorney Charles Parnell said. \"I want to remind everybody she has only been charged in North Carolina, and obviously, she is presumed to be innocent. There is nothing with the other states because there are no charges at this particular time.\" Here is an edited transcript of the show: . Neumar: You know, actually, murder almost never crossed my mind until the Gentry case came up. In fact, we did not know she was married all this time. We just thought that she was married one time and she was a widow lady who married my father. Well, it wasn't long after my father married her that he started being sick and everything. And he was never sick a day in his life [before then]. And I figured something was wrong because he put -- such a wedge became between our families that shouldn't have existed. We were so close. And the longer she was married to him, the less we had to do with him and the more time it seemed like he was sick but she wouldn't let us know about it. In fact, when he did die, I read about it in the newspaper and didn't even know he was dead. And when I went to the funeral home, she already had him cremated. Grace: Had him cremated? Neumar: Correct. Grace: Mr. Neumar, what was the cause of death of your father? Neumar: Well, it's a complicated thing, and I'm not very good with these technical terms and all. But from what the doctors say, it was some type of stomach and bowel and, you know, intestine problem and everything, which I've been told later by some people that the symptoms that he had could be caused by arsenic poisoning. Grace: John, when you first met her, didn't you tell me you believed at that time she was a widow, a one-time widow that married your father? Neumar: Right. That was correct. We were told that her husband just passed away, and my mother had passed away a couple years before that. And we -- you know, we just figured it was a widow and a widower getting married. Grace: How did she meet your father? Neumar: A friend of his went up there to where she had a salon to get haircutting. My father, he went to go up there and get his haircut because I think his barber had retired. So he went up there to get his haircut, and that's where he met her. Grace: And how long after they met did they marry? Neumar: You know, I'm bad with time frame, but I'd say, I think within a year or something like that [1989]. Grace: Quick courtship. Neumar: Right. ... Jay Almond, news editor: The information I have is based on an investigation that the Stanly County Sheriff's Office is running, and information there is that the D.A.'s office and the Stanly County sheriff have gathered evidence from witnesses saying that Betty Neumar solicited to commit murder to her husband, Harold. Thomas Harold Gentry was shot to death in Norwood home near the back door inside the home. He was found by friends or family members -- I believe friendly members sent there by his employers. He didn't report to work. ... And [they] discover him there dead, and then the investigation there ensues but did not lead to anything enough to press charges against anyone. Grace: .. Jay, what can you tell me about this woman? What is her background? Almond: She's a 76-year-old widow ... and she's been married four other times. She initially was inviting to family members, but then sort of became more of a wedge in the family and has gone from there, got colder and -- with previous family members.", "5932d9c8f1da55bad396197ebae0853c515180a5": "(CNN) -- The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday morning that child rapists cannot be given the death penalty, effectively reserving the punishment only for murderers. CNN's Jeffrey Toobin said the court's ruling falls in line with other decisions on the death penalty. The 5-4 decision stems from a Louisiana case in which Patrick Kennedy, 43, was sentenced to die in 2003 for the sexual assault of his 8-year-old stepdaughter. Proponents of Louisiana's law, which allowed child rapists to be eligible for the death penalty, say that besides murder, no crime is more deserving of the death penalty than child rape. Kennedy would have been the first rapist in 44 years to be executed for a crime in which the victim was not killed. In the majority opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy said \"evolving standards of decency\" forbid capital punishment for any crime other than murder. CNN's senior legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin, spoke with CNN's Heidi Collins outside the Supreme Court about the impact of the ruling. Collins: This is a huge decision here. What do you make of it? Toobin: It was just high drama in the court today. It's always dramatic at the end of the Supreme Court term. Here it was literally life and death, one of the big open questions in constitutional law about the death penalty: Can you execute someone for a crime other than murder? Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote on so many cases, decided this case, it was 5-4. ... He didn't diminish the seriousness of the crime, but he said the risks of expanding the death penalty are simply too great. He pointed out that there are more than 5,000 child rapes every year in the United States. All of them would raise the possibility of the death penalty. There are only a handful of states -- I think it was six -- that allow the death penalty for child rape. Forty-four states and the federal government say no. He said there is a national consensus that this is not an appropriate punishment. So, this really rules out not just the death penalty for child rape, but any crime other than murder. So it's a major, major decision.  See more about the reach of the decision \u00bb . Collins: A national consensus except those six states. It's interesting when you look at the court of public opinion. How do you think this decision is going to go down in public? Toobin: Well, I think it's a tough call because support for the death penalty nationwide in the past 10 years has actually been going down. But child rape is such a horrendous crime and all of us have such a natural revulsion towards it that you're never going to get a lot of support for any sort of reduction in sentence. But I think, given the fact that this is a Supreme Court that said no death penalty for murderers under 18, no death penalty for the mentally retarded, this decision is consistent with a certain restriction on the death penalty, which is reflected in the court but also in a kind of national change that's going on. Collins: And in Sean Callebs' piece that we had, I don't know if you heard it. Toobin: I saw it, yeah. Collins: One woman, who actually brought up a very interesting point, when you think about all of this and when you think about the child, the victim, she said, you know, if they know they're going to die for this crime, why would they leave a living witness? Toobin: Justice Kennedy made precisely that point in the opinion. He said, allowing the death penalty here would create a perverse incentive for child rapists to murder their victims. He also pointed out what a difficult moral choice it would put child victims in testifying, giving children literally the power of life and death in their testimony over their attackers. That is something that he wanted to relieve children of -- that burden. Collins: Will they always have to testify? Toobin: Yeah, pretty much. There have been rare examples ... if a child, for example, is simply too young to testify. There are horrible cases of rapes of babies and things like that. But by and large there has to be some sort of testimony from a child. It can be in a noncourtroom setting. It can be sort of in a deposition, not in front of the jury. But you do have to have the child testify. Collins: It's just such a tough decision all around. 5-4 on that one, very interesting.", "daacc676fc659bfd147d11b1409ab42615a2f169": "YUSUFIYA, Iraq (CNN) -- Female suicide bombers, who often slip through security checkpoints untouched because of cultural norms, are taking a more deadly toll than ever across Iraq. A female suicide bomber struck northeast of Baghdad on Sunday, killing 16. But the U.S. Army has created a solution with \"Daughters of Iraq,\" a program that trains Iraqi women to find female suicide bombers. Women carried out eight bombings in all of 2007, according to the U.S. military. Halfway through 2008, the number of female suicide bombers is 20. A suicide attack carried out by a woman on Sunday in Baquba killed at least 16 people and wounded another 40. \"Daughters of Iraq\" is a spinoff of \"Sons of Iraq,\" which employs Iraqi men to run checkpoints and is credited with taking much of the steam out of the insurgency. The goal of the women's program is twofold: to protect against female suicide bombers, and to provide much-needed income to Iraqi women with few chances for employment. In the town of Yusufiya, southwest of Baghdad, some 30 women are being trained to search other females at security checkpoints -- something men are forbidden to do under Iraqi cultural norms. In mid-May, a female suicide bomber killed an Iraqi army officer in this town. \"When he came out to meet her to help her with a problem she was having, she detonated the vest and killed him and injured some of his soldiers,\" said Michael Starz, a U.S. Army captain. The women will work two or three days a month, making up to $300, an Iraqi military officer explained to applicants. In a community, where families struggle to survive, that's good money.  Watch how \"Daughters of Iraq\" works \u00bb . The women come from small farming communities. Many of them are widows with numerous children and almost no income. Such is the story of Fawzia, who has six children to support. Her husband was shot to death when his car broke down. \"I am ready (to work) as long as it helps me financially,\" she said. \"I have five children in school.\" Having women work in this tradition-bound society is a social revolution, according to Fatima, a volunteer leader, told CNN's Jill Dougherty. \"Many women would like to do it but their parents would not agree because it's a rural society and it's shameful for girls to go outside the home.\"", "7a02e707b139791920fb13115d6132541fff7d97": "(CNN)  -- Investigators looking for the source of a salmonella outbreak linked to tomatoes will focus on farms in Mexico and Florida, federal health authorities said Friday. Since April, more than 500 people have contracted the same strain of salmonella, linked to raw tomatoes. The tracebacks \"have taken us from point of consumption all the way back to certain farms in Mexico and Florida,\" said Dr. David Acheson, associate commissioner for foods at the Food and Drug Administration. The agency will send teams of investigators to  farms in both locations this weekend as well as to the pathways from those farms in an attempt to determine where the contamination occurred, he said. The tomatoes may not have been contaminated on a farm, he stressed; the contamination could have occurred in a packing shed, warehouse, supplier chain or distribution center. \"We are going to all of those places to see if there are any problems that could indicate how or why these tomatoes got contaminated,\" he said. The reported advance in the investigation came as the toll mounted, with 552 people identified as having contracted the strain of Salmonella Saintpaul since April in 32 states and the District of Columbia. It is one of the biggest outbreaks of tomato-caused illness in history, officials said.  See where the cases have been reported \u00bb . Though the number of reported victims has risen dramatically in recent days, that does not signify a large number of new infections, Acheson said. Instead, he credited improved surveillance and laboratory identification of previously submitted strains for the increased number. The bulk of the new reports were in Texas, which tallied 265 cases, according to Ian Williams, chief of the OutbreakNet Team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At least 53 of the victims, whose ages range from 1 to 88 years, have been hospitalized. The victims are almost evenly split between males and females. Though no deaths have been officially attributed to the outbreak, a man in his 60s in Texas who had cancer also had the infection, which may have contributed to his death, Williams said.

Congress overrode President Bush's second veto of a $300 billion farm bill. The Senate voted 80-14 to approve the measure over Bush's objections, following a 317-109 vote in the House of Representatives. Both votes were well above the two-thirds majority needed to override the veto, which Bush delivered Wednesday morning. Congress overrode an earlier veto of the farm bill last month, even though lawmakers had discovered that 34 pages were missing in the version originally sent to the White House. In spiking the latest version, Bush said he objected to its continued subsidies for the wealthy and its use of budget gimmicks to hide a $20 billion increase in spending. But Sen. Kent Conrad, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said the measure actually saves the government $110 million. \"This bill does not add to the deficit or debt, because this bill is paid for,\" he said. \"That is not my claim. That is the finding of the Congressional Budget Office.\" The discovery of the missing section, Title III, prompted concerns from House Republicans that the override vote was improper. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the sections of the bill that were originally sent to the president had become law after Congress voted to override Bush's first veto. But to put Title III into effect, Congress re-passed the entire legislation, including the missing pages, and resent it to Bush. The House voted 306-110 at the end of May. The Senate voted 77-15 for the bill at the beginning of June. Two-thirds of the $300 billion in spending for the farm bill will go for nutrition programs such as food stamps. Another $40 billion will go toward farm subsidies, and $30 billion is allocated for payments to farms to keep land idle and other environmental programs. After vetoing the latest version of the farm bill, Bush scolded Congress on Wednesday for not \"modifying certain objectionable, onerous and fiscally imprudent provisions. ... I am returning this bill for the same reasons as stated in my veto message.\" When he vetoed the first version of the farm bill, Bush said it \"continues subsidies for the wealthy and increases farm bill spending by more than $20 billion, while using budget gimmicks to hide much of the increase.\" The president said it would hurt efforts to improve American farmers' access to overseas markets. Congress has passed one other bill over Bush's objections: legislation for a $23 billion water project that the president vetoed in 2007.

Besides the youth vote, Russert discussed his father's death, his upbringing and his own future in journalism and political commentary. Tim Russert, 58, was the host of NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and one of America's leading political journalists. He died of a heart attack after collapsing at the network's Washington bureau on June 13. The following is an edited version of the show's transcript.  Watch video of the discussion \u00bb . Larry King: How did you learn of your dad's passing? Luke Russert: I was in Florence, and I was at an Italian sports bar watching the Italy versus Romania game, and I got a call from my dad's secretary that said he had fainted, and could I get in touch with my mother. Luckily, I was right across the street from the hotel where my mom was. I ran up to her room and said, \"Dad has fainted.\" And we kind of learned in increments of what exactly happened. So it was basically about a half-hour after first hearing that he fainted that we actually knew he collapsed and had a heart attack. And at first, I was upset that I was so far away and removed. And I really wanted to be there. But in reality, it was really a blessing to be an ocean away, because it allowed my mother and me to have some real private time to collect our thoughts, to grieve in private, and not be inundated with all the media coverage and all the phone calls. So, you know, it was something that -- it was difficult, but to have that little cocoon, I think my mother and I really used it to our benefit. King: Must have been a long flight back. Russert: It was. It was a long nine-hour flight. But my mother has been so strong through this. And my family has been there for me every step of the way. My girlfriend has been wonderful. So I can't thank everybody enough. And obviously this happened, but it has made it a lot easier to have such good friends at NBC and all through Washington and my family personally. King: Were you brought up talking politics? Russert: I was. It was always something that was always talked around the dinner table with my father and my mother from a very young age. One of my earliest memories is being a young toddler and remembering Ronald Reagan's face on television. My dad was watching a press conference, most likely at that time on CNN. And it was just something that I always grew up around. And we also talked a lot of sports. We talked a lot of culture. But politics was something that I guess has been engrained in me at a very, very young age. King: Did he pick the brains of you and your friends? Russert: He did. We would actually have some fun discussions where I would assume the role of who his guest would be on Sunday and try to answer the questions that he threw at me. And sometimes, if I could answer a question pretty well, he'd say, \"That question's too easy, I've got to get rid of it.\" So sometimes, I was a guinea pig for politicians. But it was a lot of fun. I enjoyed doing it. And he would also pick the brains of some of my friends. Some did pretty well, and some didn't. But he was always kind to all of us. King: When did you first vote? Russert: I first voted when I was 18, which would have been 2004. And I registered at the same time I registered for the Selective Service, which I think they do here in the District of Columbia. So I've been a registered voter since 2004, and that's the first time I cast an official ballot. King: How did it feel to vote? Russert: It felt great. It kind of felt like you became a man or at least an adult in some capacity. That your decision -- your decision -- became part of the country and its leadership. And I'll never forget the way I voted was I was in college my freshman year, 2004, so I had to go by absentee ballot. And I was going to meet my father in South Bend, Indiana, for the Notre Dame/Boston College game. And I said, \"Dad, I'd rather you bring the ballot personally so it doesn't have to go through the mail, send it up to me in Boston.\" So he brought the ballot, and I filled out my absentee ballot in a South Bend, Indiana, hotel room, and he brought it back and put it right in the FedEx for me. King: We have an e-mail question for you from David in Cary, North Carolina. \"Luke, my condolences,\" it said. \"You've shown great strength and character in recent days. Any chance we'll see you reporting or doing commentary about the 2008 election?\" Russert: Oh yes, you just might. It's something that I'm definitely interested in. I think that I will probably be part of the peacock network. But you never know. I still have the sports show on XM Radio and Carville, and I kind of go into politics. But I wouldn't mind. King: What if CNN made a bid for you? Russert: I'd be your assistant, Larry? King: You got it. You could come to work for us. I think I can speak for management. In fact, they'll probably talk to you tomorrow based on just how well you're handling yourself tonight. Russert: Well, I appreciate it. Everyone has been so kind. I'd love to have the opportunity to come out here and talk about something that is important to me. And it was important to my father, which was young people getting involved.

The Mars Phoenix Lander took this image of the planet's surface at its landing site Sunday. \"It's surprisingly close to what we expected and that's what surprises me most,\" said Peter Smith, the mission's principal investigator. \"I expected a bigger surprise.\" The landing on the Red Planet's arctic plains -- which ended a 296-day journey -- was right on target, a feat NASA's Ed Weiler compared to landing a hole-in-one with a golf ball from 10,000 miles. The landing -- dubbed the \"seven minutes of terror\" -- was a nerve-wracking experience for mission managers, who have witnessed the failure of similar missions. In mission control at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, they celebrated the lander's much-anticipated entry. \"It was better than we could have imagined,\" Barry Goldstein, project manager for the Phoenix mission, told CNN.  Watch the celebration at mission control \u00bb . The Phoenix's 90-day mission is to analyze the soils and permafrost of Mars' arctic tundra for signs of past or present life. The lander is equipped with a robotic arm capable of scooping up ice and dirt to look for organic evidence that life once existed there, or even exists now. \"We are not going to be able to answer the final question of is there life on Mars,\" said principal investigator Peter Smith, an optical scientist with the University of Arizona. \"We will take the next important step. We'll find out if there's organic material associated with this ice in the polar regions. Ice is a preserver, and if there ever were organics on Mars and they got into that ice, they will still be there today.\" The twin to the Mars Polar Lander spacecraft, Phoenix was supposed to travel to Mars in 2001 as the Mars Surveyor spacecraft. They were originally part of the \"better, faster, cheaper\" program, formulated by then-NASA Administrator Dan Goldin to beef up planetary exploration on a lean budget. But Polar malfunctioned during its descent into Mars' atmosphere in 1999 and crashed. An investigation concluded that as many as a dozen design flaws or malfunctions doomed the spacecraft. The failure of that mission, as well as another spacecraft called the Mars Climate Orbiter the same year, led to NASA to put future missions on hold and rethink the \"better, faster, cheaper\" approach. Mars Surveyor went to the warehouse.  Watch the challenges the mission faced \u00bb . But all was not lost. In 2003, Smith proposed a plan to re-engineer the Mars Surveyor and fly it on a mission to look for signatures of life in the ice and dirt of Mars far North. Mars Phoenix, literally and figuratively, rose from the ashes of Surveyor. Engineers set to work, testing and retesting the onboard system to ferret out and fix all the flaws they could find. iReport.com: Send your photos, video of space . \"We always have to be scared to death,\" Goldstein said. \"The minute we lose fear is the minute that we stop looking for the next problem.\" The team was concerned about the Phoenix landing system. NASA had not successfully landed a probe on Mars using landing legs and stabilizing thrusters since the Viking missions in the late 1970s. The other three successful Mars landings -- Pathfinder in 1997 and the Spirit and Opportunity rovers in 2004 -- used massive airbags that inflated around the landing craft just before landing to cushion the impact.  Learn about NASA's past missions to Mars \u00bb . The Phoenix doesn't have airbags because the lander is too big and heavy for them to work properly. Its landing site was targeted for the far northern plains of Mars, near the northern polar ice cap. Data from the Mars Odyssey spacecraft indicate large quantities of ice there, likely in the form of permafrost, either on the surface or just barely underground. \"Follow the water\" has become the unifying theme of NASA's Mars exploration strategy. In 2004, the rover Opportunity found evidence that a salty sea once lapped the shores of an area near Mars' equator called Meridiani Planum. Astrobiologists generally agree that it's best to look for life in wet places.

Spc. Megan Lynn Touma, 23, was a dental specialist from Cold Springs, Kentucky, according to a statement from Fort Bragg, where Touma was assigned to the 19th Replacement Company. Fayetteville police found her body late Saturday morning when they responded to a call about a strong odor coming from one of the rooms. The body was sent to the state Medical Examiner's office in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to determine the cause of death. Touma, who was seven months pregnant, arrived at Fort Bragg on June 12.

CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman has been covering the region for over 15 years. He reports from Gaza on daily life and reality over the past year in this fractious land. CNN's Ben Wedeman reports on the past year in Gaza, where people are safer but out of food, gas, and patience. GAZA CITY, Gaza (CNN)  -- \"If you take pictures, I'll kill you! I'll kill you!\" screamed a masked Fatah gunman, pointing his AK-47 assault rifle at my cameraman, Joe Duran. \"Calm down! Calm down!\" I shouted back at him, turning to Joe to tell him to put the camera down. Joe and I had ducked into a fruit and vegetable shop in Gaza City. We had been covering the funeral of a Fatah gunman killed in a clash with Hamas rivals when our third gunbattle of the day had broken out. The gunman left, much to everyone's relief, and I put my small video camera on the floor and pressed the button to record the constant roar of machine gun fire, which went on for more than half an hour. Earlier in the day, Joe and I were on a street corner videotaping Hamas militiamen when a jeep full of Fatah irregulars opened fire, just down the street from an elementary school. As guns blazed, schoolchildren ran for cover. I watched as shopkeeper Khadar Aliyan slammed shut the doors of his grocery store, the expression on his face one of fear and utter exasperation. \"I'm going home,\" he told me. \"I'm afraid. We're done for. It's never been this bad.\" It was violence like this, which we witnessed on December 2006, that reached a climax in the second week of June 2007. When it ended on June 14, 2007, with Hamas roundly defeating Fatah, Gaza went quiet. And quiet -- relative quiet, that is -- has been Hamas' biggest accomplishment since. No longer do you worry about being kidnapped. Gunbattles, though they can happen, are much less common. After last June's takeover (or coup d'etat, as Fatah supporters call it), Hamas quickly imposed law and order, tried to reacquaint Gaza's drivers with long-forgotten traffic regulations, launched a municipal cleanup campaign, and forced the release of kidnapped BBC journalist Alan Johnston, who had been held in captivity for almost six months. Chaos-weary Gazans applauded all of these initiatives. But the honeymoon ended quickly as reality sank in. Since Hamas won parliamentary elections in January 2006, and even more so since last year's takeover, Israel has tightened its siege of Gaza. Israel has restricted supplies of gasoline, diesel and electricity to Gaza, limited the amount of food and other goods entering the strip, and made it virtually impossible for manufacturers and farmers in Gaza to export anything to the outside world. Israeli officials say these measures are intended to pressure Hamas, which is on the U.S. government list of terrorist groups, to stop its members and other factions from firing mortars and rockets into Israel. Israel Defense Forces reports that 1,500 Qassam rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza in 2007, and 2,383 in the past six years. As a result, almost all of Gaza's factories have shut down and thousands of workers have lost their jobs. Between 70 and 80 percent of the population is dependent on food supplied by the United Nations Refugee Works Agency, set up after more than 700,000 Palestinians became refugees after the war that resulted in Israel's creation in 1948. Life in Gaza, never easy, in the last year has become a grinding daily struggle to make ends meet. For the vast majority of Gazans, it means they must spend much of their time trying to secure basic commodities. Such as cooking gas, which comes from Israel. In the past, when supplies were plentiful, it was sold from the back of trucks and donkey carts. Not anymore. When there are supplies, people flock to a few distribution centers. One is a hot, crowded compound north of Gaza City, where the stench of gas is so strong you shudder with fear that someone will light a cigarette and the whole place will go up in flames. People have to wait for their cooking gas for hours some claim days, in the hot sun. There I met a woman who identified herself as Um Wadi'a (the mother of Wadi'a), who at 2 p.m. told me she had been waiting since 5 a.m. She said she had run out of cooking gas three days before. Typical of so many people here, she blamed both main Palestinian factions for her woes. \"Hamas hasn't done anything for us, nor has Fatah,\" she said. \"All those people want is to sit comfortably on their thrones.\" In Gaza City, long lines of immobile cars and trucks wind around the block from gas stations, their owners waiting, surprisingly patiently, for supplies to arrive. The only other option is to go in search of black market gasoline, much of it smuggled through tunnels from Egypt. It goes for more than $10 a liter, which comes close to almost $50 a gallon. It is now common for families to divide up responsibilities for the day. One family member will go in search of cooking gas, another will join the line for gasoline or diesel, another for whatever else is in short supply. To get around the shortages, some motorists mix their fuel with cooking oil, a practice that isn't particularly good for the motor. Many people complain that it's unhealthy -- but it works. Others, like electrical engineer Wasim Khazandar, are thinking completely outside the box. Wasim has invented an electric car, which he is more than happy to show off. He's already received dozens of orders from motorists weary of the search for fuel. Beyond material concerns, there are worries here that Hamas has a barely concealed hardline Islamist agenda, and one often hears complaints that the group is intolerant of any form of dissent or criticism. One man who can testify to that is Ibrahim Abu Al-Naja, the most senior Fatah leader to remain in Gaza after most fled to safety in Ramallah. Abu Al-Naja is from the Fatah old school, a grizzled veteran of the group's wars in Lebanon. He told me earlier this year Hamas security officials showed up at his home late at night, bound his hands, put a blindfold on him and dragged him to their headquarters, where they shaved his head and cut off his moustache, then released him without apology or explanation. He makes no excuses for Fatah's dismal track record of corruption and mismanagement when it ran Gaza, but says the crisis that began with Hamas' rise to power is nothing short of a catastrophe. \"Our people has been transformed,\" he said, \"into a desperate people, who must search for food, for the minimum of survival. It's as if we returned to 1948, dependent on gifts and assistance and relief.\" Despite all the difficulties of life under Hamas, despite all the grumbling, the men who run Gaza are as confident today as they were a year ago that they will weather the crisis and emerge stronger. Last Wednesday I went to see Ahmed Yusif, a senior adviser to Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya. \"Whatever the Israelis think,\" said the U.S.-educated Yusif, \"whatever pressure they put on us, it's not going to make us buckle or give concessions. \"This is part of the Palestinian struggle for more than 60 years living in the refugee camps,\" he said. \"We don't always enjoy a good life. It's the toughness and the suffering [that] are part of the struggle.\" Others here don't quite see it that way, like a man I met in Gaza's old market who would only identify himself as Abu Khalid. I asked him if he was better off today than a year ago. He laughed, cursed Israel, Hamas, Fatah, the United States, the European Union and the rest of the world, then made the following suggestion: \"Let them open a market in Gaza so we can sell some of our children [in order to] feed the rest.\"", "0590a8c653b7d332d9df195dcf3ce014abb4eff7": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- With polls closed for a Zimbabwe runoff that opposition politicians and international observers call a sham, alleged torture victims who support former candidate Morgan Tsvangirai said Friday that they back his decision to pull out of the race. Many of the injured being treated at a private hospital in Harare, Zimbabwe, asked not to be identified. \"It's a good move by my president, Morgan Tsvangirai,\" said a 26-year-old Movement for Democratic Change activist who said he was forced to stand on hot coals and had boiling water poured on him about a week ago. \"There's no use going for an election.\" The man, who displayed a large, pale, blistered patch on his back, asked not to be identified -- as did others being treated at a private hospital in Harare -- for fear of further attacks by gangs supportive of President Robert Mugabe. All of the victims said they were taken to \"torture bases\" by the gangs, made up of young men and soldiers. In the March 29 election, MDC officials said their polling showed Tsvangirai clearly defeating Mugabe, who at 84 is the only president Zimbabwe has had since it gained independence from Britain in 1980. But after delaying the release of results for more than a week, the country's electoral commission -- which is made up of Mugabe appointees -- said that although Tsvangirai got more votes, he didn't top the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff. MDC supporters had already reported violence against them by police, military members and other supporters of Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. But in the weeks leading up to the runoff, the reports increased in frequency and intensity. More than 70 people were killed in attacks since the election, according to the MDC. Mugabe's supporters have claimed that those attacks were against his party members, a claim international observers, including the United Nations, have disputed.  Watch victims say they were taken to torture camps \u00bb . Tsvangirai and other party leaders were repeatedly arrested by police or detained on their way to political rallies. And reports of beatings and other intimidation tactics were common in areas where the MDC had made strong showings in the election. \"Mostly for the rural people -- the police would come in for the Zanu-PF, so the area was very tense,\" said a municipal worker at the hospital, who said he was kicked and had burning plastic poured on his skin about three or four days ago. \"Everyone was beaten. Whether Zanu-PF or MDC. There was chaos in the country.\" George Charamba, a spokesman for Mugabe, insisted that the vote was \"free and fair.\" Charamba denied that any pressure was being used. Asked about images from Zimbabwe showing what is reported to be violence against members of the opposition, he responded, \"I thought we are long past the age where we could consider pictures as not lying. It's very, very easy for anyone to stage-manage a demonstration, and a violent one at that.\" Last weekend, Tsvangirai withdrew from the runoff, saying there was no way the result would be legitimate. He has spent much of the time since living in the Dutch Embassy in Harare in fear for his safety. Early Friday, the municipal worker said he was considering whether to heed Tsvangirai's call for his supporters to not vote in the election, but the question may be moot. The gangs took his identification card and threw it into a fire, he said. Another man and a woman treated for broken hands at the hospital said they were tortured and had boiling water poured on their genitals for being MDC supporters. The man said he was forced to drink sewage. Meanwhile, Mugabe laughed and mugged for reporters from Zimbabwe's state-run media as he cast his ballot at a high school. \"Very optimistic, upbeat ... and hungry,\" he said when asked how he was feeling.", "f79341438eed40986c3219b67a3b5d87eb6c018a": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's opposition party said four of its activists and the wife of Harare's mayor -- an opposition member -- have been killed by supporters of President Robert Mugabe, just days ahead of next week's presidential runoff. President Robert Mugabe says war veterans will take up arms again if Tsvangirai wins. Thursday's report came as U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice accused Mugabe of sponsoring efforts to starve, beat and kill supporters of his opponent Morgan Tzvangirai so he can win the election. Rice was speaking on the same day that Tendai Biti, the opposition Movement for Democratic Change's secretary-general, was charged with treason after being held in jail without charges for a week. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. His arrest and treason charges have been criticized by African and international leaders who characterize it as a ploy by Mugabe supporters to intimidate the opposition party before his June 27 runoff against Tsvangirai. A spokesman for the MDC blamed Mugabe's Zanu-PF party for the five most recent deaths, saying they brought to 70 the number of MDC party members killed since a bitterly contested election three months ago. The body of the mayor's wife, 27-year-old Abigail Chiroto, was found in a mortuary close to the couple's house north of Harare. She had been beaten so severely with rocks and iron bars that her face was almost unrecognizable, MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said.  Watch CNN's Nkepile Mabuse report on the violience \u00bb . Chiroto was kidnapped, along with her 4-year-old son, on Tuesday. Some of her kidnappers wore military uniforms, Chamisa said. Chiroto's son was released unharmed. Her husband, Emmanuel Chiroto, is an MDC member who was recently elected mayor of Harare. He was not home at the time of the kidnapping. Also Thursday, the MDC said that four other activists were found dead in Chitungwiza. The victims' bodies showed evidence that \"they were heavily tortured until they died,\" an MDC statement said. \"It's unbelievable the way people are being killed or murdered,\" Chiroto said. \"It's almost mass butchering.\" Police confirmed the deaths of the activists but did not link the victims to any political party. Mugabe's party denied any part in the deaths, saying MDC officials made such accusations frequently. \"They are claiming anyone who dies. They phone CNN,\" said Bright Matonga, a Zanu-PF spokesman. \"Whenever someone dies in the hospital, they rush to claim them.\" Matonga said Harare was run by a commission. \"There is no MDC mayor in Zimbabwe,\" he said. \"There is no newly elected mayor in Harare.\"  Learn more about Zimbabwe \u00bb . In New York, Rice convened a meeting about the situation in Zimbabwe at the United Nations on Thursday. \"Mugabe is increasing violence against [the] opposition. ... President Mugabe has squandered the promise of the very nation that was hailed as the jewel of Africa,\" Rice said at a roundtable discussion attended by representatives from many international governments. \"Clearly we have reached a point where broader, stronger, international effort is needed,\" she added. On Friday, a magistrate judge will determine whether prosecutors have enough evidence to proceed with a trial against Biti. The judge also will determine whether Biti will be granted bail or will continue to be jailed until the trial. Biti was charged Thursday with treason, communicating false information prejudicial to the state, bringing the office of the president into disrepute and causing disaffection among armed forces, according to a journalist who was in the Harare courtroom. He denies all the charges.  Watch Biti arrive for his court hearing \u00bb . Biti, wearing a red jacket and looking exhausted, held his head in his hands as the proceedings took place in the packed courtroom. \"I think that one must express very serious objection to the manner in which this whole case is being handled,\" said Tsvangirai, who was in court. \"The accusations are frivolous.\" Three of the charges stem from a document titled \"The Transitional Strategy,\" which Biti is said to have written ahead of the March 29 election. Biti is denying that he wrote the document, and his lawyers described it as \"doctored.\" The fourth charge of communicating falsehoods alleges that Biti announced that Tsvangirai had won the March presidential election by an outright majority, meaning no runoff vote would be needed. In recent weeks, opposition groups and churches have reported numerous cases of kidnappings, torture and other violence in the country targeting opponents of Mugabe. Zanu-PF members have been suspected of being behind the acts. Zanu-PF claims that the MDC is behind the violence. It said MDC members attacked the mayor of Kadoma, a city 140 km (87 miles) southwest of Harare. It also accused MDC activists of causing millions of dollars damage to private business. Last week, Mugabe warned that veterans he commanded in his country's liberation war nearly three decades ago would take up arms again if Tsvangirai won.  Watch an ad vilifying Tsvangirai \u00bb . The MDC is using word of mouth and file-sharing sites such as YouTube to disseminate its campaign advertisements, claiming that they are banned by state media. The group sent advertisements to supporters via e-mail, asking them to forward them to their friends and relatives. \"Since the regime has denied the MDC access to state media, please send the adverts to as many people as you can,\" the e-mail says. \"A new Zimbabwe is near. The dictator is finished. Let's finish it!\" Mugabe has been Zimbabwe's only leader since the war ended in 1980 but is blamed for the economic collapse of a country once considered a regional breadbasket. Zimbabweans increasingly are unable to afford food and other essentials, with agriculture paralyzed by land reform and the world's highest rate of inflation. Police have arrested Tsvangirai several times in the weeks leading up to the runoff, most recently on Saturday, with 11 other officials and supporters from his party. South African President Thabo Mbeki met Mugabe and Tsvangirai on Wednesday in the hope of quelling tensions. Mbeki was visiting in his capacity as mediator with the 14-nation Southern African Development Community, the South African government said Wednesday. He is under domestic and international pressure for his perceived conciliatory stance toward Mugabe, but the South African leader recently said he would continue his quiet diplomacy despite recent events.

Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, greet supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina. As polls closed in Indiana, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Obama, but by the end of the evening, Clinton's lead had shrunk, dragging the race out until early Wednesday. A clear winner did not emerge until 1:15 a.m. Wednesday -- seven hours after the polls closed -- because results were slow to come in from Lake County, a Chicago suburb in northwestern Indiana with several precincts that went strongly for Obama. By Wednesday morning, all absentee ballots had been counted in Lake County and the final results showed Obama had taken the county by 12 percentage points. There were 115 delegates at stake in North Carolina and 72 in Indiana. Because Democratic delegates are awarded proportionally, Obama added four delegates to his lead, according to CNN estimates. Obama earlier claimed a decisive victory in North Carolina. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Obama held a 14-point lead over Clinton.

Clinton told her supporters in Indianapolis, \"it's full-speed on to the White House.\"  Watch Clinton greet her supporters \u00bb . Clinton made a strong pitch to blue-collar workers in Indiana. She pulled a majority of the votes in rural and suburban Indiana during Tuesday's primary. In CNN exit polling, Clinton took 53 percent of the vote in suburban areas, compared with 47 percent for Obama of Illinois. She took 68 percent of the rural vote compared with Obama's 32 percent. In all, 1,738 voters were polled. Clinton had pitched herself as the candidate best-suited to turn around a flailing economy and consciously courted working-class voters in the state -- even driving a pickup truck up to a gas pump once to help promote her proposed temporary rollback of federal tax on gasoline. \"I believe that Americans need a champion in their corners,\" she said at a rally in Indianapolis. \"For too long we've had a president who has stood up and spoken out for the wealthy and the well-connected, but I don't think that's what Americans need. \"Standing up for working people is about the American dream and about the Democratic Party; standing up for the middle class is who we are and what we can be if we stick together.\" Eighty-nine percent of Indiana voters said they have been affected by what they called a recession. Clinton had a slight edge when voters were asked who is most likely to improve the economy -- taking 49 percent to Obama's 47 percent. The candidates now turn their attention to the upcoming contests in West Virginia, Kentucky and Oregon. According to early exit polls, half of Clinton's supporters in Indiana would not vote for Obama in a general election matchup with Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.  Watch what the exit polls show \u00bb . A third of Clinton voters said they would pick McCain over Obama, while 17 percent said they would not vote at all. Forty-eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would back Obama in November. Obama got even less support from Clinton backers in North Carolina, where 45 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for him over McCain. Thirty-eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for McCain while 12 percent said they would not vote. Obama voters appear to be more willing to support Clinton in November. In Indiana, 59 percent of Obama backers said they'd vote for Clinton, and 70 percent of Obama backers in North Carolina said vote for her against McCain. Obama on Tuesday said he didn't agree with those who said his party would not be able to unite. \"Tonight, many of the pundits have suggested that this party is inalterably divided -- that Sen. Clinton's supporters will not support me, and that my supporters will not support her,\" he said. \"I'm here tonight to tell you that I don't believe it. Yes, there have been bruised feelings on both sides. Yes, each side desperately wants their candidate to win. But ultimately, this race is not about Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or John McCain. \"This election is about you -- the American people -- and whether we will have a president and a party that can lead us toward a brighter future.\" Obama currently leads in pledged delegates and in states won, and he is ahead in the popular vote, if Florida and Michigan are not factored into the equation. Those states are being penalized for moving their primaries up in violation of party rules. With neither candidate expected to win the 2,025 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination by June 3, the end of the primary season, the final decision will most likely fall to the 796 superdelegates: Democratic governors, members of Congress and party officials.

Workers remove fuel rods on the reactor floor at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear facility this year. In fact, North Korea's confessions of many of its nuclear sins -- and its shutdown of its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon -- are the closest the international community has come to curbing North Korea's nuclear program. As a result of Pyongyang's handover of the 60-page declaration document -- and Friday's expected destruction of the cooling tower at Yongbyon -- President Bush ordered some sanctions against North Korea lifted and instructed the State Department to remove the reclusive communist nation from U.S. lists of enemies and nations that support terrorism. But as important as what the document says is what it doesn't say. There is no mention of how many weapons North Korea has or where they are hidden. Nor did North Korea admit to a suspected uranium enrichment program or what nuclear secrets it may have shared with Syria. Both issues are reduced in the declaration to \"concerns\" Pyongyang promises to address down the road. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have pledged a robust verification process to double-check North Korea's claims. And North Korea has promised to allow U.S. inspectors access to the Yongbyon facility and to interview its nuclear experts. But it is far from clear whether Pyongyang will allow the kind of intrusive inspections of its entire nuclear arsenal that the United States will need to get a complete picture of North Korea's program. Congressional Republicans not so sure about Pyongyang . The stiffest opposition to the deal is coming from conservative Republicans. Once considered President Bush's strongest allies in confronting North Korea's nuclear ambition, they feel that the Bush administration has let North Korea off the hook, especially when it comes to its enriched uranium program and suspected proliferation to Syria. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, expressed \"profound disappointment\" over Bush's announcement that North Korea would be coming off the lists of enemies and state sponsors of terrorism. And Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Michigan, the top Republican on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, accused President Bush of sacrificing its principles for a foreign policy success. \"A decision seemingly has been made that it is more important for the White House to reach a legacy agreement than to get to the bottom of North Korea's nuclear efforts,\" Hoekstra said. \"Lifting sanctions and removing North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism flies in the face of history and rewards its brutal dictator for shallow gestures.\" Rep. Ed Royce, R-California, called North Korea's declaration late and incomplete, alleging that North Korea built a nuclear facility for Syria, considered a terrorist state by the United States, while the nuclear negotiations were ongoing. That, he said, was proof that Pyongyang can't be trusted. \"How do you have a meaningful declaration of your nuclear program without saying how many bombs you have?\" Royce asked. \"This is a signal to other proliferating regimes that nuclear weapons will be rewarded without ever having to give them up.\" Democrats, who once criticized Bush for not talking directly to North Korea about its nuclear program, are cautiously supportive of the deal. Howard Berman, the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called the North's submission of a declaration \"encouraging.\" Even former presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, praised the Bush administration, saying \"engaging our enemies can pay dividends.\" But Kerry added, \"historians will long wonder why this administration did not directly engage North Korea before Pyongyang gathered enough material for several nuclear weapons, tested a nuclear device and the missiles to deliver them.\" Are we headed down the same road with Iran? In his 2002 State of the Union address, Bush termed Iraq, North Korea and Iran the \"axis of evil,\" saying they were \"arming to threaten the peace of the world.\" Fourteen months after delivering that speech -- and after dictator Saddam Hussein released a 12,000-page declaration that it had no weapons of mass destruction -- U.S. forces invaded Iraq. But no such program was found, nor were stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction. More than five years into the war, the United States is still battling al Qaeda and Iraqi insurgents there. Six-party talks with North Korea began in 2003, after North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Progress was limited until 2007, when North Korea agreed to shut down Yongbyon and allow international monitors back into the country for monitoring and verification. Progress has been even more limited for the third member of the \"axis of evil,\" Iran. The Bush administration has joined the other members of the U.N. Security Council -- Britain, France, China and Russia, along with Germany -- in offering Iran a set of political and economic incentives similar to the ones North Korea was given in exchange for suspending its uranium enrichment program. But the United States has refused to sit down with Iran until that suspension takes place. The U.N. Security Council has passed three resolutions imposing sanctions against Iran, and the United States has worked with some success to isolate Iran from the international financial community. But unlike North Korea, which is isolated and desperately in need of international aid, Iran is rich in oil and a powerful force in the Middle East. And it's only getting richer and more immune to sanctions as oil prices skyrocket. And Iran seems to be running out the clock and waiting to try its luck with a new U.S. president. Sen. Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has pledged to engage Iran in direct talks to try to curb its nuclear ambitions. Sen. John McCain, the presumptive GOP nominee, has taken a much tougher line, refusing to rule out military action to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. With the coming change in the U.S. administration, U.S. officials, diplomats and other Iran experts believe that it would be at least eight months to a year before the United States and Iran could seriously think about talking. Meanwhile, by its own admission, Iran continues to perfect its nuclear technology. If the North Korean experience can serve as a lesson for the next U.S. president, that lesson may well be that the longer the United States waits to talk to Iran, the higher the cost will be to get Tehran out of the nuclear business.", "e35669d4530ea55bc8f0e451268cab9e9eaeab92": "(CNN)  -- The last of six Texas A&M University mariners who went missing in the Gulf of Mexico was found dead Sunday afternoon, the Coast Guard said. The other five crewmates were rescued earlier in the day. Members of the Texas A&M Offshore Sailing Team are shown in this photo from the team's Web site. The deceased mariner was identified by the university as Roger Stone, the vessel's second safety officer. The survivors -- four university students and a safety officer -- told the Coast Guard they were forced off their sailboat after it took on water and capsized. \"The flooding was so fast that the thing flipped over,\" Coast Guard Capt. William Diehl told CNN. The sailboat, named Cynthia Woods, was one of about two dozen boats heading from Galveston, Texas, to Veracruz, Mexico, for the annual Veracruz Regatta race, which began on Friday. Diehl said the boat was well-stocked with safety equipment -- including emergency radio beacons, life rafts and ring buoys -- but the crew could only manage to find four life jackets after the boat tipped over. \"The survivors told us that [when] they went into the water, they had four life jackets among the five, and they huddled together and they exchanged the life jackets among them so that they could stay afloat,\" Diehl said. Communication with the boat was lost about midnight Friday, and the boat missed its 8 a.m. radio check the next morning, the Coast Guard reported. A sailboat matching the description of the missing 38-foot boat was found overturned about 5:15 p.m. Saturday, authorities said. The five survivors were found several hours later about 23 miles south of Freeport, Texas, according to the Coast Guard's press release. They were lifted to safety by a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter around 2 a.m. local time and taken to University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston for treatment. The search for the missing crew member involved two Coast Guard helicopters, a Falcon jet, a Marine Corps C-130 -- which has night-vision capabilities -- and the Coast Guard cutter Manowar. All of those on board the capsized sailboat were experienced sailors, Diehl said. \"They were very well trained,\" Diehl said. \"Obviously [they were] the more senior cadets at the university here, and they had very experienced safety people on board.\" When rescuers retrieved the capsized boat's hull, Diehl said the keel was missing. \"That's the part that keeps the sailboat balanced in the water,\" he said. \"And from talking to the survivors this morning, that's where the flooding started for them.\" The 725-mile Veracruz regatta began on Friday and boats are expected to arrive in Veracruz on Wednesday and Thursday.", "d3ca193f45aef9aa766d52fbc58d6b8f1658ee60": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- After wrapping up the longest presidential primary campaign in modern history, Sen. Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that she is ready to turn her attention back to being the junior senator from New York. Sen. Hillary Clinton is greeted with cheers as she returns to the Senate after a two-week vacation. \"I look forward to being back with this great team,\" she said as she returned to the Senate at the end of a two-week vacation, taken after she conceded the 17-month-long primary contest to Sen. Barack Obama. The second-term New York Democrat pledged to \"immerse myself in there,\" pointing to the chamber. She had just emerged from the party's weekly luncheon, which Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called \"one of the most emotional caucuses\" he's ever attended on Capitol Hill. He said the New York senator entered the event to a sea of high fives, cheers and a standing ovation from her Democratic colleagues. Clinton said the opportunity to run for the Oval Office allowed her to \"immerse myself in the extraordinary resilience and resourcefulness that is the American people.\"  Watch Clinton being greeted with cheers \u00bb . \"I come back with an even greater depth of awareness about what we have to do here in Washington,\" she said. \"So many of the concerns that people have expressed to me over the course of this campaign are ones that they can't individually solve. They can't even really take it on just at the state or local level.\" Clinton said that in addition to working \"very hard to elect Sen. Obama our president,\" she plans to campaign on behalf of Democratic Senate candidates. \"We have been unfortunately stymied by the stalling tactics\" of Republicans, she said, noting the need for 60 votes to get any legislation passed in the Senate. \"It's going to be up to the Democratic Party, and particularly the Democratic Senate, to make progress on everything from health care and the economy to ending the war in Iraq,\" she said. \"I look forward to being back with this great team that we have here and doing everything I can to make that happen.\" Clinton said she is not spending time on the possibility that she may be asked to fill the No. 2 spot on Sen. Barack Obama's presidential ticket. \"You know, it is not something that I think about,\" she said. \"This is totally Sen. Obama's decision, and that's the way it should be.\" But she made clear, as she tried to do in her ultimate concession speech June 7, that her supporters should not stray toward John McCain, no matter any hard feelings left over from a bruising primary. \"Anyone who voted for me has very little in common with the Republican Party,\" she said. Thursday night, Obama and Clinton are set to meet with key donors in Washington. The next day, the two will appear jointly in Unity, New Hampshire, a small town on that state's western border where the two candidates tied in the January primary. \"This is going to be a symbolic event that I hope will rally the Democratic Party behind the nominee,\" she said. Obama said he looked forward to working with Clinton and her husband, former President Clinton, on his campaign for the White House. \"Bill Clinton is one of the most intelligent, charismatic political leaders that we have seen in a generation, and he has got a lot of wisdom to impart,\" Obama said Tuesday. \"We are going to be working very closely with him and Sen. Clinton to make sure that we not only win in November, but we actually govern in a way that delivers on the promise of universal health care, good jobs and good wages, clean energy, lower gas prices, the things that are really going to make an impact on people's lives,\" he said.  Watch Obama discuss Clintons' role \u00bb . Obama said the senator's presidential campaign had \"enhanced\" her stature in a way that would bolster her efficacy in the Senate. \"She garnered not just votes but passion and support of so many millions of people,\" Obama said. \"She's going to be a force to be reckoned with not only in the Senate, but hopefully, if I'm successful in the White House, she's going to be one of my key partners in making sure that were moving forward on issues like healthcare that she cares so deeply about.\" At an event in Riverside, California, Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said Clinton is probably returning to the Senate with greater political clout. \"I think, if I had to guess, that the fact that the she ran an honorable and incredibly long and dedicated campaign for the nomination of her party would indicate to me that she would probably return to the United States senate with enhanced prestige and enhanced influence,\" McCain said. He also praised Clinton for her work on military matters since joining the legislative body in 2001. \"I think that Sen. Clinton has already attained a position of leadership in the United States Senate,\" he said. \"She works hard at her job. She is a very important member of the Armed Services Committee, and I have worked together with her on a variety of national security issues.\" McCain is working hard to persuade Clinton supporters to back his campaign.

Prince William has helped bust a speed boat smuggling $80 million worth of cocaine. William, who is serving in the Royal Navy, helped make the bust last weekend when he spotted a speedboat found to be carrying nearly a ton of cocaine in the Atlantic Ocean, Britain's Ministry of Defense said Wednesday. William, 26, was one of the crew members aboard a helicopter attached to the frigate HMS Iron Duke who spotted the ocean-going speedboat hundreds of miles northeast of Barbados, the defense ministry said . The 50-foot-long power boat raised suspicions because it was a small vessel far out to sea and resembled a \"go-fast\" boat commonly used for drug smuggling, the ministry said. The boat's location suggested it was en route to Europe or North Africa, it said. The chopper's crew informed the ship's captain about the boat, and U.S. Coast Guard personnel who were on the frigate then boarded the boat. They found 45 bales of cocaine weighing a total of 900 kilograms (just under a ton), the defense ministry said. The cocaine has a minimum street value of $80 million, the ministry said. The bust went smoothly with no violence, defense officials said. Navy crew detained the five men on the boat, which was in poor condition and later sank. William is in the middle of a two-month attachment with the Royal Navy as part of his continued experience with various branches of the military. The prince, who is called sub lieutenant Wales in the navy, is also expected to spend time aboard a mine hunter and submarine during his attachment, which ends August 1. William's vessel, the Iron Duke, is a patrol boat which supports overseas British territories in the event of a hurricane and carries out counter-narcotic operations. William completed a four-month attachment with the Royal Air Force earlier this year and received his pilot's wings on graduation in April. He learned to fly three different aircraft during the attachment and is known as Flying Officer Wales within the RAF. William is already a second lieutenant in the British Army, where he serves in the Blues and Royals regiment of the Household Cavalry.

The measure failed to achieve the 60 votes required by Senate rules to proceed. The vote was 51-43. Six Republicans, including three seeking re-election in November, broke ranks to support the bill. Two Democrats -- Sen. Mary Landrieu of oil-producing state Louisiana and Majority Leader Harry Reid, who voted no to be able to bring the measure back to the floor under Senate rules -- voted against the measure. Along with placing a special tax of 25 percent on oil companies, the bill would have permitted lawsuits against the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the oil-producing cartel, and suspended deposits into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Profits from renewable energy sources would be excluded from the tax. \"We're not afraid, on this side, to go after Big Oil when they are not doing the right thing,\" said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York. \"And we are not afraid to go after OPEC because they are a cartel that squeezes us. \"We're not afraid to do some strong tough things that will -- some in the short run, some in the longer run -- that will bring down the price, the all too high price, of gasoline.\" Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-North Dakota, said the measure was needed to \"wring out\" speculators he blamed for driving the price of crude oil to more than $130 a barrel in recent weeks . But Senate Republicans insisted the new taxes ultimately would hurt consumers and cut American oil supply, saying Democrats simply were playing election-year politics. The bill is \"pure and simple a pathetic attempt to even call itself an energy plan,\" said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said, \"Hitting the gas companies might make for good campaign literature or evening news clips, but it won't address the problem. This bill isn't a serious response to gas prices. It is just a gimmick.\" The Kentucky Republican added, \"They are hoping the idea of going after energy companies will create the illusion of action after a week in which they themselves fought for a bill that would make the problem worse. What a political charade.\" As the average cost of gas edged above $4 a gallon, high prices are definitely on the minds of voters. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday shows 40 percent of respondents are more concerned about the cost of gasoline than long lines at the pump, which occurred during the energy crisis of the 1970s. But 55 percent of those surveyed are more worried about the long lines and rationing. The poll results reflect telephone interviews with 1,035 adults on Wednesday and Thursday.

Rescued diver Kath Mitchinso embraces fellow diver Ernest Lewandowsky as they arrive on Flores island. The group was found at Mantaolan, on the island of Rinca off the Komodo National Park, after going missing Thursday. The divers -- three Britons, a Frenchman and a Swede -- spent two nights on the deserted island, which is home to the large Komodo dragon, before rangers found them Saturday. Frenchman Laurent Pinel, 31, said the group had to fight off one dragon with rocks and scavenged for shellfish as they waited to be rescued, Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper reported. \"On the beach a Komodo dragon came amongst us [Friday] afternoon,\" Pinel said, describing how the group had to pelt the dangerous reptile with rocks to scare it away. \"We had nothing to eat.

An Iranian flag flies outside the building containing the reactor of Bushehr nuclear power plant, south of Tehran. White House, CIA and State Department officials declined comment on Hersh's report, which appears in this week's issue of The New Yorker. Hersh told CNN's \"Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer\" that Congress has authorized up to $400 million to fund the secret campaign, which involves U.S. special operations troops and Iranian dissidents. President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have rejected findings from U.S. intelligence agencies that Iran has halted a clandestine effort to build a nuclear bomb and \"do not want to leave Iran in place with a nuclear program,\" Hersh said. \"They believe that their mission is to make sure that before they get out of office next year, either Iran is attacked or it stops its weapons program,\" Hersh said. The new article, \"Preparing the Battlefield,\" is the latest in a series of articles accusing the Bush administration of preparing for war with Iran. He based the report on accounts from current and former military, intelligence, and congressional sources.  Watch Hersh discuss what he says are the administration's plans for Iran \u00bb . \"As usual with his quarterly pieces, we'll decline to comment,\" White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe told CNN. \"The CIA, as a rule, does not comment on allegations regarding covert operations,\" CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said.

Hersh said U.S. efforts were staged from Afghanistan, which also shares a border with Iran. He said the program resulted in \"a dramatic increase in kinetic events and chaos\" inside Iran, including attacks by Kurdish separatists in the country's north and a May attack on a mosque in Shiraz that killed 13 people. The United States has said it is trying to isolate Iran diplomatically in order to get it to come clean about its nuclear ambitions. But Bush has said \"all options\" are open in dealing with the issue. Iran insists its nuclear program is aimed at providing civilian electric power, and refuses to comply with U.N. Security Council demands that it halt uranium enrichment work. U.N. nuclear inspectors say Tehran held back critical information that could determine whether it is trying to make nuclear weapons. Israel, which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal, conducted a military exercise in the eastern Mediterranean in early June involving dozens of warplanes and aerial tankers. The distance involved in the exercise was roughly the same as would be involved in a possible strike on the Iranian nuclear fuel plant at Natanz, Iran, a U.S. military official said. In 1981, Israeli warplanes destroyed an Iraqi nuclear reactor. Iran's parliament speaker, Ali Larijani, warned other countries against moves that would \"cost them heavily.\" In comments that appeared in the semi-official Mehr news agency Sunday, an Iranian general said his troops were digging more than 320,000 graves to bury troops from any invading force with \"the respect they deserve.\" \"Under the law of war and armed conflict, necessary preparations must be made for the burial of soldiers of aggressor nations,\" said Maj.

After signing the bill, Bush said the men and woman of the armed services are owed \"our unflinching support, and the best way to demonstrate that support is to give them the resources they need to do their jobs and to prevail.\" Bush also said he appreciated that \"Republicans and Democrats in Congress agreed to provide these vital funds without tying the hands of our commanders and without an artificial timetable of withdrawal from Iraq.\"   Watch as Bush thanks Congress \u00bb . \"This bill shows the American people that even in an election year, Republicans and Democrats can come together to stand behind our troops and their families,\" Bush said.

Today, violence is at the lowest level since March of 2004,\" he said. \"As a result of this progress, some of our troops are coming home, as a result of our policy called 'Return on Success.' We welcome them home.\" White Houses spokeswoman Dana Perino called the bill a victory for the president. \"Because we have seen success in the surge, perhaps Congress decided that it was OK to allow the commander in chief to be able to move forward as he saw fit,\" said Perino, noting the $162 billion was the same amount that the president had requested. The supplemental spending bill also contains a new GI Bill that expands education benefits for veterans who have served since the 9/11 attacks, provides a 13-week extension of unemployment benefits and more than $2 billion in disaster assistance for parts of the Midwest that have been hit by record floods.

Barack Obama's speech on patriotism comes days before the Fourth of July. \"At certain times over the last 16 months, I have found, for the first time, my patriotism challenged -- at times as a result of my own carelessness, more often as a result of the desire by some to score political points and raise fears and doubts about who I am and what I stand for,\" he said in President Harry Truman's hometown, just days before the Fourth of July. Obama vowed to never question the patriotism of others in the campaign, adding \"I will not stand idly by when I hear others question mine.\" Obama has been defending his patriotism ever since the beginning of the primary season, when he was first criticized for not wearing a flag pin -- which he now does much more frequently -- and when false rumors began circulating that he did not say the Pledge of Allegiance.  Watch excerpts of Obama's speech \u00bb .

At his appearance Monday, Barack Obama appealed to unity. \"Given the enormous challenges that lie before us, we can no longer afford these sorts of divisions,\" he said. \"None of us expect that arguments about patriotism will, or should, vanish entirely; after all, when we argue about patriotism, we are arguing about who we are as a country, and more importantly, who we should be. \"But surely, we can agree that no party or political philosophy has a monopoly on patriotism. And surely, we can arrive at a definition of patriotism that, however rough and imperfect, captures the best of America's common spirit.\" Obama said that for him, \"patriotism starts as a gut instinct, a loyalty and love for country that's rooted in some of my earliest memories.\" Obama described how as he grew up, his patriotism matured to something that \"would survive my growing awareness of our nation's imperfections: its ongoing racial strife; the perversion of our political system that were laid bare during the Watergate hearings; the wrenching poverty of the Mississippi Delta and the hills of Appalachia.\" Obama said he learned that \"what makes America great has never been its perfection, but the belief that it can be made better.\" Patriotism, he said, must involve the willingness to sacrifice. He called attention to the service of John McCain, the presumptive Republican candidate. McCain's campaign has been calling on Obama to condemn comments from retired Gen. Wesley Clark, who said this weekend that McCain's service in Vietnam did not necessarily mean that he was qualified to serve as commander-in-chief. Read about what Clark said . Clark is a military adviser for Obama. In his speech Monday, Obama did not directly address Clark's comments, but after calling attention to McCain's service, he said \"no one should ever devalue that service, especially for the sake of a political campaign, and that goes for supporters of both sides.\" \"We must always express our profound gratitude for the service of our men and women in uniform. Period,\" he said. Just as Obama was finishing his speech, his campaign released a statement about Clark's remarks. \"As he's said many times before, Sen. Obama honors and respects Sen. McCain's service, and of course he rejects yesterday's statement by Gen. Clark,\" Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said. Meanwhile, McCain's campaign announced Monday it was launching a new Truth Squad to defend the Arizona senator's military record.

Obama and his surrogates and his supporters want to engage in, I understand that,\" he said. \"But it doesn't reduce the price of a gallon of gas by one penny. It doesn't achieve our energy independence or make it come any closer ... and it certainly doesn't do anything to address the challenges that Americans have in keeping their jobs, their homes and supporting their families.\" Obama was to follow up Monday's speech on patriotism with an address Tuesday about faith and remarks later in the week on service. He will spend his Fourth of July in Butte, Montana, campaigning with his family. McCain on Monday was campaigning in Pennsylvania, a battleground state in the general election.

People arrested by Bangladesh police in their latest round-up arrive at a jail in Dhaka. Human rights groups decry the actions as politically motivated. The round-ups began May 28, days after the two main political parties said they would not cooperate with the military-backed caretaker government on organizing the elections. Police told CNN that by Saturday 16,916 arrests had been made, while local media reported another 1,548 were arrested Sunday. The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said hundreds of their party members had been taken into custody. \"The timing and targets of the arrests are a dead giveaway they are politically motivated,\" Brad Adams of the New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a statement. \"It's obvious that they are paying the price for the political parties' refusal to accept the government's conditions to participate in the elections.\" The government rejects the allegations. The detentions, it said, are part of a planned sweep to rid the country of criminals. \"Our IGP [Inspector General of Police, or chief of police] categorically said this special drive was being conducted to create a congenial atmosphere before the general election,\" said Kamrul Ahsan, a spokesman for Bangladesh Police. \"It is not politically motivated,\" he said. \"The intention is not to harass anybody politically.\" The crackdown began after the Awami League and the BNP said they would not cooperate with the government to develop a roadmap toward democracy unless it first releases the parties' leaders. The two women who head the parties -- Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League and Khaleda Zia of the BNP -- are in police custody on corruption-related charges. Hasina is charged with bribe-taking. Zia is being held on charges of graft for improperly awarding a multi-million dollar government contract. The current political crisis in the Muslim-majority South Asian country of 150 million can be traced, in large part, to the lingering animosity between the two women, political observers say. Their rivalry runs so deep that the women are known in the country as the \"Battling Begums.\" Begum is an honorific given to women of rank in the country. Since the country's independence in 1972, the Awami League or the BNP has ruled Bangladesh for all but eight years. Both women have served as prime minister at one point or another. After its last stint in power ended in 2006, the BNP handed over rule to a caretaker government to conduct elections, as mandated by the country's constitution. But the Awami League refused to recognize the neutrality of the interim government. Hasina accused Zia of stocking it with BNP backers. Supporters and party members took to the streets in months of deadly clashes. To stem the tide of violence, a military-backed government took control in January 2007 and imposed an indefinite state of emergency. It also postponed elections until it said it could clean up the country's graft-ridden politics. The caretaker government adopted the Emergency Powers Rules. The rules allowed authorities to arrest people without a warrant as long as there was reasonable suspicion that he or she was connected to a crime, Human Rights Watch said. A wave of detentions followed. By some estimates more than 90,000 people were detained before some were released and others charged with crimes. Among those arrested were more than 150 top politicians, including Hasina and Zia -- leading to the current political stalemate. The government wants to hold elections in the third week of December, and said the crusade on crime is part of its plan to ensure trouble-free balloting. The political parties allege the arrests are intended to pave the way for the election of pro-government candidates.

They also threatened to organize mass movements to secure their leaders' release. \"It's kind of an impasse,\" said Taleya Rehman, founder and executive director of the Bangladesh-based non-profit Democracy Watch. \"The government is conducting political dialogue with small parties. But they are of no significance. They need the two major parties.\" On Monday, the government announced it was releasing Hasina from custody on medical grounds so she can go abroad for treatment. A similar release for Zia was also expected. Party members say the government's move is a ploy to sideline the pair from the elections by sending them out of the country.

People seeking refuge sit on a curb and sidewalk outside the U.S. Embassy in Harare on Thursday. By evening, embassy officials were moving \"most of the women and children into safe houses,\" and were trying to get water and blankets for the growing crowd, Weinberg said. Some of the refuge-seekers, identifying themselves as supporters of the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change, said militia members supporting President Robert Mugabe's party destroyed their homes or were hunting them because of their affiliation, according to a journalist at the scene. CNN is not identifying the reporter for security reasons. The journalist said the refuge-seekers, some holding their possessions, sat outside the building Thursday afternoon, waiting to be addressed by a U.S. Embassy official. A few of the people had bandaged wounds, according to the reporter. \"The people I can see right now look very miserable, dejected, confused,\" the reporter said.  Watch the refuge-seekers wait outside the embassy \u00bb . The MDC has said its members were targeted by supporters of Mugabe during the weeks surrounding March's presidential election and last week's runoff. MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai withdrew from the June 27 runoff, citing violence, intimidation and allegations of vote-rigging. That left Mugabe as the only runoff candidate, allowing him to claim re-election. Tsvangirai himself fled to South Africa for a short time in March during the campaign season, saying he feared for his safety. He also sought refuge in the Dutch Embassy in Harare on June 22, shortly after announcing he was withdrawing from the runoff. He returned to his Harare home this week, a Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Several Western nations denounced the violence and declared Mugabe's runoff victory illegitimate. Reports of violence have continued after the runoff. On Monday, the MDC claimed that a politician from the party was abducted at gunpoint outside a courthouse in the city of Mutare. The assailants, who the MDC said wore military outfits, took Naison Nemadziva, a lawmaker who recently won a seat in parliament against a member of Mugabe's party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front. The MDC claimed in a press release that the kidnapping was by supporters of ZANU-PF and that police had not been able to find the lawmaker. This week, a resolution from the African Union in Egypt called for negotiations between Tsvangirai and Mugabe, and some European Union officials have called for a coalition government in Zimbabwe with Tsvangirai as its leader. But Tsvangirai this week said the \"conditions prevailing in Zimbabwe ... are not conducive\" to negotiations with Mugabe. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Wednesday said Mugabe \"has blood on his hands\" after the violence leading to the runoff and should step down.

Suspected spree killer Nicholas Troy Sheley, 28, did not enter a plea during his first court appearance. Nicholas T. Sheley, 28, is being held on $1 million bail in one slaying as police and prosecutors prepare additional charges in connection with a week-long killing spree in two states. Sheley, 28,  appeared in an Illinois courtroom on Wednesday via closed-circuit television, but did not enter a plea. He was charged with first-degree murder in the death of Ronald Randall, 65, whose body was found behind a grocery story in Galesburg. Other charges include aggravated battery, vehicle hijacking and vehicle theft.  Watch Sheley's perp walk \u00bb . Sheley, who wore a green-and-white striped jail jumpsuit, said little except to answer \"yes, sir,\" to a series of questions from Judge Edward Ferguson. Authorities say Sheley's alleged burst of violence spanned 300 miles until he gave up without a fight when police confronted him as he smoked outside a bar in Granite City, Illinois, on Tuesday night.  Map: See where the bodies were found \u00bb . Additional charges are being filed in a second Illinois county which encompasses two other towns where police believe Sheley killed five people, authorities said. Authorities also suspect Sheley in connection with the slayings of an Arkansas couple in Festus, Missouri. All eight victims, which include a child, died from blunt-force trauma to the head, officials said. Sheley's capture ended an intensive manhunt, which included a $25,000 reward offer. Sheley had stopped at Bindy's bar, a popular cop bar in a Granite City shopping center. Two patrons who recognized him from news reports called police. Bar owner Bill Watson told CNN Sheley came in, drank a glass of water and went to the restroom. When he returned from the restroom, Sheley  asked for a lighter but was told he had to go outside to smoke. He was outside smoking when authorities arrived and arrested him. As bar patrons celebrated Sheley's arrest, a family member of one of the victims called and thanked them for their assistance, Watson said. \"It really hit home and made us realize really what this guy was all about,\" Watson said. New of Sheley's capture calmed nerves in small towns from the Chicago to St. Louis areas. Police conducting a welfare check Sunday at an apartment in Rock Falls, Illinois, found four people dead, including the child. Sheley was a \"known associate\" to at least one of the Rock Falls victims, state police said. Rock Falls is across the Rock River from Sterling; both are in Whiteside County. The following day, Monday, authorities found Randall's  body in Galesburg, about 80 miles south of Rock Falls, and obtained an arrest warrant naming Sheley. The couple found dead in Festus, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb, was in town for a graduation, authorities said, and were last seen at a Comfort Inn there. Sheley is not believed to have had a prior relationship with the couple, police said. During the hunt for Sheley, the St. Louis County Police Department issued a bulletin describing him as an \"extremely dangerous\" methamphetamine addict. \"He has stated to his ex-wife that he has more killing to do,\" the bulletin said. According to a Tuesday affidavit by FBI Special Agent Susan Hanson, Sheley invaded a home in Sterling, Illinois -- just a mile from Rock Falls -- on June 14. A woman inside the home told police the man was Sheley, it says. Sheley then took off to Iowa where he made a phone call in Sterling on Saturday  and then went to Missouri, according to the affidavit. A gas station attendant in Galesburg, less than 60 miles from where the call was placed near Davenport, Iowa, told police that he saw Sheley, who appeared to have blood on him, at the gas station, the affidavit stated. A stolen truck belonging to Randall, the victim in Galesburg, was recovered Sunday in Festus, near an Anheuser-Busch distribution plant, authorities said.

Louis Vuitton took eBay to court for selling a range of fake luxury goods online. The fashion company -- home to brands including Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Fendi, Emilio Pucci and Marc Jacobs -- complained it had been hurt by the sale of fake products on eBay. Pierre Godet, an adviser to LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, said the  court's decision was \"an answer to a particularly serious question, on whether the Internet is a free-for-all for the most hateful, parasitic practices.\" eBay said LVMH was trying to crack down on Internet auctions because it was uncomfortable with its business model, which puts sellers rather than brands in control. \"If counterfeits appear on our site, we take them down swiftly,\" eBay spokeswoman Sravanthi Agrawal said. \"But today's ruling is not about counterfeits. Today's ruling is about an attempt by LVMH to protect uncompetitive commercial practices at the expense of consumer choice and the livelihood of law-abiding sellers that eBay empowers every day.\" She said eBay intended to appeal the ruling. The case pit two pillars of their industries -- one old, one new -- in a country whose courts often challenge Internet companies on matters protected elsewhere by freedom of speech. The ruling faulted eBay for \"guilty negligence\" for not doing enough to prevent fake goods from being sold on its site. The court also ruled that eBay was responsible for the \"illicit sale\" of perfumes from the LVMH empire, which can be sold only through the brands' \"selective distribution networks.\" The court barred eBay from running ads for the perfume and cosmetic brands or  face a fine of $79,000 per day. Heather McDonald, partner at law firm Baker Hostetler, said: \"eBay has policies and procedures in place where they will intervene in an action between a buyer and seller if there's a problem, and they profit directly on the basis of every item that is sold on their Web site. \"This gives them an affirmative obligation to take steps to make sure that illegal goods aren't sold, and they certainly have the ability to do that. \"They have been able to make sure that you can't buy a handgun and they have been able to make sure that you cannot buy pornography or prescription narcotics or other medicines on eBay. \"They have the ability to do this, they have just chosen not do and to rest the entire burden of policing eBay on the shoulders of the trademark and copyright holders whose rights are being infringed here.\"", "ec9531cd58e385f0da60e23b2855a3c5ece3f270": "SEOUL, South Korea (CNN)    -- Tens of thousands of South Koreans were demonstrating Saturday on the streets of the capital to protest the government's decision to import what they say is unsafe U.S. beef. South Korean protesters protest against government's policy on U.S. beef imports on Saturday. South Korean police estimate that the crowd in Seoul is about 50,000. No clashes were reported between the protesters and riot police, although ongoing protests have at times turned violent. South Koreans have protested regularly since April when the government announced it would resume importing beef from the United States after a five-year ban. That ban was instituted over a case of mad cow disease in the United States in 2003. The widespread public protests essentially paralyzed the government of President Lee Myung-bak, who replaced seven top aides this month and plans to reshuffle his Cabinet. Tens of thousands of auto workers in South Korea went on strike Wednesday to oppose the government's lifting of the ban. After a series of negotiations, Seoul and Washington came up with a revised agreement on June 21 -- one that limits imports to cattle younger than 30 months old. Animals older than 30 months old are considered at a greater risk for mad cow disease, which can be transmitted to humans. The revised agreement also excludes the import of certain parts believed more susceptible to mad cow disease. The initial deal would have allowed the import of all U.S. beef imports. Scientists believe mad cow disease spreads when farmers feed cattle recycled meat and bones from infected animals. The U.S. banned recycled feeds in 1997. Eating meat products contaminated with the illness has been linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare and fatal malady in humans. Until the 2003 ban, South Korea was the third-largest market for U.S. beef exporters. South Korea's new pro-U.S. president agreed to lift the import ban in April before a summit with U.S. President George W. Bush. But the move provoked a backlash over health concerns spurred in part by false media reports about risks, along with a sense that South Korea had backed down too easily to American pressure. The government has vowed to get tough with the rallies. In Washington, the White House announced that Bush would visit South Korea on August 5-6 before heading to the Beijing Olympics. Bush had originally been expected to go to Seoul next week when he visits Japan for the G-8 summit, but the trip did not materialize amid the protests.

Mandela told cheering fans, \"Your voices carried across the water to inspire us in our prison cells far away. Tonight, we can stand before you free. \"We are honored to be back in London for this wonderful occasion. \"But even as we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. \"Where there is poverty and sickness, including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.

The finale of the concert was scheduled as Queen, Amy Winehouse and Jerry Dammers performing \"Free Nelson Mandela,\" a 1980s hit from the Specials that quickly became an anti-apartheid anthem, but pretty much every act joined them on stage.

Mandela served as his country's first democratically elected president from 1994 to 1999. In recent years, he has campaigned on behalf of HIV and AIDS awareness and has long called the battle against AIDS a basic human right. In 1964, a court sentenced Mandela to life in prison for plotting to overthrow the government by violence. He spent the first 18 years at Robben Island Prison, off Cape Town, South Africa, and later spent time at Pollsmoor prison and Victor Verster Prison, closer to the mainland. While in prison, Mandela became recognized as the most significant black leader in South Africa, and he became a potent symbol of resistance in the anti-apartheid movement. Mandela consistently refused to compromise his political position to obtain his freedom. South African President F.W. de Klerk released Mandela in February 1990 after 27 years in prison.

The price of gold is at historic highs, making new prospects very valuable. Drill samples indicate more than 1 million ounces of gold may lie below what is now rolling Irish countryside, said Richard Conroy, the chairman of Dublin, Ireland-based Conroy Diamonds and Gold. With the price of gold near historic highs, the find could be worth as much as $300 million on the market, Conroy told CNN. The company has been working for 10 years to find gold in a 1,500-square kilometer (600-square-mile) area spanning the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, he said. The site where the company found the gold is near Clontibret, a village in the northern part of Ireland, he said. \"I think it's a major development in Ireland that we now have a significant gold resource,\" Conroy said. \"It's the largest amount of gold, the largest number of ounces, that's ever been reported in Ireland, or indeed in either Britain or Ireland.\" The price of gold is currently around $900 an ounce on global commodities markets. Factoring in costs for mine construction and operation, Conroy said, the gold near Clontibret could fetch roughly $300 million. The company now plans to do more drilling at the site and conduct feasibility studies before moving ahead, he said. An analyst cautioned, however, that the reported amount of gold is still only an estimate. \"Until you've actually mined the stuff, there's always a moderate level of uncertainty,\" said William Tankard, a senior analyst at metals consultancy GFMS in London. One million ounces, if confirmed, would be significant for both Conroy and Ireland, Tankard said. Ireland has small precious metal deposits but nothing as large as Conroy's reported find, Tankard said. Conroy said only one gold mine is currently active in Ireland. \"By no means is it world-leading, but a million ounces is certainly worth thinking about,\" Tankard said.

Farmers have countered that they need to reinvest the profits and that the higher taxes make it difficult for them to make a living.

A Zimbabwe court convicted Mann of trying to buy weapons illegally. He served four years in jail there before being extradited to Equatorial Guinea's capital of Malabo earlier this year to face charges of leading an abortive coup. Mann testified that his former friend Mark Thatcher -- the son of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher -- was a main partner in the plot. Thatcher was arrested along with Mann in 2004, and he pleaded guilty in South Africa the following year to unwittingly bankrolling the plot. He escaped jail time by paying a fine. Thatcher admitted giving $275,000 toward the charter of a helicopter, saying he thought was for commercial purposes and discovered only later it was to be used by mercenaries. But Mann said Thatcher paid $350,000 for a helicopter and a plane which he knew would be used in the plot, and that he attended meetings about the plan with Calil in London. Calil, Mann said, initially asked him to assassinate President Obiang and talked about the possibility of staging a guerrilla war. Mann testified he refused both requests, considering them unethical, but he did agree to help stage a coup. Though he said Thatcher was a top figure in the plot, Mann testified that even Thatcher was under Calil in the group's hierarchy. Mann, appearing in a gray prison outfit, emphasized that he was not the man in charge. Mann's defense lawyer took 45 minutes to question Mann, Channel 4 reported, in contrast to the four hours of prosecution questioning Mann faced. Mann smiled often in the footage shown by Channel 4 and even stuck his tongue out playfully at the camera. After his stint in the British army, Mann was affiliated with the South Africa-based mercenary firm Executive Outcomes. The firm described itself on its now-defunct Web site as a \"military advisory service\" that had played a \"crucial\" role in ending two African civil wars.", "d70dcffc2c07e08cc121d7126ada53dbc479626e": "(CNN)  -- The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill student body president who was killed this year was shot several times, including in her head, according to her autopsy report released Monday. Unsealed warrants show Eve Carson was abducted and then shot by both men. Eve Carson, 22, was found slain on March 5. Carson's autopsy report lists six gunshot wounds, but says two were probably from the same bullet, according to North Carolina's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Carson's death shocked the community and drew national attention. An estimated 10,000 people turned out for a service remembering her. Her autopsy -- released after a North Carolina newspaper filed a court motion to have it unsealed -- describes wounds to various parts of Carson's body. It says shotgun wounds to her head and hand \"most likely represent a single shot with the hand acting as an intermediate target.\" One of the other four wounds was also a gunshot to her head. A separate, handwritten summary of the medical examiner's report says Carson was \"shot multiple times\" and found lying on her back, with one arm bent behind her head. The autopsy says sexual assault testing was done. It does not say whether any sign of sexual assault was found. Two suspects, Demario James Atwater, 22, and Lawrence Alvin Lovette, 17, have been charged with first-degree murder. Lovette's attorney said the warrants against the suspects rely on hearsay. Atwater's attorney cautioned against \"any rush to judgment.\" Court documents released Friday say Carson was kidnapped from her apartment and forced to provide her abductors with ATM access to her bank account before she was shot to death in the early hours of March 5. The documents -- applications for search warrants -- say a confidential informant told police in the days after the death that Atwater had told her he and Lovette had entered Carson's home through an open door and forced Carson to accompany them in her car. The informant said she had talked with Atwater after a picture was displayed on television showing someone attempting to use Carson's ATM card at a convenience store two days after Carson's body was found. The informant said the two men drove Carson to an ATM, obtaining her PIN number from her. \"The CW [informant] learned that Carson was forced into the back seat with Atwater, and Lovette drove Carson's vehicle,\" the court documents said. \"That information is consistent with video footage taken from an ATM camera on that date.\" The witness told police Atwater said the two got about $1,400 from Carson's account. Bank records show that was approximately the amount taken from the account over a two-day period, the documents said. And the informant said that both suspects shot Carson, according to one of the affidavits. \"This information was corroborated by crime scene search information that two separate weapons were used in the homicide,\" the documents said. The documents said police believe Carson was subjected to a sexual assault \"of an unknown nature\" and asked for a search warrant to collect DNA swabs from the suspects. But Orange County, North Carolina, District Attorney Jim Woodall told CNN Friday the collection and testing done on Carson's body was routine, and authorities do not believe she was sexually assaulted. Prosecutors had fought to keep her autopsy sealed. Following a motion by the Raleigh News & Observer newspaper, prosecutors agreed to allow the report's release. Carson, a native of Athens, Georgia, was a pre-medicine student double-majoring in political science and biology. She was a recipient of the university's prestigious Morehead Scholarship and a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society, UNC has said.", "4dc0cef39980df6382f9aee5e150e904fe62965e": "(CNN) -- Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim came out of hiding Monday, and says he has damaging evidence that proves senior members of the government faked evidence for sodomy charges against him.

Cipro is one of the drugs for which the FDA will require a \"black box\" label warning about tendon problems. \"The new language will strengthen the existing warnings,\" said Dr. Edward Cox, director of the FDA's Office of Antimicrobial Products. The FDA is requiring the label warnings and a medication guide for fluoroquinolone drugs, which include Cipro, Levaquin, Avelox, Noroxin and Floxin. The consumer group Public Citizen asked the FDA in August 2006 to put the \"black box\" warning on Cipro and other fluoroquinolones, and also to warn doctors. Earlier this year, Public Citizen filed a lawsuit to force the FDA to take those actions. Public Citizen said Tuesday it was \"pleased\" with the FDA's order but added \"there is still more that the FDA must do.\" \"The FDA is silent on our request that it also send a warning letter to physicians clearly describing possible adverse reactions, such as tendon pain, so that patients can be switched to alternative treatments before tendons rupture,\" the group said. \"We are troubled that the FDA is not doing everything within its power to prevent more people from needlessly suffering disabling tendon ruptures.\" When asked about the lawsuit and why it didn't order the \"black box\" label warning until now, Cox stressed that the FDA included warning information with the drugs from 2001 until 2004, and updated the information last year.  Dr. Gupta explains more on antibiotic risks \u00bb . \"There has been ongoing work to update the labeling of the fluoroquinolone drug products,\" Cox said. \"We have been working on this issue and making progress over time.\" The companies that make the fluoroquinolone drugs will be required to submit label safety changes and the medication guide within 30 days of receiving the notification from the FDA or provide a reason why they do not believe such labeling changes are necessary, Cox said. Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc., which holds licenses for Cipro and Avelox, said it would make the changes requested by the FDA but defended the drugs as \"well-tolerated and effective in all approved indications.\" Schering-Plough markets Cipro and Avelox in the United States under agreement with Bayer. Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which markets Levaquin in the United States, also said it would abide by the FDA's request. Merck & Co., the maker of Noroxin, said it, too, would update the drug's label. But Merck noted it has stopped promotion of Noroxin because of the widespread availability of its generic form. Oscient Pharmaceuticals (Factive), Daiichi Sankyo (Floxin) and Dipomed (Proquin) did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment. The fluoroquinolones drugs can increase the risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture -- which is about 1 in 100,000 -- by three to four times, according to the FDA's Dr. Renata Albrecht. \"This risk is further increased in those over age 60, in kidney, heart, and lung transplant recipients, and with use of concomitant steroid therapy,\" the FDA said in a statement. Albrecht said that sometimes patients have no symptoms before they experience a rupture in their tendon -- commonly their Achilles tendon. \"Sometimes it's been reported on the first day of taking a fluoroquinolone ... a sudden snap or popping sound that is tendon rupture with no preceding warning,\" she said. Normally, she added, that patients experience some pain or inflammation \"a week or two before the patient will rupture.\" Public Citizen, founded in 1971 by consumer activist Ralph Nader, said more than 400 cases of tendon rupture and more than 300 cases of tendonitis in patients using fluoroquinolones were reported between November 1997 and December 2007. \"Because only a small fraction of cases are typically reported to the FDA, the actual number of ruptures and other tendon injuries attributable to the antibiotic is much higher,\" the group said. The FDA would only say that it has received \"hundreds\" of reports of tendon problems linked to fluoroquinolones, without being more specific, citing the ongoing lawsuit. But Cox said \"the FDA continues to receive a considerable number of reports on tendon adverse effects.\" Patients should stop taking fluoroquinolone antibiotics at the first sign of tendon pain, avoid exercise and contact their doctor, the FDA said. Cox said the FDA would not require companies to send letters to doctors alerting them about the connection between tendon problems and the antibiotics. \"It is possible under REMS [Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy] to ask for a letter [to doctors],\" Cox said. \"Certainly for sponsors that would choose to go forward with a letter, we'll be happy to work with them.\"", "19fe2a8e0bef37b495afcc83c2f46b60c56039bf": "UNITY, New Hampshire (CNN) -- The day began with a kiss. Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama leave Washington on Friday for a rally in New Hampshire. Sen. Barack Obama, on the tarmac at Reagan Washington National Airport, reached out to shake Sen.

One of the babies died. Officials at Christus Spohn Hospital South say corrective action was taken after the discovery of the overdoses. The infant was one of 17 who may have received a more concentrated form of heparin than was prescribed, Christus Spohn Hospital South said in a statement. Heparin is an anticoagulant often used to clean the IVs of patients and prevent blood clots from forming in the lines. It came into the public spotlight last year when newborn twins of actor Dennis Quaid nearly died after receiving an overdose at a Los Angeles hospital. Nursing staff at the Corpus Christi hospital discovered the problem Sunday -- two days after the medication is believed to have been first administered, according to Bruce Holstien, president and CEO of Christus Spohn Health System. The hospital said it took corrective measures after the discovery. A preliminary investigation concluded that \"the medication error occurred during the mixing process within the hospital pharmacy,\" Holstein said in a statement. The baby who died \"was seriously ill, and we do not know at this time what role, if any, the higher than expected concentration of heparin played in this baby's death,\" Dr. Richard Davis, chief medical officer for the health system, said Tuesday. \"Our deepest sympathy goes out to this family,\" he said. Twelve of the 16 other babies remain in stable condition in the neonatal intensive care unit, which cares for ill newborns. Three have been discharged, and one is critical and unstable as that baby has been since admission to the unit, Davis said. In November, Quaid's 12-day-old twins, Thomas Boone and Zoe Grace, were undergoing intravenous antibiotic treatment for a staph infection at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. According to standard procedure, nurses were supposed to clean the infants' IV lines with Hep-Lock, a drug containing a small dose of heparin, to allow the lines to flow freely. However, instead of the 10 units of heparin they were supposed to receive, the twins received 10,000 units -- 1,000 times the prescribed amount. The babies survived, apparently with no permanent injury, Quaid later told members of a House committee on government oversight, although there is no way to know whether they will show any long-term effects.", "e4007135fdafe84907e2b018da3a4c7ab853c251": "(CNN) -- Actress Gina Gershon is demanding a retraction from Vanity Fair after the magazine reported \"high-end Hollywood dinner-party gossip\" that former President Clinton \"has been seen visiting\" her in California. Actress Gina Gershon \"is extremely offended\" by the Vanity Fair article, her lawyers say. The lengthy article by the magazine's national editor, Todd Purdum, mentioned the actress along with several other women rumored to be associated with Clinton, all anonymously sourced. \"Todd Purdum's insinuation is a lie, and it is irresponsible journalism,\" said Gershon's publicist, Mara Buxbaum. \"We are demanding a retraction.\" A letter sent by Gershon's attorneys to Vanity Fair editor-in-chief Graydon Carter, obtained by CNN, demanded a published correction and retraction and threatened possible litigation for defamation. The actress appeared in 1995's \"Showgirls\" and the more recent \"P.S. I Love You.\" Gershon \"is extremely offended by the false and defamatory inference that she engaged in an adulterous relationship with the President,\" the letter says, adding that the actress has been in the same room with Clinton three times, always in the presence of at least a dozen people. \"It is apparent that Vanity Fair was intent upon publishing unsubstantiated rumors, and that it avoided learning the true facts so that the truth would not get in the way,\" the letter says. \"Such conduct is reckless and malicious, giving rise to substantial liability for defamation.\" In a statement, Vanity Fair denied that the article indicates any \"improper relationship\" between Clinton and Gershon. \"The story merely examines the concerns of some of Clinton's aides about reports of his behavior,\" the magazine said. \"We don't believe that any correction is warranted.\" Purdum's article, \"The Comeback Id,\" quoted multiple anonymous sources questioning the former president's behavior since leaving the White House. The article suggested that Clinton's personality had changed since his 2004 heart bypass surgery and said there were reports of Clinton \"seeing a lot of women on the road.\" Clinton issued a tirade against Purdum on Monday when asked by Huffington Post writer Mayhill Fowler what he thought of \"the hatchet job somebody did on you in Vanity Fair,\" according to a recording of the exchange posted on the Huffington Post's Web site. \"[He's] sleazy,\" Clinton responded. \"He's a really dishonest reporter.\" Clinton said that he had not read the article but that he was told that \"there's five or six just blatant lies in there. But he's a real slimy guy.\" Calling Purdum a \"scumbag,\" Clinton said \"he's one of the guys that propagated all those lies about Whitewater for Kenneth Starr. He's just a dishonest guy -- can't help it.\" Purdum \"didn't use a single name, he didn't cite a single source in all those things he said,\" the former president said, adding that the article was \"part of the national media's attempt to nail Hillary for Obama. \"Anytime you read a story that slimes a public figure with anonymous quotes, it ought to make the bells go off in your head,\" he said.

Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has rejected demands for the repeal of an export tax. Eduardo Buzzi, president of the Argentine Agrarian Federation, said the organization's directory board will meet Friday to discuss what steps it plans to take in response to President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's announcement. \"We call on farmers across the country to stay calm but to stay on the alert,\" the organization said on its Web site Tuesday. The 44 percent export tax, which applies to soybeans, wheat, corn and sunflower seeds, has caused a three-month-old standoff between the government and farmers. Argentina is the world's second-largest corn exporter and third-largest soybean exporter. On Monday, farmers suspended roadblocks that had snarled traffic across the country, though reports indicated that groups in some rural areas were still blocking roads Tuesday. Kirchner has argued that the tax, which was implemented March 11, pays for increases in seniors' pensions and financial assistance for the poor. She has rejected the farmers' demands for a repeal of the export tax as \"extortion.\" Monday marked the first time Kirchner revealed details of how the government plans to use profits from the tax, which has generated about U.S. $1.5 billion, to lift people out of poverty. \"It is impossible to attack the problem of the poor without distribution of revenue and without touching extraordinary profits,\" she said in a televised address. Kirchner said the Social Redistribution Program will include the construction of 30 hospitals and more than 300 health-care centers, as well as investments in the country's rural roads and in housing. In an apparent criticism of the farmers, she lamented \"the reaction of some who refuse to contribute in the redistribution\" to \"those who have least.\" She apologized, however, at the close of her speech for offending anyone. Analysts suggested that the tax was a \"strong attack\" on on the farmers and their arguments against it. Claudio Loser, a visiting senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue policy analysis center, said it could result in Argentine society being \"less sympathetic to the farmers,\" noting that it was \"surprising\" that the government didn't come up with the plan until the tax was three months old. Loser, who is from Argentina, also predicted that a continuation of the tax would provoke farmers into not investing. Externally, the standoff has had a two-pronged effect on Argentina, he said. \"The conflict has resulted in a loss of market for Argentina,\" he said, as other countries have gone elsewhere for products.

Susan Atkins is led from a Los Angeles grand jury room after her indictment in the 1969 \"Manson murders.\" Suzan Hubbard, director of the Division of Adult Institutions, decided that Susan Atkins' request should not be sent to the sentencing court for consideration, said Terry Thornton, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Hubbard's recommendation is advisory and will not necessarily prevent Atkins' release. The court -- not the department or the state Board of Parole Hearings -- has the final say on whether Atkins should be released, Thornton said. \"They're the only ones legally who can recall the sentence,\"  she added. Atkins, 60, was convicted in the 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate and four others. She had been incarcerated at the California Institution for Women in Corona, California, but has been hospitalized since mid-March. Her request is now before the Board of Parole Hearings, which is conducting an independent investigation and will hear the case during its monthly public meeting, Thornton said. The next meeting is scheduled July 15. Atkins had been held for years at the Corona prison, which earlier determined that she met the criteria for compassionate release under the law, and sent her request to the corrections department. The Board of Parole Hearings will receive public comment, discuss the request in closed session and then announce its recommendation. The board also can decide whether to refer the request to the sentencing court. The court, based in Los Angeles, can either grant or deny Atkins' request. It also can recall her life sentence and resentence Atkins to a lesser term, allowing for her to be paroled. In 2007, the department received 60 compassionate release requests, Thornton said. Ten were approved. Citing privacy rules, prison officials would not disclose the nature of Atkins' illness. Her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse, has been quoted as saying she has terminal brain cancer, according to a blog called Manson Family Today. She also has had a leg amputated, the Los Angeles Times has reported. Atkins, known within the Manson family as \"Sadie Mae Glutz,\" has been in prison since 1971 and has been denied parole 11 times. She is California's longest-serving female inmate. Tate and three houseguests were slain in August 1969 by killers who burst into her Benedict Canyon home. A teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his cottage on the property also was killed. According to historical accounts of the murders, Atkins stabbed Tate, who was 8\u00bd months pregnant, and wrote the word \"pig\" in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski. The following night, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were slain in their home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. The two-day crime spree sent shock waves throughout Los Angeles. All of the killers remain behind bars. Atkins also was convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher Gary Hinman. Atkins, like family leader Charles Manson, received a death sentence. Her punishment was changed to life in prison when the California Supreme Court ruled the state's death penalty unconstitutional in 1972. Atkins is a born-again Christian, according to a Web site maintained by her husband. During her incarceration, the site says, Atkins has worked to help at-risk youth, victims of violent crimes and homeless children. Last month, authorities dug for buried bodies at the Inyo County, California, ranch where Manson and his followers once lived, after police became aware that testing had indicated humans might be buried there.

Apple's iPhone is yet to go on sale outside the U.S. Apple's iPhone, released in the United States two months ago, was engineered to operate for the first two years only on the AT&T system through an exclusive arrangement between Apple and AT&T. It has not yet been sold outside of the U.S. Los Angeles software consultant Brett Schulte, who is not affiliated with the developers, demonstrated the software for CNN Friday evening. An iPhone that had the new software appeared to work on the T-Mobile system just seconds after Schulte replaced the AT&T SIM card with a T-Mobile SIM card. \"It's completely software hacked,\" Schulte said. \"There's no case opening required. It's not required to do any kind of disassembly.\" It took Schulte about two minutes to unlock the iPhone. The developers would not give CNN their last names, saying \"We don't want to be hounded.\" The said they would start selling the software, which they haven't yet priced, as soon as their online payment and customer service systems are ready. They're also waiting for more information from their lawyers. Apple spokeswoman Jennifer Bowcock told CNN her company has no comment. AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said he couldn't speculate on the legality of unlocking the phone, but he added, \"When you sign up, you're signing a two-year contract. You're obligated to pay the bill.\" \"When people buy the iPhone it's clear from our materials it's designed to operate exclusively on AT&T,\" Siegel said. Schulte, however, said it is possible to buy an iPhone without being contractually obligated to AT&T. The developers recently created a Web site -- iPhoneSIMfree.com -- but there is very little information on it and no direct way for anyone to purchase the software. Internet records showed they bought the domain name less than two weeks ago. Two members of the group, who identified themselves only as \"John\" and \"Liu,\" told CNN in a phone interview that a core group of six people on three continents worked to unlock the iPhone as a hobby. They said they are fans of Apple products who thought the iPhone should be made accessible to people who cannot use AT&T. \"I'm not in America and I can't use it,\" said Liu, who would not reveal the country in which he lives. \"It's not fair.\" Asked if he thought modifying the iPhone was legal, he said \"That's a very good question. I truly believe it is.\" John and Liu said they have not been contacted by either Apple or AT&T, but said that could change the moment their software goes on sale. Earlier this month, a teenager figured out a way to unlock the iPhone, but his method required disassembly of the unit.

Susan Atkins, Califorina's longest-serving female inmate, is shown in her most recent mug shot. Atkins, 60, has been diagnosed with brain cancer and has had a leg amputated, her attorney said. In June, she requested the release, available to terminally ill inmates with less than six months to live. The California Board of Parole Hearings' decision -- posted Tuesday on its Web site -- came after a public hearing on Atkins' request. It means the request will not be forwarded to the Los Angeles Superior Court that sentenced Atkins. The court would have had the final say on Atkins' release. Her attorney, Eric P. Lampel, called the parole board's decision \"unfortunate.\" \"[The board] ignored the vast majority of evidence presented,\" Lampel said. \"There was a huge amount of pro-compassionate release testimony from many witnesses. It apparently fell on deaf ears.\" Known within the Manson Family as Sadie Mae Glutz, Atkins and four others were convicted in connection with the deaths of five people, including Tate, in August 1969. According to historical accounts of the murder, Atkins stabbed Tate, who was eight months pregnant, and scrawled the word \"pig\" in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with director Roman Polanski. By her own admission, Atkins held Tate down and rejected her pleas for mercy, stabbing the pregnant woman 16 times. Atkins' request roused long-dormant memories of the two-day killing spree that terrorized Los Angeles and left seven people dead. It polarized those who were involved in the case -- and even those who weren't -- over whether she should die behind bars. Atkins told a 1993 parole board that Tate pleaded for her unborn child's life as she held her down. \"She asked me to let her baby live,\" Atkins said. \"... I told her I didn't have any mercy on her.\" Three of Tate's houseguests were also slain by the killers, as was a teenager visiting the home's caretaker in his cottage out back. Atkins was also convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher Gary Hinman. One of the first people Atkins confessed to was Virginia Graham, who shared a cell with her before investigators determined the Manson Family was responsible for the murders. Graham said last month she believed Atkins should die in prison. \"She showed that poor woman absolutely no mercy, none,\" Graham said. \"So why should anybody show her mercy at this time?\" Sharon Tate's sister, Debra, has staunchly opposed Atkins' release. \"She will be set free when judged by God,\" Debra Tate has said. \"It's important that she die in incarceration.\" Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley said Monday he was strongly opposed to the release, saying in a letter to the board it would be \"an affront to people of this state, the California criminal justice system and the next of kin of many murder victims.\" Cooley noted in his letter that Atkins was initially sentenced to death, like others in the Manson Family, including its leader, Charles Manson. Their sentences were commuted to life in prison in 1972, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty laws as they were written at the time. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Tuesday he was also opposed to releasing Atkins. \"I don't believe in [compassionate release],\" the governor told reporters. \"I think that they have to stay in, they have to serve their time.\" Even if Atkins is dying, Schwarzenegger said, \"Those kinds of crimes are just so unbelievable that I'm not for the compassionate release.\" Earlier, Suzan Hubbard, director of adult prisons in California, also recommended against granting Atkins' request. Vincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted Atkins and other members of the Manson Family, said he supported her release, if only to save the state money. Through Monday, the cost for Atkins' medical care since she was hospitalized March 18 totaled more than $1.15 million, and the costs for guarding her hospital room are more than $308,000, said California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokeswoman Terry Thornton. Terminally ill inmates rarely are allowed compassionate release, records show. In 2007, 60 such requests were made to the department, Thornton has said. Ten were approved. Atkins, who has been incarcerated since 1971, is California's longest-serving female inmate. According to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse, she is now a born-again Christian. During her incarceration, the site says, Atkins worked to help at-risk youth, violent crime victims and homeless children, among others. The Web site does not mention Atkins' illness. Lampel said last month Atkins is paralyzed on one side. \"She can talk a little bit,\" Lampel said. \"She can't sit up in bed without assistance, and obviously she can't walk around because she's an amputee.\" Atkins has expressed remorse for her crimes. \"I know the pain I caused Mrs. Tate,\" she said at a parole board hearing in 1985. ln May, authorities dug for buried bodies at the Inyo County, California, ranch where Manson and his followers once lived, after police became aware that testing had indicated human remains might be buried there. Nothing was found, authorities said. CNN's Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.", "d86d9a4e0b39556578f24ff54ed82716f0375fdb": "(CNN)  -- Sen. Hillary Clinton said Sunday some people are using her controversial reference to Robert F. Kennedy's assassination to suggest that she meant something \"completely unthinkable.\" Sen. Hillary Clinton says her supporters urge her to stay in the race until it is over. Her campaign also accused the rival Obama campaign of \"inflaming\" the situation and purposely taking her words out of context. But the Obama campaign said it was not trying to \"stir the issue up.\" In an editorial in the New York Daily News, the Democratic presidential hopeful also acknowledged her dwindling chances of winning the nomination, saying she is aware of \"the odds\" against her. Headlined \"Hillary: Why I continue to run,\" the editorial began with an explanation of her reference to the assassination when she was speaking to the Argus Leader newspaper in South Dakota. She said she was pointing out that presidential primary campaigns have continued into June. \"Almost immediately, some took my comments entirely out of context and interpreted them to mean something completely different -- and completely unthinkable,\" she wrote.  Watch Hillary's camp insist the remark had nothing to do with Obama \u00bb . Clinton said the newspaper's editor and Bobby Kennedy Jr. issued statements arguing that was the meaning of her remark. No other member of the Kennedy family has issued a public statement on the matter. \"I realize that any reference to that traumatic moment for our nation can be deeply painful -- particularly for members of the Kennedy family, who have been in my heart and prayers over this past week,\" she said, in a reference to Sen. Edward Kennedy's diagnosis with brain cancer. \"And I expressed regret right away for any pain I caused. \"But I was deeply dismayed and disturbed that my comment would be construed in a way that flies in the face of everything I stand for -- and everything I am fighting for in this election.\" Some people -- particularly a number of bloggers -- have suggested she was imagining the possibility that Sen. Barack Obama, the likely nominee, could be assassinated. After Clinton's initial remarks to the newspaper were reported, the Obama campaign issued a statement saying the comment \"was unfortunate and has no place in this campaign.\" But Obama himself later said, \"I don't think that Senator Clinton intended anything by it,\" and that \"we should put it behind us.\" Clinton campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe, in an interview Sunday, criticized the Obama campaign's first move. \"It's unfortunate -- a hyped-up press over Memorial Day weekend, the Obama campaign inflaming it, tried to take these words out of context,\" he told \"Fox News Sunday.\" Asked about the remark by Obama himself, McAuliffe responded, \"That's great, but Friday they were all part of this process. The press secretary came out and attacked Senator Clinton and got it going so the story would be around for three days.\" Howard Wolfson, a Clinton adviser, told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that the Obama campaign's first statement critical of Clinton was \"unfortunate.\" But Obama's chief strategist David Axelrod told ABC's \"This Week\" that \"we take her at her word,\" and he added, \"We're beyond that issue now, so certainly we're not trying to stir the issue up.\" The program's host, George Stephanopoulos, noted that a member of Obama's staff sent to the media Saturday a \"searing commentary\" by MSNBC's Keith Olbermann slamming Clinton for her remark. \"Mr. Olbermann did his commentary and he had his opinion,\" Axelrod responded, adding, \"As far as we're concerned, this issue is done.\" On another front, Axelrod slammed Clinton for suggesting she leads Obama in the popular vote. Clinton has been making that argument, based on figures that include Florida and Michigan, even though Obama took his name off the ballot in Michigan and neither candidate campaigned in Florida. The Democratic Party discounted both states' primaries before they took place. \"It would take some very tortured math and tortured logic to say that she's ahead in the popular vote,\" Axelrod told ABC. He added, \"This isn't 'American Idol,' OK? This is a nominating process. We have rules. We elect delegates state by state.\" In her column, Clinton said she believes she can still \"win on the merits.\" \"I am not unaware of the challenges or the odds of my securing the nomination -- but this race remains extraordinarily close, and hundreds of thousands of people in upcoming primaries are still waiting to vote,\" she wrote. She added that her parents \"did not raise me to be a quitter -- and too many people still come up to me at my events, grip my arm and urge me not to walk away before this contest is over.\" She also said she is running \"because I believe staying in this race will help unite the Democratic Party. I believe that if Senator Obama and I both make our case -- and all Democrats have the chance to make their voices heard -- in the end, everyone will be more likely to rally around the nominee.\" She repeated her vow to campaign for Obama if he gets the nomination, and wrote, \"No matter what happens in this primary, I am committed to unifying this party.\" Obama was in Middleton, Connecticut, where he was standing in for the ailing Edward Kennedy who was scheduled to deliver the commencement at Wesleyan University.  Watch Obama tell graduates they have an obligation \u00bb . The theme of Obama's speech was service, and the senator asked graduates to volunteer their time at home and abroad to fight poverty, preserve peace and protect the environment . \"But I hope you'll remember, during those times of doubt and frustration, that there is nothing naive about your impulse to change this world,\" he said. \"Because all it takes is one act of service -- one blow against injustice -- to send forth that tiny ripple of hope that Robert Kennedy spoke of.\"", "d10d57811499caa54276d3e14f89c45cb1a8958f": "(CNN) -- North Korea's apparent cooperation with nations seeking to end its nuclear weapons ambitions -- six years after a deal collapsed and two years after testing a bomb -- may lead to questions about why it would play ball now. Some signs show North Korean leader Kim Jong Il does intend to drop his nuclear weapon program, experts say. One school of thought: The communist nation, in desperate economic straits, has long been willing to drop its program for better relations with the United States. But mistakes on both sides interfered, according to Jim Walsh, a national security analyst. North Korea could be trying to achieve survival through deceit, intending to keep its nuclear weapons as blackmail for better treatment, analysts suggest. But those making a case for North Korea's sincerity, Walsh said, would say it must \"do the things economically that [it needs] to do to avoid collapse.\" \"Having nuclear weapons when the regime is collapsing won't do them much good,\" said Walsh, a research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. North Korea, following a 2007 agreement with five nations including the U.S., handed over a declaration of its nuclear program on Thursday. The nation also took steps to disable a reactor that officials acknowledge helped extract plutonium to build nuclear weapons. On Friday, it destroyed the reactor's cooling tower -- significant because the tower would take a year or longer to rebuild.  Watch the tower being demolished. \u00bb . After North Korea's declaration, President Bush said Thursday that he intends to move North Korea from the U.S. list of states that sponsor terrorism. Down the line, North Korea would receive economic and energy assistance if the U.S. and other nations agree it is complying with other efforts to dismantle its nuclear program. North Korea has been heavily sanctioned in the past because of its nuclear program. Stephen Hadley, the U.S. national security adviser, told reporters Thursday that the terror list was one incentive for North Korea to drop its nuclear ambitions. \"I think it is important to them not to be on a list that says 'enemies' and not to be on a list that says 'supporters of terror,'\" Hadley said. Walsh said North Korea has been weakened by sanctions and its lack of arable land, leading to a population unable to feed itself. \"It can't grow enough food,\" Walsh said. \"And they've got to attract foreign investors.\" He said North Korea was better off in the days of the Soviet Union, when it had an ample amount of communist nations with which to trade. But the Soviet Union collapsed, and many other nations turned away from communism, leaving North Korea increasingly isolated. \"Geostrategically, North Korea was growing weaker, and everyone around them was growing stronger,\" Walsh said. In 1994, North Korea pledged to the U.S. that it would freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for international aid, including help building two power-producing nuclear reactors. By 2000, however, North Korea was complaining that not all the aid was coming as promised. In 2002, the U.S. accused North Korea of working on a secret nuclear weapons program, and the U.S. said North Korea admitted doing so. Countries including the U.S. halted oil supplies, and North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It conducted an underground test of a nuclear weapon in 2006. Walsh said both sides haven't fully lived up to previous agreements. The U.S., he said, promised normalized trade at one point but didn't follow through. Jon Wolfsthal, senior fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' international security program, said North Korea has been \"remarkably consistent\" regarding its reactions to U.S. positions. \"When we've engaged them directly, they have responded. And when we have reduced our commitment, to our engagement ... they have responded negatively,\" Wolfsthal said. Wolfsthal said China -- which provides oil and food aid to North Korea -- has been instrumental in getting North Korea to cooperate. \"China has gone from being an uninvested ... mediator to being a true participant in this process -- from a country that originally wanted to help the U.S. and North Korea work out their differences to a state that has worked to convince North Korea to meet its obligations,\" Wolfsthal said. Wolfsthal said he believes China was embarrassed by North Korea's nuclear test, and shifted course. \"I think that over time, the United States has helped China see that North Korea's unpredictable behavior destabilizes their own backyard,\" he said. Walsh and Wolfsthal said another theory has it that North Korea is only playing with negotiators and intends to keep its nuclear program and weapons as a security blanket. Expanding on that possibility, Wolfsthal said North Korea leader Kim Jong Il could keep the country's nuclear arsenal but agree not to produce any more nuclear weapons. \"Everybody's speculating. None of us has met Kim Jong Il,\" Wolfsthal said. Walsh said the West doesn't have hard evidence to determine North Korea's intentions. \"But so far, the evidence is pretty strongly on the side of North Korea wanting a real bargain,\" Walsh said.", "66646c49afb65308491ec8ca6db79aa76263cc69": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's troubled central bank introduced $100 billion banknotes Saturday in a desperate bid to ease the recurrent cash shortages plaguing the inflation-ravaged economy. A shopper displays a $500 million Zimbabwean bank note. The bills officially come into circulation Monday, although they were on the foreign currency dealers market Saturday. As high as they are, though, the bills still aren't enough to buy a loaf of bread. They can buy only four oranges. The new note is equal to just one U.S. dollar. Once-prosperous Zimbabwe has seen an unprecedented economic meltdown since it gained independence in 1980, with the official inflation rate now at 2.2 million percent. Gideon Gono, governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, said the new notes are for \"the convenience of the banking public and corporate sector\" in light of price hikes. \"The RBZ has noted with concern the unjustifiable and incessant general increases in prices of goods and services. It is therefore appealing to the business community to follow ethical business practices as well as take an interest in the plight of the general public,\" Gono said in a statement dated Friday. Zimbabwe started issuing large bank notes in December, starting with denominations of $250,000. In January, the government issued bills in denominations of $1 million, $5 million, and $10 million -- and in May, it issued bills from $25 million and $50 million up to $25 billion and $50 billion. The new bills are actually bearer checks and have an expiration date of December 31. Zimbabwe has not had formal currency since the introduction of bearer checks as a temporary measure in 2003. \"The RBZ is fighting a losing battle,\" economist John Robertson said in Harare. \"As long as the inflation remains high, cash shortages will persist. There is need to address the inflation by increasing production so that too goods do not [cost] a lot of money.\"", "7fbd6d867def06f6ae4c051562dc36ab8d0038c0": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Misha Di Bono zips around town in her Infiniti sport-utility vehicle, breezy and unconcerned about the price of gas.

That's because she gets $500 a month -- plus free gas -- for turning her car into a rolling billboard for Jobing.com, the online recruiting company she works for. \"People used to tease me about the 'Jobing' mobile, and now they're like, 'Oh, we'll get Misha to drive,' \" she said, standing next to her decal-covered car. Jobing.com might be the most extreme example of how companies are helping employees during the current gas crunch.

Watch a rolling billboard for your company \u00bb . \"There's no question companies are feeling the pinch,\" said John Challenger, the chief executive officer of global outplacement company Challenger, Gray and Christmas. \"It's an important issue because no company wants to lose its people.\" His firm recently surveyed about 100 human resources executives at white-collar and blue-collar companies. The survey found that 57 percent of the companies offer programs to help ease commutes. The most popular option was reducing the work week from five eight-hour days to four 10-hour days. Twenty-three percent of the companies polled have such an option, Challenger said.  Calculator: How much do you need to work to pay your gas? \u00bb . \"We're at a watershed time of how people go to work,\" he said. \"Maybe the gas crisis will be the real trigger.\" Other incentives: Twenty percent of the companies offer carpools, and 18 percent pay for the cost of public transportation. Only 14 percent of the companies offer telecommuting options, the poll found. The survey reports that companies had seen a recent jump in carpooling of 43 percent and a 23 percent increase in the use of public transportation. Still, 31 percent of the companies saw no increase in their employees' commuting behaviors.  See gas prices around the country \u00bb . Some of the companies have had the incentives for years, but it's taken the soaring gas prices for employees to look more closely at the programs. \"It's something that is much more important than two years ago,\" Challenger said. \"It's hard to get away from, because you're constantly going back to the gas station.\" He added, \"It's hitting people's radar screens now.\" One company offering generous commuting benefits is online giant Yahoo, which rewards employees who organize carpools, ride bikes to work and take company shuttles to and from offices. Yahoo rewards these green-conscious commuters with free movie tickets, lunches, massages and other benefits. iReport: How is your company helping you . The company recently hired an \"employee transportation coordinator\" to help devise even more incentives. \"We've really been listening to our employees to make sure we help them find ways to make the cost of the commute a little less excessive,\" said Barbary Brunner, a Yahoo vice president. But it is the Jobing.com vehicle that is most eye-popping. Company spokesman Joe Cockrell says the company started the rolling billboard cars in 2001, but only three executives took part in it. But now, 60 percent of its 270 employees nationwide drive the cars.   Watch a shift from marketing ploy to employee benefit \u00bb . \"This year, for the first time, we've had a long waiting list for our wrap,\" Cockrell says. \"It's basically a huge sticker that goes on your car and should last in theory about three to four years.\" It costs the company about $3,000 to $4,000 to turn the cars into rolling billboards. They do have rules: The car can't be older than three years, and employees must take a driving safety course and have clean driving records. Once the cars are wrapped, employees shouldn't flip the bird at other drivers. The company did have to \"unwrap\" one employee's car because he got too many speeding tickets. Cockrell says the program has proved to be a huge win-win. \"These are mobile billboards, and wherever our employees go, so does that billboard.\" Di Bono, who works in community relations, says she loves it, too. She says the cost of filling her tank has doubled in recent years. Now, her company pays her to drive her car. \"They pay for everything,\" she said. \"They pay for me to go to all my appointments and anything I want to do on my own time.\" She added, \"You'd be a fool not to take advantage of it.\" Although many people across the nation are seeking help from their offices, an iReporter in West Virginia recently stopped using his company car and began using his old clunker again. Maurice Alouf's company paid for his V-8 Chrysler sedan, but he says it guzzled gas on his 80-mile round-trip commute. The company didn't offer a gas allowance, and it was costing him more than $60 a week to fill up.

During the \"Women for Obama\" event, the Illinois senator recounted how his mother, a single mom who put herself through school, once had to \"swallow her pride\" and accept food stamps to feed her family. He also recalled how his grandmother worked her way from secretary to the vice president of a bank. \"But I also saw how she ultimately hit a glass ceiling -- how men no more qualified than she was kept moving up the corporate ladder ahead of her,\" he said. Obama highlighted the struggles of his wife to balance the responsibilities of her job and parenting -- and admitted that he was somewhat complicit in the situation in which most of the parenting duties fall to his wife.  Watch Obama talk about the women who shaped him \u00bb . \"As the son, grandson and husband of hard-working mothers, I don't accept an America that makes women choose between their kids and their careers,\" Obama said. \"We take it for granted that women are the backbone of our families, but we too often ignore the fact that women are also the backbone of our middle class. \"And we won't truly have an economy that puts the needs of the middle class first until we ensure that when it comes to pay and benefits at work, women are treated like equal partners,\" he said, urging a commitment to equal pay for women. He urged \"standing up for paid leave, and paid sick leave, because no one should be punished for getting sick or dealing with a family crisis.\" Later on Thursday, Obama traveled to Fairfax, Virginia, to unveil a plan meant to increase women's economic security. The plan includes a tax credit of up to $1,000 for families, an increase in the minimum wage and tax cuts to help working women pay for child care, among other provisions. Clinton, who introduced Obama, urged her supporters to back the Illinois senator, saying, \"It is critical that we join forces. The Democratic Party is a family -- sometimes dysfunctional.\"  Watch Clinton make her case for Obama \u00bb . \"We shared this remarkable journey, and I could not be prouder to have this opportunity in front of so many of my friends and supporters to express my confidence in his candidacy and my commitment to ensuring that he will take the oath of office come next January 2009,\" she said. Obama, in turn, praised Clinton for her historic presidential run, saying, \"While this campaign has shown us how far we have to go, we also know that because of what Hillary accomplished, my daughters and yours look at America and themselves a little differently today.\"  Watch why Obama and Clinton are appearing together \u00bb . Despite the public calls for unity, some of Clinton's supporters have been hesitant to fall in behind Obama. With Clinton's debt yet to be paid off, some of her supporters are balking at the idea of donating to Obama -- especially if he does not choose her to be his running mate. \"I certainly know there are lots of people who are withholding their money,\" said Lynn Forester de Rothschild, one of Clinton's \"Hill-raisers\" who raised over $100,000 for the former first lady. Watch why some Clinton backers are balking \u00bb . \"This is a hard decision for me personally because frankly I don't like him. I feel like he is an elitist. I feel like he has not given me reason to trust him,\" Rothschild said. That sentiment may be sending some Clinton fans into Sen. John McCain's court. According to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released last week, the number of Clinton supporters who say they plan to defect to the Republican presidential nominee's camp is down from a month ago -- but numbers of those who say they plan to vote for Obama are also down. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida, spent two days in New York this week with disaffected Clinton supporters. \"It's not unexpected that they wouldn't just automatically shift over to Obama, because they're not the typical Democratic supporters that just automatically shift over,\" she said. \"They need to be wooed. They need to be won over.\"", "1ba0f66a7f4f23171634a3455893f4d5b8b94db4": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Monday discussed a \"general time horizon\" for any American troop withdrawals from Iraq, al-Maliki's office said. Sen. Barack Obama rides in a helicopter Monday with Gen. David Petraeus in Baghdad, Iraq. Obama -- who has made ending the Iraq war a cornerstone of his run for office -- engaged in what were described as productive talks with al-Maliki during a trip to Iraq. The Iraqi government has been pushing for the United States to set a general timetable to spell out troop withdrawals. Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi also met with Obama Monday and told reporters afterward they discussed the security agreement. \"I told Sen. Obama (that) Iraqi and American negotiations regarding this are ongoing, and today new Iraqi-American negotiations on this agreement have started with Iraqi written proposals and have a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq,\" he said. The Bush administration has opposed timetables for troop withdrawals. But al-Maliki and President Bush last week agreed to a \"general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals\" on troop cuts. The prime minister reiterated that principle with Obama, according to a statement from al-Maliki's office. \"Developments of the situation and the circumstances is what will decide the presence of foreign troops in Iraq, but without keeping open-ended dates,\" al-Maliki said, according to a statement from his office. \"With the developments on the ground, we can set a vision and clear horizons regarding this issue, and this is a view both sides agree on in the ongoing negotiations.\" Al-Maliki's office quoted Obama as saying he is \"supportive and committed to preserving the gains achieved by the Iraqi government\" under al-Maliki's leadership and that he admires the prime minister's courage. Obama has proposed withdrawing U.S. combat troops from Iraq within 16 months of taking office. Spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said the Iraqi government's \"vision\" is that most U.S. combat troops would be out of Iraq by 2010. Asked if that stance is part of the current negotiations, al-Dabbagh said, \"No. This is the Iraqi vision.\" iReport.com: Tell us the most important thing the next president needs to know about Iraq . A German magazine on Saturday quoted al-Maliki as saying he backed Obama's proposal, but al-Dabbagh has said that his remarks \"were misunderstood, mistranslated and not conveyed accurately.\" In a statement Sunday, the magazine, Der Spiegel, said it \"stands by its version of this interview.\" In the magazine interview, al-Maliki did not indicate that he was endorsing Obama over Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee. McCain does not think American troops should return to the United States until Iraqi forces are capable of maintaining a safe, democratic state. He has been a strong advocate of the \"surge\" -- the 2007 escalation of U.S. troops -- and has said troops should stay in Iraq as long as needed. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal -- who's been mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick for McCain -- on Monday criticized Obama's push to remove troops in 16 months as an \"arbitrary timetable based on politics versus a plan based on the actual results on the ground.\" \"One of the reasons I'm supporting [McCain] -- he has made it clear he would rather lose an election than lose a war. He's made it very clear -- let's listen to the commanders on the ground,\" Jindal said on CNN's \"American Morning.\" McCain last week chided Obama for laying out his plans for Iraq and Afghanistan before talking to Gen. David Petraeus, the head of U.S. troops in Iraq. Obama met with Petraeus and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, in Baghdad on Monday. He also met with Tariq al-Hashimi, a Sunni Arab who is one of Iraq's two vice presidents; Lt. Gen. Lloyd Austin, commander of Multi-National Corps-Iraq; British Maj. Gen. Barney White Spunner, commander of Multi-National Division South East; and Maj. General Abdul Aziz, the Iraqi army's 14th Division commander. Obama's stop in Iraq marks his second visit to the country. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee's trip abroad began in Kuwait and Afghanistan and will go on to Jordan, Israel, the West Bank, Germany, France and Britain. The senator from Illinois first visited Iraq in 2006.  See the stops on Obama's trip \u00bb . Obama arrived Monday afternoon in the southern city of Basra, according to U.S. Embassy spokesman Armand Cucciniello. Obama is traveling with Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a leading Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Sen. Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee and is an outspoken critic of the Iraq war. Obama has said that if he's elected, he would commit more troops to Afghanistan and would order the military to end the war in Iraq, which he has called a \"dangerous distraction\" from the Afghan battle. Obama spent Saturday and Sunday in Afghanistan, where he met with U.S. troops at three bases and with Afghan President Hamid Karzai -- a leader the Democratic senator has criticized for doing too little to rebuild the war-torn nation.  Watch Obama meet Karzai, U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan \u00bb . The fight in Afghanistan recently has become a more pressing issue on the political radar. More coalition forces have died in Afghanistan than in Iraq in May, June and so far in July. Last week, in a major address laying out his foreign policy position, Obama said, \"As should have been apparent to President Bush and Sen. McCain, the central front in the war on terror is not Iraq, and it never was.\" He said part of his strategy would be \"taking the fight to al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\" CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Frederik Pleitgen and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.", "3131e8ba238a31d83cad00bc7b02933b0a3587b3": "KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Lawmakers in Nepal will vote Saturday to pick the country's first president since it became a republic. Nepal became a republic after the deposal of King Gyanendra Shah earlier this year. The country's newly elected Constituent Assembly abolished a 239-year monarchy following elections in April. But with no one party winning a majority of the seats, it is unclear who may become president. The position is largely ceremonial. But a president will swear in whoever is picked as the new prime minister. The three main political parties continued to negotiate over whom to name president. The Nepali Congress wants outgoing prime minister and party president Girija Prasad Koirala for the position. The Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) wants its leader. But the Maoists -- which won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority -- do not favor either of the two men. They want a non-political figure as president.

Speaking to reporters ahead of this week's summit of the Group of Eight industrialized nations in Japan, Bush said he did not need to skip the ceremony to show his position on religious freedom and human rights in China. He said if he failed to attend the Games it would \"make it more difficult to be able to speak more frankly with the Chinese leadership.\" Bush said he would raise concerns when he meets Chinese President Hu Jintao at the Olympics, but he was also \"looking forward to cheering the U.S. athletes.\" He said it was good for them \"to see their president waving that flag.\" Japan's Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda also said he would attend the opening ceremony despite concerns about human rights in China that prompted some other European leaders to boycott the event. Bush and Fukuda took questions from reporters at the picturesque lakeside resort of Toyako on the northern island of Hokkaido, where the G-8 summit will begin Monday.  Watch Bush, first lady arrive in Japan \u00bb . Bush said he and Fukuda discussed the United States' recent decision to lift some sanctions against North Korea and remove the communist nation from the State Department's list of state sponsors of terror. Bush assured Japan that the issue of North Korea's past kidnappings of Japanese citizens will not be ignored by the United States. He told Fukuda that he was \"fully aware of the sensitivity of the issue in your country\" and that \"the United States will not abandon you on this issue.\" North Korea has admitted to abducting 11 Japanese citizens -- to teach its spies Japanese language and culture -- but had insisted the abduction issue was resolved. Holding a book about a young Japanese girl abducted by North Korea, Bush said as the father of two girls he \"can't imagine what it would be like to have a daughter disappear.\" Bush said North Korea's recent destruction of a water-cooling tower at its now-defunct nuclear facility and its declaration outlining its plutonium program are positive steps, but there are \"more to be taken.\" Lifting sanctions would not weaken the pressure on North Korea to be forthcoming on the abduction issue or in nuclear negotiations, the U.S. president said. Bush said North Korea remains the most sanctioned nation in the world and that \"delisting did not get rid of their sanctions.\" Fukuda, who is chairing the G-8 meetings, said global warming would be high on the agenda but that he could not predict what might result from this week's talks. Fukuda said he believes the United States \"has not lost its sense of direction\" on the issue. \"Our views are gradually converging,\" he said. Bush said the United States \"will be constructive\" in the global warming talks \"but if China and India do not share that same aspiration, we're not going to solve the problem.\" Bush said the United States and Japan leads the world in research on clean technologies. He said Japan's advances in battery technology will some day mean that Americans \"will use batteries in cars that look like cars, not golf carts.\" As world leaders began arriving for the summit, more than 1,000 people protested in northern Japan against the event. Demonstrators urged leaders to take urgent measures to stop global warming, grant indigenous people greater rights, combat world poverty and battle discrimination.  Watch police tangle with protesters \u00bb . Soaring oil and food prices and possible steps against Zimbabwe were also likely to be high on the agenda at the summit. With fewer than 200 days left in his term, Bush says he will press other G-8 leaders to follow through on their commitments from earlier summits, but has warned there is nothing he or anyone else can do in the short term about oil prices. Bush's main economic goal at the summit may be defensive, said David Gergen, former adviser to presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. \"What's essential in this summit for George W. Bush is to make sure the world economy does not spin downward,\" he said. Bush has downplayed what he and other G-8 leaders can accomplish on the economic front. \"One thing we need to make clear when I'm with our partners is that we're not going to become protectionists, that we believe in free trade and open markets,\" Bush said Wednesday. A former administration official who served on the National Security Council under Bush says the G-8's purpose is not to come up with quick solutions. \"This is not a meeting of heads of state that leads to a treaty.

Check out a vehicle history report to make sure your new used car won't blow smoke down the highway. If you're buying a used car, whether from a dealer or someone who put an ad in the paper, you'll want to know as much about it as you can. Even without anyone trying to deceive you, the vehicle may have problems you can't see from a simple visual inspection or even a short test drive. A vehicle history report prepared by a third party is one way to know what you're getting. Combining information from state DMVs (Departments of Motor Vehicles) and RMVs (Registry of Motor Vehicles) as well as police reports and other sources, a vehicle history report can give you a comprehensive overview of where the car's been. Here are some things to look for -- or look out for -- when you get a report on a vehicle. None of these things is necessarily a reason not to buy a car, but you shouldn't make a decision without asking about anything you see on a vehicle history: . Many owners . The more garages a car's been in, the less likely it's been lovingly cared for all its life. Not everyone is as responsible about car care as you are. Rental cars and former taxis, for example, will often have undergone a lot of abuse, although they tend to be quite inexpensive. Location, location, location . Some parts of the country are more car-friendly than others. Winter storms (with their accompanying salted roads) can be rough on cars, as obviously can floods, excessive heat or even sea air. Cars that have been where these are common may have hidden damage. Name and description . Be sure the car in the report is the same as the car you're looking at. Carefully reviewing the vehicle description is one way to avoid various types of vehicle fraud, like VIN cloning. A cloned vehicle involves using a vehicle identification number (VIN) from a legally owned, non-stolen vehicle to mask the identity of a similar make/model stolen vehicle. Reports, should include detailed descriptions of the vehicle, so you can make sure the car you're reading about is the same as the one you're looking at. Suspicious markings . Keep an eye out for records of body work that might indicate a prior unreported incident. Vehicle history reports, like those from CARFAX, can be very comprehensive. In the case of CARFAX, the company's database contains more than five billion records from thousands of public and private sources, including all DMVs in the United States and Canada and thousands of vehicle inspection stations, auto auctions, fleet management and rental agencies, automobile manufacturers, and fire and police departments.", "c977693b405a89cec98e53b05199e608fd6adeca": "NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- President George W. Bush called India's prime minister Thursday to push a proposed nuclear partnership that sparked an unsuccessful no-confidence vote against the Indian leader this week, a White House spokesman said. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh won a confidence vote despite opposition to the nuclear deal. \"Both leaders expressed their desire to see the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear issue move forward as expeditiously as possible,\" Gordon Johndroe said. The phone call took place two days after Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh narrowly survived the no-confidence vote in the lower house of Parliament. The vote was sparked by concerns from the opposition that India was kowtowing to the U.S. The tentative deal was announced in 2006 and signed by Bush and Singh a year ago. Under the agreement, which will need to be approved by the U.S. Congress, India would have access to U.S. nuclear fuel and technology for its civilian nuclear power plants. That would happen even though New Delhi, which tested nuclear weapons in 1974 and 1998, has declined to join international non-proliferation agreements. In return, India has promised that it would not transfer the fuel and equipment to its weapons program, and it would allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect at least 14 of its 22 nuclear plants. The plan would also expand U.S.-Indian cooperation in energy and satellite technology. The plan was approved by India's Cabinet last year, and does not have to be ratified by the parliament. The leaders of India's two communist parties -- which hold about 60 seats in Parliament -- have accused Singh of surrendering India's sovereignty to the United States with the deal. A no-confidence vote would have forced Singh to resign, and required the government to hold early elections unless a new coalition could have been formed. The Congress Party-led coalition has governed India since 2004. Tuesday's 275-256 vote was so crucial to the survival of Singh's government that five members of parliament serving prison sentences were freed to cast votes -- under the watchful eyes of their jailers. Shortly after Singh survived the vote, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino praised the deal as \"a good one for everybody.\" \"It's good for India because it would help provide them a source for energy that they need, one that is nonpolluting and one that doesn't emit greenhouse gas emissions,\" she said. \"And we think that we can move forward with this. If their legislature lets it move forward, then we can do the same here and then we'll be able to get this wrapped up.\"", "c84e272a80fa95f863e016bc54df0841fd83fc12": "TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Twenty-nine people convicted of various crimes, ranging from murder to being a public nuisance while drunk, were hanged in Iran, state TV said.

Supervisory Mining Engineer Joe Zelanko on Thursday describes the earth movements at Crandall Canyon mine. Insufficient pillar support and activity in areas that should not have been mined caused the August Crandall Canyon mine collapse, federal investigators found. The government fined the mine operator, Genwal Resources, $1.34 million \"for violations that directly contributed to the deaths of six miners last year,\" plus nearly $300,000 for other violations. The government also levied a $220,000 fine against a mining consultant, Agapito Associates, \"for faulty analysis of the mine's design.\" The mine's owner had insisted that earth movement detected at the time of the collapse had caused the disaster. But investigators found instead that the collapse caused the earth movement. \"It was not -- and I repeat, it was not -- a natural occurring earthquake,\" said the government's top mine safety official, Richard E. Stickler. Stickler, the acting assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health, said, \"pillars failed under excessive load and ejected coal very violently.\" Stickler also said the mine's operator \"was taking more coal than allowed from the barrier pillars and the floor.\" \"This dangerously weakened the strength of the roof support,\" Stickler said. In addition to the six miners killed in the initial cave-in August 6 in northwest Emery County, three would-be rescuers died 10 days later in a subsequent collapse. The bodies of the six miners killed in the initial collapse were never recovered. Richard Gates, the lead investigator for the government, said the pillars in the mine \"simply were not large enough to support the load.\" That resulted in a \"catastrophic failure of pillars over a broad area,\" as large as half a mile, he said. University of Utah scientists said in June that the collapse was not the result of an earthquake. \"As seismologists, we're as certain as we can be that the seismic event registered as a magnitude-3.9 shock was due to the collapse of the mine and not a naturally occurring earthquake,\" said Walter Arabasz, director of the university's Utah Seismograph Stations, in a written statement. Earlier this year, a Labor Department report criticized Mine Safety and Health Administration officials for approving plans for a risky mining technique, known as retreat mining, that was in use before the collapse. In the process, miners remove pillars of coal that support the roof of a chamber one by one, allowing the roof to collapse behind them. Mine owner Bob Murray repeatedly denied in the days after the disaster that his company practiced retreat mining at Crandall Canyon. He later admitted that the practice had been used at the mine but said it was not being done at the time of the disaster.", "a98f1a0258f641788e570264b79e5c816f80054f": "(CNN) -- Italian newspapers, an archbishop and civil liberties campaigners expressed shock and revulsion on Monday after photographs were published of sunbathers apparently enjoying a day at the beach just meters from where the bodies of two drowned Roma girls were laid out on the sand. Photographs of the dead Roma girls on a beach caused outrage in Italy. Italian news agency ANSA reported that the incident had occurred on Saturday at the beach of Torregaveta, west of Naples, southern Italy, where the two girls had earlier been swimming in the sea with two other Roma girls. Reports said they had gone to the beach to beg and sell trinkets. Local news reports said the four girls found themselves in trouble amid fierce waves and strong currents. Emergency services responded 10 minutes after a distress call was made from the beach and two lifeguards attended the girls upon hearing their screams. Two of them were pulled to safety but rescuers failed to reach the other two in time to save them.  Watch why the photos have generated anger \u00bb . The Web site of the Archbishop of Naples said the girls were cousins named Violetta and Cristina, aged 12 and 13. Their bodies were eventually laid out on the sand under beach towels to await collection by police. Photographs show sunbathers in bikinis and swimming trunks sitting close to where the girls' feet can be seen poking out from under the towels concealing their bodies. A photographer who took photos at the scene told CNN the mood among sunbathers had been one of indifference. Other photos show police officers lifting the bodies into coffins and carrying them away past bathers reclined on sun loungers. \"While the lifeless bodies of the girls were still on the sand, there were those who carried on sunbathing or having lunch just a few meters away,\" Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported. Corriere della Sera said that a crowd of curious onlookers that had formed around the bodies quickly dispersed. \"Few left the beach or abandoned their sunbathing. When the police from the mortuary arrived an hour later with coffins, the two girls were carried away between bathers stretched out in the sun.\" The incident also attracted condemnation from the Archbishop of Naples, Cardinal Crecenzio Seppe. \"Indifference is not an emotion for human beings,\" Seppe wrote in his parish blog. \"To turn the other way or to mind your own business can sometimes be more devastating than the events that occur.\" Recent weeks have seen heightened tensions between Italian authorities and the country's Roma minority amid a crackdown by Silvo Berlusconi's government targeting illegal immigrants and talk by government officials of a \"Roma emergency\" that has seen the 150,000-strong migrant group blamed for rising street crime. That has provided justification for police raids on Roma camps and controversial government plans to fingerprint all Roma -- an act condemned by the European Parliament and United Nations officials as a clear act of racial discrimination. Popular resentment against Romanies has also seen Roma camps near Naples attacked and set on fire with petrol bombs by local residents. In a statement published on its Web site, the Italian civil liberties group EveryOne said Saturday's drowning had occurred in an atmosphere of \"racism and horror\" and cast doubt on the reported version of events, suggesting that it appeared unusual for the four girls to wade into the sea, apparently casting modesty aside and despite being unable to swim. \"The most shocking aspect of all this is the attitude of the people on the beach,\" the statement said. \"No one appears the slightest upset at the sight and presence of the children's dead bodies on the beach: they carry on swimming, sunbathing, sipping soft drinks and chatting.\" CNN's Jennifer Eccleston contributed to this report.", "d69d50059c96bd729e9e4c54eee7901d43c0181d": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Congress voted to halt planned cuts in Medicare payments to doctors Tuesday, overriding President Bush's veto in a battle that pitted health insurers against physicians. President Bush says he objects to the bill because it takes choices \"away from seniors to pay physicians.\" The new law stops a 10.6 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors, part of a scheduled cost-saving formula that went into effect July 1. The money for the doctors will be taken from the government-subsidized Medicare Advantage program, which the Bush administration strongly supports. Bush spiked the bill Tuesday, telling lawmakers they would be \"taking choices away from seniors to pay physicians.\" \"I urge the Congress to send me a bill that reduces the growth in Medicare spending, increases competition and efficiency, implements principles of value-driven health care and appropriately offsets increases in physician spending,\" he said in his veto message. The Senate voted 70-26 to enact the law over Bush's objections, the third time in his presidency that Congress has overridden his veto. The margin in the House of Representatives was a lopsided 383-41, well beyond the two-thirds majority needed. The American Medical Association lobbied heavily for the bill, warning that its members could be forced to curtail seeing Medicare patients if the cuts went into effect. But insurers, which receive government subsidies to offer Medicare Advantage plans, warned that 2 million seniors could lose health benefits if it passed. A total of 21 Senate Republicans joined 47 Democrats and two independents in the override vote. Supporters broke a GOP-led filibuster of the bill last week, aided by the dramatic return of Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. Kennedy's vote came in his first appearance on the Senate floor since surgery to remove a brain tumor in early June. Though he did not vote Tuesday, Kennedy praised his colleagues for overriding the \"misguided\" veto. \"It's a great vote, and a great day for America's seniors,\" he said in a written statement. Those Republicans who opposed the bill argued that it would roll back many of the changes made to Medicare in 2003, when Congress created privately run, government-subsidized prescription drug coverage and expanded the role of private insurers in other coverage. \"These are not pro-patient policies,\" said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona. \"Rather, the bill reduces access, benefits and choices for Medicare beneficiaries.\" But critics of the 2003 reforms say Medicare Advantage subsidies end up costing more than the government would pay to cover the same people through regular Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will reduce federal spending by $12.5 billion by 2013, largely by reducing Medicare Advantage enrollment. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said the bill also made \"vital improvements\" by supporting rural health care and lowering fees for mental health care. \"Today, we can stand up for Medicare,\" she said. \"We did it last week, when we came together and voted for this measure by a veto-proof margin, and I believe we can do it today by overriding that veto.\" Congress had passed only two bills over Bush's objections: a $23 billion water-project legislation that the president vetoed in 2007 and a $300 billion farm bill he spiked in May. The Medicare system pays for the health care of roughly 40 million elderly Americans. Rising health care costs have made Medicare a growing part of the federal budget, and the stress on the system is increasing as more baby boomers reach retirement age. While the debate was raging over the bill, the AMA said the cuts could lead to a \"meltdown\" of the government's health care system for the elderly. A recent survey by the group found that 60 percent of physicians will be forced to limit the number of new Medicare patients they can take on if the cuts go into effect. \"We stand at the brink of a Medicare meltdown. ... For doctors, this is not a partisan issue; it's a patient access issue,\" AMA President Nancy Nielsen said in a statement after last week's Senate vote. The AMA ran radio and TV ads over the July Fourth congressional recess targeting 10 Republican senators, seven of whom are up for re-election. The AARP, the nation's largest organization of retired people, and other groups also are weighing in against the cuts.

A convicted Iranian drug dealer is hanged from a crane in the southern city of Shiraz in September. The 30 had their cases tried by the highest judicial authorities and were found guilty of the charges brought against them, Iran's judiciary said in a statement. The verdicts are final, and the sentences will be carried out Sunday, according to Fars. According to Amnesty International, Iran executed 317 people last year, second only to China's 470. The U.S. executed 42 people in 2007, according to Amnesty International. The Iranian judiciary's statement said that all 30 were convicted of crimes including murder, murder in commission of a crime, disturbing public safety and security, being a public nuisance while drunk and being involved in illegal relationships -- relationships between men and women who are not married to each other. Kidnapping and using weapons while committing a crime were among the charges. The statement said that 20 of the people were convicted of drug and alcohol dealing, armed robbery and smuggling arms. The judiciary said it will provide more details later as to the crimes committed by those condemned and added that the hangings should serve as a warning to those who are contemplating committing such crimes. Others are awaiting trial, and their sentences will be carried out as soon as the verdicts are pronounced by the courts, the judiciary said. The judiciary asked the public to notify the authorities if they have any information that might lead to arrest and convictions of criminals. Iran's government launched a campaign March 20 to increase public security and bring the crime rate down. Police cracked down on drug dealers, whom they called criminal gang members, and habitual criminals who use guns in the commission of their crime. Alleged weapons smugglers and people who break social and religious laws, including adulterers, were also targets. National television showed scenes of what were described as criminals being paraded in chains as a deterrent to others. The wave of arrests has subsided, as officials are now prosecuting the suspects and sentencing those convicted.

Democrats say speculation in oil futures is a significant reason why oil prices have risen this year. But Republicans vowed to block the Senate from taking up any other measure until the Democratic leadership agrees to vote on other energy-related issues. Republicans want to offer up to 28 amendments to the bill on a wide range of energy topics, including increasing domestic oil production. The Democrats want to limit them to two amendments. \"This is not some arcane subject; this is the biggest issue in the country,\" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. \"It's on the floor now. We say, let's deal with it. We're not afraid to vote on their amendments, they shouldn't be afraid to vote on ours. Let the Senate work its will on the No. 1 issue in the country.\" The Republicans said they would not prevent the Senate from taking up the housing bill passed earlier in the day by the House, although a final vote on that bill is not expected before the end of the week. Democrats oppose Republican measures to lift bans on offshore drilling and oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve. See how gas prices have risen across the country \u00bb . Republicans say the process would not be fair unless they can offer all of their amendments. Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, accused the Republicans of wanting to score political points rather than pass legislation. \"The problem with our Republican colleagues is that they want to debate, not act. ... Even when they are offered what they want, they say no.\" Menendez suggested there was bipartisan support for measures meant to limit speculation, encourage conservation and provide tax credits for renewable energy. \"Why would you not move forward on the items that you have consensus?\" he asked. The disagreement between Republicans and Democrats could result in Congress leaving Washington for its monthlong recess in August without passing any measures to lower gas prices, which are averaging above $4 a gallon at the pump. Experts have said lifting bans on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and offshore would not affect the oil market for several years, but Republicans have argued that the psychological effect of opening more areas for oil exploration would bring prices down. Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-North Dakota, one of the main sponsors of the bill, pleaded for Republicans to help \"wring excessive speculation\" from the oil markets. He says speculation is responsible for 71 percent of the increase in a price of a barrel of oil this year. Some analysts say speculation has added between $40 to $60 dollars to a barrel of oil. But other experts have questioned the extent to which speculators -- rather than basic market principles of supply and demand -- have driven up the price of oil. Wednesday morning, a barrel of light, sweet crude was priced around $128 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down from the $147 a barrel record set July 11 and the lowest price since June 5. Dorgan said ending speculation in the oil market would be a sensible first step toward lowering gas prices that both sides of the aisle could agree to. Republicans \"have come up with a hundred excuses why they don't want to do that,\" he said. But Republicans say they want the opportunity to offer \"real\" solutions that will lower energy prices, which includes more drilling to expand domestic production.  See what factors are driving up the price of oil \u00bb . \"The Republicans know that American people want us to do something real, something big, something important about the price of gasoline,\" said Sen. Pete Dominici, R-New Mexico. \"And the only thing that we can do that is important is to release large quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are owned by American people and that have been locked up for 27 years in moratoria.\" Dorgan, however, said the Republicans are trying to suggest Democrats are against additional domestic oil production, noting that there are millions of acres of federally controlled land and off-shore drilling sites that are open to exploration but have not been used by oil companies. \"It's a false choice that the minority side says we should drill and that the majority side doesn't,\" Dorgan said. The bill in the Senate would provide more resources and authority to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to detect and punish speculation. It would help stop speculators from using foreign markets to manipulate the price of oil in the United States, require more transparency in oil markets and limit the trading of market players who do not intend to receive the oil they purchase.

Fritzl initially confessed to raping his daughter and having seven children with her. Doctors placed Kerstin Fritzl in an artificial coma in April after she emerged for the first time from the cellar where she was held captive from birth by her father Josef. Kerstin, along with six other children, was born from Josef Fritzl's incestuous relationship with his daughter Elisabeth, now 43, whom he raped repeatedly during the 24 years she was imprisoned beneath his home. Police say Fritzl, 73, has confessed to holding his Elisabeth captive and fathering seven children, six of whom survived. Kerstin was admitted to hospital in Amstetten, west of Vienna, in an unconscious state after Elisabeth persuaded Fritzl that she needed medical attention. Suspicious medics alerted police, who opened an investigation. Detectives began investigating the case after hospital officials started inquiring about the girl's family history.

Iraq fans cheer during an Olympic qualifying soccer match against Australia in November. Jassim M. Jaffer, Iraq's minister of youth and sports, told CNN he is \"optimistic that we will participate.\" Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh and the ministry's adviser, Basil Abdul Mahdi, are on their way to Lausanne, Switzerland, to meet with IOC officials, Jaffer said. The IOC barred Iraq from participating in the Olympic Summer Games in Beijing, China, citing what it said was government interference with Iraq's Olympic movement. The IOC's charter does not allow political interference. The ban stems from the Iraqi government decision in May to suspend the country's existing Olympic committee and form a new entity.  Watch an official explain the decision \u00bb . But even as government representatives traveled to Switzerland, Jaffer said Iraq was considering legal action against the IOC. \"We will revert to international courts with a complaint against the IOC ... to get Iraq's rights and the rights of the athletes,\" Jaffer said. On Friday, another Iraqi government official said the country was doing what it could to reverse the ban, but acknowledged that \"chances are slim\" for a change. Basam Ridha al-Husseini, an adviser to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, told CNN the government has been in \"heavy negotiations\" with IOC officials through the Asian Olympic Committee. \"The Iraqi government will not give up on our participation, which is still needed by our people,\" he said in a phone interview from Dubai. \"We are doing our best to stop the ban. ... The chances of that are slim, but we will persevere and hope it will happen.\" Repeated attempts by CNN to reach the IOC press office in Switzerland for comment were unsuccessful. But on Thursday, IOC spokeswoman Emmanuelle Moreau said the IOC in June suspended Iraq's national Olympic committee after the government removed elected officials and put in people not recognized by the IOC. She said the IOC had proposed to the Iraqi government that officials come to the IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, \"to discuss possible solutions.\" \"We're extremely disappointed with the situation,\" Moreau said. \"The athletes have been ill-served by the government in Iraq.\" Iraq missed a Wednesday deadline for the entry of athletes to compete in archery, judo, rowing and weightlifting, Moreau said. She said there is a chance that track and field athletes could compete if the original committee is reinstated. The deadline for the track team to register is at the end of the month. Jaffer, Iraq's sports minister, told CNN on Friday that the IOC's decision was \"unjust\" because it did not take into consideration the Iraqi government's reasons for the May suspension. The minister called on the IOC to come to Iraq and talk to the sports federation to investigate the political interference accusations, and then act accordingly. \"Looking at this from far away, without going into the details, not reading the Iraqi government's reports, not hearing Iraq's side of the story and accusing Iraq of many things is really unfortunate,\" he said. Several Iraqi athletes were to travel to China for the games' start in August. Iraqi sprinter Dana Hussain cried for hours after hearing the news of the ban on Thursday, which arrived in the form of a letter to Iraqi officials. \"She hasn't stopped. It's like finding out that a close relative has died,\" said her coach, Yousif Abdul Rahman. Abdul Rahman attempted to console Hussain by assuring her that she could compete in the 2012 Olympics.  Watch Hussain react to the news \u00bb . \"In this horrible situation,\" she said, \"who can say I'll even be alive in 2012?\" Al-Husseini said Iraq had the right as a sovereign nation to suspend the Olympic committee, which he accused of documented corruption. It was not clear where the committee's funds were going and they \"could be ending up in the hands of terrorists,\" he said. \"We are satisfied with the decision ... stand by it and we are not going to change an order by [Prime Minister] al-Maliki and the Cabinet. ... Never,\" he said. He was asked whether Iraq would consider doing what Yugoslavia did in the 1992 Winter Olympics when it was banned -- sending individual athletes and not raising the national flag. Al-Husseini said that would be an option, but al-Maliki rejected it. Al-Husseini said that Iraq had been banned from taking part in the 1990 Olympics during the Saddam Hussein-era because of the invasion of Kuwait. The 1990 ban, enacted by the Olympic Council of Asia, actually was a ban on participation in the Asian Games, a regional Olympics-related event.

The girls were stopped by customs officials at Accra trying to smuggle drugs back to Britain. Ghanaian police arrested the teenagers, identified as Yasemin Vatansever and Yatunde Diya, in July 2007 as they prepared to board a British Airways flight to London. When officials searched their laptop bags as part of departure formalities, they found about 13 lbs (6 kg) of cocaine. The girls, now 17, were 16 at the time of their arrest. They faced a maximum sentence of three years. UK media have named the girls as Yatunde Diya and Yasemin Vatansever of north London. In January, a juvenile court in Ghana sentenced the pair to nine months in jail for trying to smuggle cocaine out of the country. At the time, a British Foreign Office spokesman said the teens would not have to serve the full sentence because they had already spent more than six months in custody. But soon afterward, Ghanaian authorities changed their minds. The girls were housed in a correctional home for girls in the country's capital, Accra. Fair Trials International, a UK-based group that provided legal assistance to the pair, called the girls \"pawns in a larger operation.\" Authorities in Ghana had said a man paid the girls \u00a36,000 (about $11,700) to fly to Ghana to retrieve the laptop bags containing the drugs from two of his associates, according to the country's national news agency.

Cambodian soldiers stand guard near Preah Vihear temple, close to the Thai border. The country is not asking for U.N. intervention, said Information Minister Kheu Kanharith. Rather, the letter that Cambodia's permanent mission in New York submitted to the chairmen of the Security Council and the General Assembly is meant to draw attention to a crisis that entered its sixth day Sunday. The two countries agreed to meet Monday to defuse tensions -- even as each side continued to amass more troops to the site of the Preah Vihear temple. Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the 11th century temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. The International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962. Thailand claims, however, that the 1.8 square mile (4.6 sq. km) area around it was never fully demarcated. Thailand further says that the dispute arose from the fact that the Cambodian government used a map drawn during the French occupation of Cambodia that places both the temple and the surrounding area in that country's territory. Earlier this month, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- places the U.N. says have outstanding universal value. The decision re-ignited tensions, with some in Thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple. Opposition parties in Thailand used the issue to attack the government, which initially backed the heritage listing. A Thai court overturned the pact, prompting the resignation of Thailand's foreign minister, Noppadon Pattama. He had endorsed the application. Cambodia, meanwhile, is preparing for general elections on July 27. And Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has been in power since the mid-1980s, has portrayed the U.N. recognition as a national triumph. The current flare-up began Tuesday, when Cambodian guards briefly detained three Thais who crossed into the area. Once they were let go, the three refused to leave the territory. Cambodia claims Thailand sent troops to retrieve the trio and gradually built up their numbers. Thailand denies the charge, saying its troops are deployed in Thai territory. Each side has asked its troops to withhold fire unless they are fired upon. So far, the only casualty has been a Thai soldier who was injured Tuesday by a landmine -- possibly left over from the time the Khmer Rouge occupied the area. The Khmer Rouge, a radical communist movement that ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, won power through a guerrilla war.

James Baker, left, and Warren Christopher led a panel that recommended a new War Powers Act. The current War Powers Resolution is \"ineffective, and it should be repealed and it should be replaced,\" James Baker said in a joint appearance with Warren Christopher, announcing the results of the study they led. The recommendation follows failed efforts by Democrats in Congress to put a stop to the war in Iraq or to put conditions on President Bush's conduct of it. Congress passed a joint resolution to authorize armed force against Iraq in 2002, but some Bush opponents say it should not have been interpreted as a blank check for the United States to invade and occupy the Persian Gulf nation. Baker, who served in George H.W. Bush's administration, and Christopher, who served under President Bill Clinton, said their project was not prompted by any specific war, with Christopher adding that the commission had \"tried very hard not to call balls and strikes on past history here.\" \"We didn't direct this report at any particular conflict,\" Baker added. The existing law, the War Powers Resolution of 1973, has been regarded as unconstitutional by every president since it was passed as a response to the Vietnam War, Baker and Christopher said. It requires presidents to report regularly to Congress about ongoing conflicts, but the provision has been flouted. \"No president has ever made a submission to Congress pursuant to the War Powers Resolution since 1973,\" former Sen. Slade Gorton, a Republican member of the committee, said Tuesday. The panel, formally called the National War Powers Commission, said a new law should be created requiring the president to consult with key members of Congress before sending troops into combat expected to last more than a week, or within three days of doing so in the case of operations that need to be kept secret. It should also make clear exactly who the president needed to consult. The panel suggests that the president talk to \"a joint Congressional committee made up of the leaders of the House and the Senate as well as the chairmen and ranking members of key committees.\" The new committee would have a permanent professional staff with access to intelligence information, Baker and Christopher said. Congress, in turn, would have to declare war or vote on a \"resolution of approval\" within 30 days, they said. If a resolution of approval failed, any member of Congress could introduce a \"resolution of disapproval,\" but it was not clear that such an act would stop a war in progress. Christopher was unable to say in the news conference what practical effect congressional disapproval would have. Baker said the commission had been in touch with the presidential campaigns of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain, as well as leaders of Congress. He declined to reveal what they thought of the proposal, but said: \"We haven't gotten a negative reaction.\" Congress has not officially declared war since 1942, when the United States entered formal hostilities with the Axis powers in World War II. But since then, presidents have sent troops into countries including Korea, Vietnam, Grenada and Iraq. The Constitution makes the president the commander in chief of the armed forces, but gives Congress the power to declare war and approve military budgets.

Al-Shehhi, who previously served as the Emirates' ambassador to India, is to travel to Iraq after his nomination is confirmed. An official government source said the UAE intends to reopen its embassy in Baghdad by the end of the year. The United States and other nations have urged Arab countries to post ambassadors to Iraq, reopen embassies and forge closer relationships with Iraq's government. The UAE mission in Iraq hasn't been active since a UAE diplomat was kidnapped and released two years ago. The year before that, two Iraqis working for that mission were killed. No ambassador from an Arab country has been stationed permanently in Iraq since July 2005, when Egypt's ambassador, Dr. Ihab al-Sherif, was abducted from a Baghdad street and slain. Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the assassination, saying it had killed al-Sherif  because of Egypt's foreign policies and its alliances with the United States and Israel. The UAE's announcement Sunday came a month after its foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, visited Baghdad. During that visit, al-Nahyan extended the official invitation that brought al-Maliki to Dubai. Iraq's government said that al-Nahyan's one-day visit was the first to Iraq by a Gulf Cooperation Council foreign minister since the 2003 U.S-led invasion that toppled the regime of President Saddam Hussein. The Gulf Cooperation Council also includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Prior to al-Nahyan's visit, only Syria and Jordan had sent foreign ministers to Iraq in the post-Saddam Hussein era. The Arab League's secretary-general has also visited. War and the Sunni-Shiite rivalry in Iraq and the Muslim world have slowed the Arab world's re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Iraq. Iraq's mixed population is mostly Arab with some Kurds and Turkmens, and mostly Shiite Muslim, with a Sunni Muslim minority. Most Arab countries -- including the UAE -- are Sunni-ruled. Iraq's government is Shiite-dominated and it is forging a close relationship with its neighbor, the non-Arab Shiite nation of Iran -- a development that concerns Arab nations wary of Iran's Islamic Republic government.

Reports in India's media said four Pakistani soldiers were killed, but Pakistan's military \"strongly denied the report of any (casualties) on the Pakistani side.\" Pakistan's military also denied its forces crossed the Line of Control, saying the skirmish started when Indian soldiers tried to establish a forward post on Pakistan's side of the line. \"On Pakistan's' objection, Indian troops opened indiscriminate and unprovoked fire,\" a Pakistan military news release, posted on Monday, stated. \"The Indian fire was immediately responded to. The firing continued -- intermittently during the whole night.\" Pakistan said the Indian soldiers \"were forced to flee from the area leaving behind their weapons\" after the firefight. Indian and Pakistani forces have exchanged periodic gunfire since May, but Monday's clashes appear to be a serious setback to the ongoing peace process between the two nations. India and Pakistan had announced a bilateral cease-fire all along their borders in November 2003 and the cease-fire had been holding on the borders until recently. Kashmir has been at the root of two wars between India and Pakistan, both of which tested nuclear weapons in 1998. An 18-year separatist campaign in the Indian-controlled portion of the largely Muslim territory has claimed more than 43,000 lives, according to government officials, although human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations put the toll at twice that number. India has long accused Pakistan of supporting the separatists in Kashmir, a charge Pakistan denies. India blamed militants from Pakistan for a suicide car bombing outside its embassy in Afghanistan that killed 58 people on July 7. A December 2001 attack on India's parliament that India blamed on the militants brought the two nations to the brink of another war, but they have expanded economic and cultural ties since the November 2003 cease-fire agreement. -- CNN's Aliza Kassim in Atlanta and Mukhtar Ahmad in Srinagar contributed to this report .", "4ca8b3cf75948dffea7b96e71bf1d9621107354b": "(CNN) -- \"Mad Men\" and \"Damages\" found themselves on top when the nominations for the 60th Annual Primetime Emmys came out Thursday morning -- but, again, there was no love for HBO's \"The Wire.\" Emmy nominee Jon Hamm stars as ad exec Don Draper in \"Mad Men,\" which earned 16 nominations. AMC's \"Mad Men\" and FX's \"Damages\" made Emmy history Thursday as the first basic-cable series to be nominated for best drama. The pair, which had made the 10-series Emmy shortlist, have been widely hailed by critics and have received good ratings for basic-cable series -- though \"Damages\" star Glenn Close said she hopes the Emmys help boost the show's audience. \"We need all the help we can get,\" she told The Associated Press. On the other hand, HBO's \"The Wire\" -- which concluded its fifth and final season this year -- once again came up empty in the best drama nominations. It did receive one nod, for writing. The series, though much praised and dissected by a hard-core group of fans, has received little recognition from the Emmys, with just one previous nomination -- also for writing -- in 2005.  Check out some of the top Emmy nods this year \u00bb . Indeed, HBO has struggled to find a drama to take the place of the much-lauded \"The Sopranos,\" which won best drama last year after a storied run. \"Mad Men,\" which has made AMC into a player, was allegedly turned down by the cable giant, and shows such as the quickly canceled \"John From Cincinnati\" and \"Rome\" haven't had the same impact. On the other hand, \"In Treatment\" received a nomination for Gabriel Byrne's performance as a therapist, and the network's comedies, particularly \"Entourage,\" have performed strongly. Moreover, the network's short-form programming, such as the miniseries \"John Adams\" and the TV movie \"Recount,\" dominated their Emmy categories: \"John Adams\" led all nominees with 23 nominations, and \"Recount,\" about the 2000 presidential election battle, received 11. \"The network has made up for [its lack of drama series success] in other forms,\" Variety TV editor Michael Schneider told CNN. \"It's still the most nominated network and has the most nominated program.\" HBO led all networks with 85 nominations. Among broadcast networks, ABC led with 76 nominations. Among regularly scheduled TV series, \"30 Rock\" earned 17 nominations and \"Mad Men\" received 16. The 17 nominations for \"30 Rock\" were a record number in a single year for a comedy series. Newcomer \"Pushing Daisies,\" the whimsical series on ABC, received 12 nominations. Given that the show only aired nine episodes -- and hasn't been on the air in months due to the writers strike -- its recognition was a surprise, Schneider said. \"It was nice that voters still remembered it,\" he said. Along with \"Damages\" and \"Mad Men,\" nominees for best drama include \"Boston Legal,\" \"Dexter,\" \"House\" and \"Lost.\" Comedy series nominees are \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" \"Entourage,\" \"The Office,\" \"30 Rock\" and \"Two and a Half Men.\" Cable series dominated the dramatic acting nominations, with four of the six actors and three of the five actresses appearing on basic or pay cable. Best actor in a drama nominees are Byrne (\"In Treatment\"), Bryan Cranston (\"Breaking Bad\"), Michael C. Hall (\"Dexter\"), Jon Hamm (\"Mad Men\"), Hugh Laurie (\"House\") and James Spader (\"Boston Legal\"). \"Dexter,\" which originated on Showtime, earned a short run on CBS following the writers strike. The nominees for best actress in a drama are Close (\"Damages\"), Sally Field (\"Brothers and Sisters\"), Mariska Hargitay (\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\"), Holly Hunter (\"Saving Grace\") and Kyra Sedgwick (\"The Closer\"). A number of familiar names were included among nominees for comedies. The nominees for best actor in a comedy are Alec Baldwin (\"30 Rock\"), Steve Carell (\"The Office\"), Lee Pace (\"Pushing Daisies\"), Tony Shalhoub (\"Monk\") and Charlie Sheen (\"Two and a Half Men\"). Only Pace is a newcomer. The nominees for best actress in a comedy are Christina Applegate (\"Samantha Who?\"), America Ferrera (\"Ugly Betty\"), Tina Fey (\"30 Rock\"), Julia Louis-Dreyfus (\"The New Adventures of Old Christine\") and Mary-Louise Parker (\"Weeds\"). Sarah Silverman earned three nominations, all for different programs: one for a guest shot on \"Monk,\" another for contributing to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" and a third for producing her own \"The Sarah Silverman Program.\" Kristin Chenoweth, Neil Patrick Harris and TV academy Chairman John Shaffner announced the nominations Thursday. Chenoweth was particularly bubbly, throwing in a non sequitur about once dating \"Survivor\" host Jeff Probst and declining to sing \"Happy Birthday\" because \"the Emmys can't afford me to sing that song\" due to licensing arrangements. Both Chenoweth (\"Pushing Daisies\") and Harris (\"How I Met Your Mother\") were nominated in supporting actor categories. Two highly rated shows, \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Desperate Housewives,\" were snubbed. \"Grey's,\" a regular nominee for best drama, was left off that list, though star Sandra Oh was nominated for best supporting actress. \"Housewives,\" which won six Emmys its debut season, was ignored in both best comedy series and best actress in a comedy series categories. Two guest stars did receive nominations. Stephen Colbert, nominated for individual performance in a variety or musical program, put everything in perspective. \"What an honor, unless I don't win,\" he told the AP.

Parents of wounded Virginia Tech students comfort each other on Tuesday. The 24 victims included in the settlement were among the 32 killed by Seung-Hui Cho's April 16, 2007, shooting rampage. The settlement also compensates 18 people injured. \"The commonwealth has endeavored to meet the needs and concerns of the victims, including family members, through both monetary and non-monetary provisions,\" said Chief Deputy Attorney General William C. Mims. Of the remaining eight deceased victims, families of two chose not to file claims and two other claims are unresolved. The other four will be brought forward at a later date, Mims said. The settlement also includes provisions that allow the families to occasionally meet with the governor and Virginia Tech officials to review legislation and improvements made at the campus in response to the tragedy. The families had pursued wrongful death and personal injury claims against the state after an August 2007 report by an independent panel concluded that more timely and more specific information from university officials might have saved lives. University officials were criticized for not immediately warning students and staff after two students were found dead in a dormitory at 7 a.m. on the day of the killings. Police said they initially believed the two had been involved in a romantic dispute, but later determined they were Cho's first victims. It was almost 9:30 a.m. before authorities sent an e-mail to students and staff notifying them of the shootings and warning them to be cautious. About 9:50 a.m., Cho, 23, began shooting people in Norris Hall, an engineering and classroom building. While criticizing the university response, the panel -- which included former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge -- also said quicker action by school officials may not have made a difference. The report also noted that campus and state agencies might have taken a different approach to Cho had his middle- and high-school records followed him to Virginia Tech. Problems with Cho reportedly began to surface well before the shootings. The records detailed his mental health issues, including a tendency to react to depression with violence.", "fb0003754a764d7f3252120de58b515d1f882556": "(CNN) -- Authorities are searching for a female soldier, missing after a fire at her apartment near Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Fayetteville, North Carolina, police released this undated photo of 2nd Lt. Holley Wimunc. Investigators Thursday morning found evidence of arson at the Fayetteville apartment of 2nd Lt. Holley Wimunc, 24. A neighbor, Roland Petty, told CNN affiliate WRAL-TV that he saw a man running from the area on Wednesday night and smelled smoke, although he didn't associate it with the building at the time. In a court filing for a protective order, Wimunc said that in May her husband had knocked her down, held a loaded gun to her head and then threatened to commit suicide, WRAL reported.  Watch police at work at Wimunc's complex \u00bb . The court documents indicate that John Wimunc is a Marine stationed at Camp Lejeune, the station reported. A Camp Lejeune spokesman told WRAL that police had spoken to John Wimunc on Thursday about his wife's disappearance. \"I haven't seen any violence. I know [Wimunc's husband] was not living here anymore, but that's all I know,\" a neighbor told WTVD-TV, another CNN affiliate. Both stations reported that Holley Wimunc's car was still in the parking lot at the apartment. Her disappearance is considered a missing person case. Holley Wimunc's family, from Dubuque, Iowa, released a statement Friday saying they are \"still trying to absorb the impact of this week's stunning events.\" \"First and foremost, our concern is for our daughter, Holley -- that she will be found and restored to us,\" the James family wrote. \"When you read about or watch television news reports of incidents like this, you can hardly believe that it could happen to you. But it has -- we are so grateful for the thoughts, support and prayers of friends today -- something we're leaning on heavily right now.\" The family said they would not be making any further comments, citing the investigation. No one was inside the apartment at the time of the fire, police said. Wimunc is assigned to Charlie Company, Womack Army Hospital at Fort Bragg, police said. A statement from Fort Bragg said Wimunc is a nurse from Lafayette, Louisiana, who works at the hospital's mother and baby ward. \"Womack Army Medical Center staff is very concerned about our soldier and her safety,\" Col. Terry Walters, commander of WAMC, said in the statement. \"The staff and members of her unit are being supported by the command and with counseling available through our unit chaplains.\" The blaze comes nearly three weeks after the body of a pregnant soldier was found in a hotel near Fort Bragg.

Iraqis watch as a statue of Saddam Hussein is toppled in Baghdad in 2003. Failures to recognize the chaos engulfing the country and to send in enough troops to restore order after the 2003 invasion have long been highlighted by critics, but a new report shows the Army assessing itself. Frank opinions from officers serving in the 18 months from the start of war to Iraqi elections in January 2005 reveal there were concerns at the time, not just about assumptions made by planners but at decisions taken once U.S.-led coalition forces had control of Iraq. \"I flipped,\" Gen. Jack Keane, then the Army's deputy chief of staff, told the historians of his reaction to a June 2003 decision to transfer control of all coalition troops away from the land forces command that had been preparing for the mission. He recounted a conversation with Gen. John Abizaid, who succeeded the invasion's architect, Gen. Tommy Franks. \"I said, 'Jesus Christ, John, this is a recipe for disaster. We invested in that headquarters. We have the experience and judgment in that headquarters.\" Keane said it took the U.S. command between six and eight months to get the new headquarters up and running. During that time, troops in the field saw the mood of ordinary Iraqis turn against Americans and watched the insurgency take root. \"By the time we got a plan together to resource everything, the insurgents had closed that window of opportunity quickly,\" Col. David Perkins, a brigade commander in the Army's 3rd Infantry Division, told the historians. \"What we started doing in September was probably a good idea to have done in April 2003.\" Franks, who would soon retire and be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, said he ordered the transition to force the Pentagon to get leaders into the field to work with civilian occupation officials. \"That is a task that John Abizaid and I very simply laid on Washington and said, 'Figure it out. Do it fast. Get me a joint headquarters in here. We have a lot of work to do and [civilian administrator of Iraq] Jerry Bremer has a lot of responsibility and he needs help,' \" he recalled. The 720-page report compiled by the Combat Studies Institute at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, details the effects of having too few coalition troops on the ground when the reality after the fall of Baghdad was \"severely out of line\" with the anticipated conditions. Previous experience \"should have indicated that many more troops would be needed for the post-Saddam era in Iraq,\" historians wrote in the report, \"On Point II: Transition to a New Campaign.\" \"The coalition's inability to prevent looting, to secure Iraq's borders and to guard the vast number of munitions dumps in the early months after Saddam's overthrow are indicative of the shortage,\" the study found. About 150,000 U.S. and allied troops were in Iraq after the invasion, at a time when war planners were assuming that Iraq's government would remain functional after Hussein's ouster and that there would be no mass insurgency. \"These factors were in line with prewar planning for a quick turnover of power to Iraqis and a quick withdrawal of U.S. forces, leaving Iraqis to determine their own political future -- options that proved impossible to execute,\" the historians wrote in the report released over the weekend. \"We had the wrong assumptions, and therefore, we had the wrong plan to put into play,\" Gen. William Wallace, who commanded the Army's V Corps during the invasion, told the authors. But some of the most critical decisions were made between May and August 2003, which some participants called a \"window of opportunity that could have been exploited to produce the conditions for the quick creation of a new Iraq.\" Among those decisions were the frequently criticized dissolution of the Iraqi army and the order that barred former members of Hussein's Baath Party from public life as well as the change in plan over the joint headquarters.", "fb8431bc320c2c1a6c32699da0fdae228ed8d73b": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The inspector-general of the House of Representatives will investigate recent allegations of sexual misconduct among congressional pages, the Democratic and Republican leaders of the chamber announced.

Ginny Brown-Waite, R-Florida, last week. \"It did go beyond that. There were not only a young male and female involved, but there were also observers and other page participants who were, let's say, enablers.\" To protest what they called lax oversight, Brown-Waite has resigned from the House Page Board, along with Republican Rep. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia.  Watch more on alleged page misconduct \u00bb . Brown-Waite said her resignation was meant \"to send a loud and clear message\" to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders. Pelosi, a California Democrat, and Republican Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio issued a joint statement on the matter Wednesday. \"We expect the inspector-general to gather the facts and recommend the appropriate and necessary corrective actions to be taken by the House,\" it said. In 2006, Florida GOP Rep. Mark Foley was forced to resign after his sexually suggestive e-mails to male pages were made public. The House Ethics Committee later found that some people who knew about Foley's questionable communications chose to \"remain willfully ignorant\" rather than confront the matter. Then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Illinois, promised an overhaul of the program, which Pelosi pledged to pursue after Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in the 2006 elections. \"Apparently Democrats didn't learn from the Mark Foley incident that pages need better supervision,\" Brown-Waite said. \"Apparently they haven't learned anything.\" No members of Congress are involved in the current controversy, and House Clerk Lorraine Miller, who administers the programs, said the students involved were dismissed.

Sgt. Edgar Patino faces first-degree murder charges in the slaying of Megan Touma. Army Sgt. Edgar Patino is linked to two anonymous \"confession\" letters sent in what police believe was an attempt to derail the investigation into Megan Touma's death, police said. Patino, 27, was arrested at his Hope Mills, North Carolina, home Tuesday night without incident. Patino, who is stationed at Fort Bragg's JFK Special Warfare Training Center, faces first-degree murder charges in the slaying of Touma, 23, who was seven months pregnant. Touma's decomposing body was found in the bathtub of a hotel room near Fort Bragg on June 21. Authorities said Wednesday that they believe she died late June 13 or early June 14. Although her death has been ruled a homicide, authorities said Wednesday that the state medical examiner has not made a final determination of how she died.  Watch officials discuss the case \u00bb . Patino has admitted being in Touma's hotel room June 13, and investigators found that the room's electronic key card was last used on that day, police said Wednesday. However, Patino has not admitted killing Touma. Patino wore red jail coveralls in his initial court appearance Wednesday afternoon. He spoke only to answer the judge's questions, acknowledging that he understood he was charged with first-degree murder and that the charge carries a maximum penalty of death or life in prison without parole. He also requested that an attorney be appointed for him. Fayetteville, North Carolina, police Chief Tom Bergamine said Wednesday that Patino, who is married, was the father of Touma's fetus. Police also said evidence links Patino to a letter received June 25 by the Fayetteville Observer newspaper. In it, the writer claimed to have killed Touma and said more killings were planned. The letter was signed with a circular symbol similar to one used by the Zodiac killer in California in the late 1960s. At the request of police, the newspaper withheld information regarding the letters and delayed publishing a story for several days to allow police to conduct an investigation, Bergamine said. Police also received a similar letter. Fayetteville police Sgt. Chris Corcione said both letters were postmarked June 24 and sent from Fayetteville. Patino purchased a typewriter the day before the letters were sent, Corcione said. That typewriter is now in police custody. Police, however, stopped short of saying Patino wrote the letters, saying only that evidence links him to them. Two of Touma's friends, who are also female soldiers and asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the case, said Touma and Patino had been stationed together in Germany and had dated. They said Patino had proposed to Touma in Germany, but when the two returned to North Carolina, she discovered that he was married. Police said Wednesday that Patino was a person of interest from the early days of their investigation. Corcione said his initial interview with authorities could be described as \"deceptive,\" and officials had little other contact with him until his arrest. Police have found no criminal record for him. \"We felt like from the beginning, there was no major concerns of a serial killer being out there,\" Bergamine said. Patino was being held without bail at the Cumberland County Detention Center, Bergamine said. Asked what police believe the motive to be, Fayetteville police Detective Joshua Carter said, \"Right now, the motive is going to be held close. There's still several months of investigation left to be conducted.\" \"I think one of the things that folks need to understand is that scientific evidence, things that have to go to the lab, they're going to take time,\" Bergamine said. \"This is not the world of television and 'CSI.' Things don't get settled within a hour.\" Touma, a five-year Army veteran, had served with the U.S. Army Dental Activity Clinic in Bamberg, Germany, and in Fort Drum, New York, before her stint at Fort Bragg. She is the second female soldier from Fort Bragg to die under suspicious circumstances since June. Army 2nd Lt. Holley Wimunc was killed in early July. Her Fayetteville apartment was torched July 10, and her charred body was found nearby a few days later. Her husband, Marine Cpl. John Wimunc, was charged with arson and first-degree murder in connection with the death. Another Marine, Lance Cpl. Kyle Alden, was charged with arson and felony accessory after the fact to first-degree murder. Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, also had a homicide case involving a female service member this year. The charred body of Marine Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach, 20, was found in the backyard of another Marine stationed at the base, Cpl. Cesar Laurean. Lauterbach was eight months pregnant when she died. Laurean, who has been charged with first-degree murder, was arrested in Mexico in April, but because he holds citizenship in the United States and Mexico, he cannot be immediately deported and must go through an extradition process. Authorities have said that if he chooses to fight extradition, it could take two years to return him to North Carolina.

The Canadian frigate HMCS Ville de Quebec will escort ships carrying food aid to Somalia. \"Canada is stepping up to the plate by tasking Ville de Quebec with the role of escorting World Food Programme ships to ensure their safe arrival at designated ports,\" Canadian Defense Minister Peter MacKay said in a government news release. The United Nations hunger program praised Canada for answering its call for help, and said it hoped other governments would step forward to take over from Canada once it completes its mission in a few weeks. The HMCS Ville de Quebec is a 440-foot frigate armed with torpedoes, surface-to-air missiles and other weapons, and carries a twin-engine Sea King anti-submarine helicopter. Ville de Quebec, which can travel at speeds greater than 27 knots, will be dispatched after Somalia's transitional government formally authorizes the mission, the government's news release said. WFP asked the world's naval powers in mid-June to help its ships reach the more than 2 million people in need of aid. It put out the request weeks before French, Danish and Dutch warships ended their escort missions, which began in November. Pirate attacks on unescorted ships have been a growing problem in Somalia. Three European freighters were hijacked off the Horn of Africa in June, adding to the 27 other reported attacks this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which tracks piracy. WFP delivers 80 percent of its aid to Somalia by sea, and WFP spokesman Peter Smerdon said that if there are no warships to escort the food supply, the program will have to rely on ground or air travel to deliver the food. But both are dangerous and expensive. The agency said that if there is no assistance from naval powers, piracy will increase, and so will death and malnutrition. Smerdon said that although Somalia's food crisis hasn't yet reached the devastation of the early 1990s, \"We're worried it will be.\"", "1b1479bb6e290e86e4b2a1e862e06909a0a62f8e": "SHERMAN, Texas (CNN) -- A seventeenth person has died from injuries suffered in Friday's bus crash in northern Texas, a hospital spokeswoman said Sunday. The damaged bus is hauled from the crash scene on a flatbed truck Friday in Sherman, Texas. The driver of the bus, which was carrying dozens of Vietnamese people on a church trip, apparently lost control on northbound U.S. 75 early Friday. The bus smashed into a guardrail before rolling on its side and sliding into a gully. The accident happened near the Texas-Oklahoma state line. Twelve people were declared dead at the scene, and four others died at hospitals, officials said. Police estimated that, in addition to the deaths, 33 to 39 of the 54 passengers and the driver suffered mild to serious injuries.  Watch what investigators are learning about the accident \u00bb . The bus was operating illegally, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. The National Transportation Safety Board has begun investigating the crash. On Friday, NTSB member Debbie Hersman told reporters that the right front tire of the bus had been retreaded, in violation of safety rules. The blown tire was the only one that was recapped, and it was the only one whose tread separated, she said. Asked what caused the Goodyear tire to lose its air, she said, \"we don't know the answer to that question; that's why we're here.\" The bus itself was made in 2002 by Motor Coach Industries. The trip to Carthage, Missouri, had been scheduled by the Vietnamese Catholic Martyrs Church in Houston, though some of the passengers may have belonged to other churches, Hersman said. The 52-year-old driver had his commercial driver's license, but his medical certificate had expired, she said. Late Friday, police were assisting NTSB investigators with gathering evidence and mapping the scene, documenting the location of witness marks and scars on the highway and bridge rail over an overpass, she said. Preliminary evidence suggests that the bus hit a rail on the right side of the bridge and then traveled 1,809 feet before coming to a stop on its right side in the earthen median between the highway and a frontage road, Hersman said. \"As it dropped off the bridge rail, the bus rolled to the right ... where it came to rest.\"  Watch as the fire chief describes the crash scene \u00bb . She noted that the bus was not equipped with seat belts, which are not required on motor coaches. In a written statement, motor carrier agency Administrator John H. Hill said investigators noted \"certain irregularities ... about whether the bus was operating under the name Angel Tours or Iguala Busmex. It is important to note that neither of these domestic entities is authorized to operate as a U.S. passenger carrier in interstate commerce at this time.\" He added that the agency identified Angel Tours \"as being a high-risk carrier due to safety violations detected during roadside safety inspections and was subjected to an FMCSA compliance review in May 2008.\" \"This review resulted in FMCSA placing Angel Tours' operations out of service,\" Hill said. \"To date, Angel Tours has not provided the agency with evidence of satisfactory corrective actions to the problems discovered and remains out of service.\" In addition, \"FMCSA has not granted Iguala Busmex authority to transport passengers because it has failed to fully comply with federal safety requirements.\" He said police have been asked to stop any of the companies' buses. Both companies are owned by Angel de la Torre. A man who answered the phone at Angel Tours office said the owner was meeting with his lawyers and was unavailable. Massage therapist Leha Nguyen, 45, was a passenger. She was traveling by herself on the bus when she departed Houston at 8:30 p.m. Thursday for what was to have been her fourth trip to Carthage, Missouri. After sandwiches were passed around, the group said prayers, and Nguyen began to drift off to sleep in her window seat next to an older woman, four rows behind the driver, she said. iReport.com: Were you there? Send photos, video . About 11:45 p.m., the bus passed Dallas, \"and as soon as we passed Dallas we were on the two-way freeway and I feel the bus ride a little bit fast and I have a feeling, not a safe feeling,\" she said. She added, \"I feel a little bit shaky, but I just let myself at peace and then go to sleep.\" Her sleep didn't last long. \"As I opened my eyes, I see the chair falling off and I was sitting right below the TV and I felt that somebody was laying on my leg and then right next to me there was a lady, she got her arm really crushed up and on top of her there was another lady, she cannot move.\" Although her head hurt, Nguyen -- who left Vietnam in 1975 as a refugee -- was in better shape than many of her fellow riders. She accepted an ambulance ride to the hospital, where she learned that her seatmate had died. Once her scalp was sewn up, she aided in translating for other Vietnamese patients whose English was not as good.

It sometimes seems as if the average Hollywood star is motivated mainly by the promise of a fat pay check. Connie Nielsen shot to fame playing Lucilla in \"Gladiator.\" Or perhaps they're drawn to the celebrity lifestyle. Maybe they crave the love of an adoring public, or perhaps they see the movies as a way to leave their mark on the world, to be immortalized on celluloid. For Danish actress Connie Nielsen it was something quite different. For her, being an actor means being an outsider. \"As an artist you actually do have to make a choice to be an outsider. If you're an outsider you have the freedom to say what people on the inside don't dare to say,\" she told CNN. So Connie Nielsen is not your typical movie star. As a 5-foot-10-inch blonde Scandinavian beauty she has the looks of a classic silver screen siren, but she has steadfastly resisted a career as Hollywood eye candy and rejected the lifestyle that goes with it. \"I absolutely refuse the fame part of my business,\" she says. \"I refuse even the money side of my business. I try to do as good work as I can do, I try to grow in my art and reach for truth,\" she says. Raised in Elling, a small coastal village in Denmark, she is fluent in seven languages and studied acting in France and Italy, making her screen debut in French comedy \"Par O\u00f9 T'es Rentr\u00e9? On T'a Pas Vu Sortir\" (U.S. title \"How Did You Get In? We Didn't See You Leave\") in 1984. She appeared in more French and Italian movies before landing a role opposite Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves in \"The Devil's Advocate\" in 1997. But it wasn't until 2000, when she was cast in Ridley Scott's Oscar-winning \"Gladiator\", that Nielsen landed a role that really let her show her acting ability. As Lucilla, the sister of the villainous Emperor Commodus, Nielsen brought some much-needed subtlety to the swords-and-sandals epic and held her own sharing the screen with Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe. The movie made Nielsen an international star and she scored other successes with \"One Hour Photo\" in 2002, and \"The Hunted\" in 2003. But while the success of \"Gladiator\" opened doors for her, it also meant she had to fight the kind of typecasting that would try to limit her to playing \"the love interest\" to a male lead who got all the good lines. Nielsen has in the past been critical of Hollywood for its lack of female roles, saying \"you think once you've shown what you can do, and your movies have been successful, that snap, you work. So to discover the difference between guys' roles and girls' roles made me plain mad. It's unjust.\" But Nielsen has refused to be pigeonholed, seemingly drawn to difficult roles in controversial movies. She appeared in French movie \"Demonlover\", which dealt with pornography, violence and corporate amorality, while more recent films have taken on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Danish drama \"Br\u00f8dre\" (U.S. title \"Brothers\") is about a soldier who returns from Afghanistan a broken man, unable to communicate his experiences from the conflict. Playing his wife, Nielsen put in a powerful performance that won her awards and served to highlight how Hollywood had underused her talents. \"The Situation\" in 2006 was billed as the first film to be made about the Iraq war and told the story of ordinary Iraqis caught up in the conflict, while \"Battle of Seattle\" examined how peaceful protests erupted into riots when the World Trade Organization met in Seattle in 1999. Of her choice of subject matter, Nielsen says that rather than making a political point she is trying to show the human aspects of the conflicts. But Nielsen makes it clear that her career is not the focus of her life and she stresses the importance of making time outside the movies. She is passionate about literature and art and she is currently dating Lars Ulrich, drummer of rock group Metallica. She had a son with him in 2007 and has another son from a previous relationship. \"I will always find something that I want to try and become better at. I always love to spend more time with my friends, more time with my family, my extended family. I always want to read more books,\" she says. Perhaps her commitment to her art, her interest in social issues and her disavowal of fame simply reflect her Danish upbringing, but there's no doubt that compared to many other Hollywood stars Connie Nielsen is a breath of fresh air.", "1f738e018a3a193d04ec22612e4fe6b01b4969fe": "(CNN)  -- Radovan Karadzic, whose Interpol charges listed \"flamboyant behavior\" as a distinguishing characteristic, was a practicing psychiatrist who came to be nicknamed the \"Butcher of Bosnia.\" Twice indicted in 1995 by the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Karadzic faces charges of genocide, complicity in genocide, extermination, murder, willful killing, persecutions, deportation, inhumane acts, terror against civilians and hostage-taking. While president of the so-called Serbian Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Karadzic's troops were reported to have massacred over hundreds of thousands of Muslims and Croats during a campaign of \"ethnic cleansing.\" Early estimates of the death toll from the 3-year war ranged up to 300,000, but recent research reduced that to about 100,000. The U.S. State Department had a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. His arrest brings an end to more than 10 years as a fugitive. Watch CNN's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour report on Karadzic's rise and fall \u00bb . Karadzic was born on June 19, 1945, in Petnjica, Montenegro. He studied psychiatry and medicine at the University of Sarajevo during the 1960s and took courses in psychiatry and poetry at Columbia University from 1974 to 1975. Karadzic, a Serb-Croat, in 1990 helped found the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS), a party aimed at unifying Serbs into a common state, and became its president. Two years later, he became president of the newly declared Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, later called \"Republika Srpska.\" During the next three years, he ordered Bosnian Serb forces to seize the majority of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He also announced, according to his U.N. indictment, six \"strategic objectives\" for the Serbian people. They included the establishment of state borders between the Serbs and the other two ethnic communities, Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats. Answering to him, according to the indictment, was Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic. From May 1992, the indictment alleged, Bosnian Serb forces under Mladic's command targeted civilian areas of Sarajevo with shelling and sniping during a three-year conflict within the city. In July 1995, according to the U.N. indictment, troops under Mladic's command executed an estimated 7,000 Bosnian Muslim male prisoners in Srebrenica, a U.N. safe area, and then participated in a comprehensive effort to conceal the killings. The massacre is considered the worst in Europe since World War II. The indictment states that Bosnian Serb forces acted under Karadzic's direction and worked to \"significantly reduce the Bosnian Muslim, Bosnian Croat and other non-Serb populations\" in municipalities that were seized. Karadzic was last seen in public in September 1996, a year after the Dayton Peace Accords brought a formal end to the conflict and banned anyone accused of war crimes, including him, from office. He reportedly shaved his trademark bushy hair, grew a beard and donned priest's robes, moving from monastery to monastery in the mountains to avoid capture. CNN Correspondent Alessio Vinci said: \"He enjoyed protection from the local population, wherever he was hiding. Legend has it he disguised himself as a priest to take part in his mother's funeral. \"In 2002, after NATO launched one of its many failed raids to try to arrest Karadzic in Bosnia, I interviewed his mother. At that time she said: 'Serbs are righteous people and I can see that they support him, and that they adore him the way he is. They would lose their lives to protect him.'\" Despite years on the run, Karadzic wrote \"Miraculous Chronicles of the Night\" -- 1,200 copies of which sold out at the 2004 Belgrade International Book Fair. After his arrest was announced, Serb officials revealed the final chapter of his life on the run had seen Karadic reprise his medical role, working in a clinic in Belgrade under a false identity and heavily disguised by a white beard, long hair and spectacles. \"He moved freely throughout the city, and the fact that he even held a job at a medical practice and nobody knew about this contributes to the fact that his false identity was very elaborate,\" said Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic.", "2bb7b7d5a229ccb9c9b5b4fa1475a54297fc0a25": "(CNN) -- An estimated 125,000 Western lowland gorillas are living in a swamp in equatorial Africa, researchers reported Tuesday, double the number of the endangered primates thought to survive worldwide. Forest clearings draw large numbers of Western lowland gorillas searching for food. \"It's pretty astonishing,\" Hugo Rainey, one of the researchers who conducted the survey for the U.S.-based Wildlife Conservation Society, told CNN Tuesday. The last census on the species, carried out during the 1980s, estimated that there were only 100,000 of the gorillas left worldwide. Since then, the researchers estimated, the numbers had been cut in half. WCS survey teams conducted the research in 2006 and 2007, traveling to the remote Lac Tele Community Reserve in northern Republic of Congo, a vast area of swamp forest. Acting on a tip from hunters who indicated the presence of gorillas, Rainey said that the researchers trekked on foot through mud for three days to the outskirts of Lac Tele, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the nearest road. \"When we went there, we found an astonishing amount of gorillas,\" said Rainey, speaking from the International Primatological Society Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland. Though researchers did spot some gorillas, they based their estimate on the number of gorilla nests found at the site, Rainey said. Each gorilla makes a nest to sleep in at night. \"This is the highest-known density of gorillas that's ever been found,\" Rainey said.  Watch a glimpse of gorilla life in African swamp \u00bb . Western lowland gorillas are listed as critically endangered, the highest threat category for a species. Their populations are declining rapidly because of hunting and diseases like Ebola hemorrhagic fever, whose symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting and internal and external bleeding.  Take a closer look at the Western lowland gorilla \u00bb . While the discovery in northern Congo indicates that the gorilla population remains stable in some areas, it is likely that gorillas will remain critically endangered because the threats facing the species are so great, Rainey said. iReport.com: Share photos and video of gorillas in zoos or the wild . \"We know very little about Ebola and how it spreads,\" he said. \"We don't even know the animal that spreads it around.\" The goal now, Rainey said, is to work with the Congolese government and donors to protect the areas in which the gorillas are known to be living. Western lowland gorillas, which are found in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Nigeria as well as the Republic of Congo, are the most numerous and wide-ranging of the four gorilla subspecies, each of which is threatened by extinction, the WCS says.  See where the gorillas live \u00bb . Illegal hunting and habitat loss have also threatened the Cross River gorillas, found in the highlands of Cameroon and Nigeria. Only about 250 to 300 are estimated to remain in the world, the WCS says. War, habitat loss, poaching and disease are the major threats to the mountain gorillas, made famous by researcher Dian Fossey and the film \"Gorillas in the Mist.\" The mountain gorilla population is starting to recover after decades of conservation work. From a population of around 230 in the 1970s, the mountain gorillas now number around 700, the WCS says. Poaching and war have also threatened populations of Grauer's gorillas in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the former Zaire. The WCS estimates their population to be around 16,000. News of the discovery of the Western lowland gorillas in northern Congo comes the same week as a report that almost 50 percent of the world's primates are in danger of extinction.

Is it eating into your household budget? Well, get used to it. Gas in California, the second worst state, hits $4.59 per gallon for regular unleaded in this July 14 photo. That's the word on the streets as the price of a gallon of gasoline soars to record highs. With regional differentials pushing the price much higher in some places, drivers and small-business owners are finding it hard to cope. But which states' motorists get the best deal, and in which states do drivers pay the most to fill-up? Here come the numbers . Alaska has the highest gas prices in the nation, with a gallon of regular gasoline at $4.623, followed by California at $4.583 as of June 30. Hawaii, Connecticut and Washington make up the top five states with highest prices, with New York and D.C. not far behind at $4.292 and $4.160 respectively. Best states to buy gas? Missouri comes out top at $3.862 for a gallon of regular, followed by Oklahoma at $3.866, South Carolina, Mississippi and Arkansas. Iowa, Kansas and Alabama are next in line. AOL Autos: Cars with 30+ MPG for $300 or less per month . Past prices . We use the term 'best states to buy gas' with this caveat: Back in June 2004, gas hovered at around $1.74 a gallon, according to figures from gasbuddy.com. Geoff Sundstrom, AAA's fuel price analyst, said the primary reasons for rising fuel prices are an increase in demand for petroleum products across the globe and a need for investment in refining infrastructure. \"Right now, it is almost impossible to know where oil and gas prices will be in six months to a year,\" he said. \"It's easy to assume that the world economy will continue to grow, we are very clearly at risk of an economic downturn and perhaps a severe economic downturn which could influence the demand side to the point where oil and gas prices may drop. \"In 10 to 20 years out, oil and gasoline will continue to be more expensive. But given what's happening in the markets right now, there is some potential that [the] demands side of the equation could fall off a cliff.\" AOL Autos: Consumer Reports on best fuel-efficient used cars . Why so expensive in California? Marie Montgomery, spokeswoman for the Automobile Club of Southern California, says the primary reason behind the high price of gas in California is \"market segmentation,\" a marketing term that basically means California (along with many other states) has developed a \"boutique blend\" of fuel in a bid to uphold environmental or ecological standards. In California's case, this blend helps clear the state's notorious smog. \"We can't use gas they made for Iowa. We use a special blend with additives in it, an ethanol mix,\" Montgomery said. \"When you do that, you can only use refineries that make that gas [mix]. The refineries in California are a major supplier, but, when prices are high and there's not another supplier, we have to go where they make that mix.\" She pointed out that refineries in Oregon and Washington produce the gas product, and there is a pipeline to Alaska, but that the only other options are shipping in the blend from elsewhere in the nation or Asia, which is not cost-efficient. \"People have to figure out how to deal with this on a long-term basis. We've been telling motorists to carpool and here we are in summer, and prices have barely come down,\" she said. \"Usually we're about a month into a downturn, it's cyclical: Prices go up in spring and spike in May, which isn't happening this year. Prices may not come down a lot.\" Less misery in Missouri . Michael Right, vice president of public affairs for AAA Missouri, said his state is usually among the top three in terms of low gas prices. A contributing factor, he said, is that the state's per-gallon tax rate is the lowest in the nation. He said that most, if not all, states impose a tax on gasoline but few are as low as the 17 cents a gallon Missouri levies. And Missouri, unlike most other states, doesn't impose a sales tax on top of that. The state also benefits from good distribution via a crisscrossing network of pipelines which can, unusually, result in cheaper gas in rural areas than in major cities. The reason for this is the three types of gas used in the state. St Louis primarily uses reformulated gasoline. Conventional gas is sold in rural areas, and Kansas City uses low RVP (or low-emission) gasoline. Reformulated costs more than conventional gas, hence the higher cost in cities. \"In Illinois, it's not unusual to save 15 cents a gallon by crossing the river,\" Right said. AOL Autos: Best hybrid SUVs . Effects on station owners and operators . While the effects of soaring pump prices on consumers are well documented, owners and operators of service stations nationwide are also feeling the pain acutely. Dennis Decota, the executive director of the 135-year-old California Service Station and Automotive Repair Association and owner of a service station in Marin County, California, said high prices are \"extremely detrimental to business people. What it does is creates a financial hardship on customers, [leading to] less foot traffic to stores or repair facilities. It puts a strain on entire businesses; unbranded service stations are really at the end of their rope.\" Independent, unbranded stations have one retail philosophy: Offer the best price. They rely on oversupply by refineries which they buy at wholesale prices and sell cheaper than the branded competition, like Shell or Exxon (which have both announced they are quitting the service-station industry). But in the past six months, that supply curve has become inverted, which means owner-operators are paying more -- $37,000 a truckload -- for their gas than branded outlets. Decota noted some are losing as much as 15 cents a gallon on every sale. It's a hard time for the industry, he said. The blame for high oil prices is pretty evenly spread, Decota said. He did, however, point out that as a result of higher gas prices, California brought in $4.4 billion last year in sales taxes from its monthly sales of 1,300,000,000 gallons. In 2002, when gas prices averaged about $1.71 a gallon, it brought in $1.7 billion. DeCota advocates boosting refinery capacity from its current level of 88 percent to about 92 percent. He said refineries \"have their hands on the spigot. There is no shortage of crude. But if the government stepped up refinery capacity, that would put enough downward pressure to create competition among refineries.

John McCain said Wednesday that the crisis in Georgia should not be used to score political points, but his campaign has stepped up its attacks on Sen. Barack Obama's foreign policy credentials. Sen. John McCain says Russia's entry into the WTO should be reviewed. In response, Obama's top foreign policy aide suggested that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was willing to \"shoot from the hip\" and was acting irresponsibly by offering strong support for the Georgia government. On Wednesday, McCain continued his tough line against Russia, saying its potential membership in the World Trade Organization should be reviewed as a result of its actions in Georgia, as well its relationship with the G-8 nations, which represent the world's largest industrial economies. McCain also said that an international peacekeeping mission should be sent to Georgia and that NATO should re-consider adding Georgia and Ukraine, another former Soviet republic, to the alliance.  Watch McCain call Georgia's position 'perilous' \u00bb . \"After the events of the past six days, no one should wonder why countries on Russia's periphery so ardently seek the security guarantees alliance membership represents,\" McCain said during a campaign stop in Birmingham, Michigan. Russia has strenuously objected to both nations joining NATO. After President Bush said Wednesday that he was ordering the U.S. military to help Georgia's citizens, Obama applauded the move. \"The situation is still unstable, and Russia must back up its commitment to stop its violence and violation of Georgia's sovereignty with actions, not just words,\" Obama said in a statement. \"The United States should now join our European partners in direct, high-level diplomacy with both Georgia and Russia to seek immediate implementation of a cease-fire, and to achieve a lasting resolution to this crisis.\" The crisis in Georgia started Friday, when Russia moved troops in into South Ossetia after the Georgian government moved troops into breakaway territory. South Ossetia has been largely autonomous since 1991, but separatists would like to break with Georgia and either declare independence or join North Ossetia, which is part of Russia. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is heading to France and the Georgian capitol of Tbilisi, said Wednesday that she has been briefing both candidates on the conflict.  Watch President Bush declare 'America's unwavering support' for Georgia \u00bb .

Watch Obama condemn Russia's actions \u00bb . McCain said Wednesday that the crisis was not the time for partisan attacks. \"I know the people of Georgia have enjoyed an unprecedented period of prosperity and freedom. And I know that at this time they're suffering mightily,\" the Arizona Republican said. \"So maybe later on in the campaign, let's have a back-and-forth about who has comments or statements. Now, let's devote all our energy to helping resolve a situation which is fraught with human tragedy.\" But, despite McCain comments, the crisis in Georgia has dominated the political debate between the two candidates' campaigns in recent days. On Tuesday, Randy Scheunemann, McCain's top foreign policy adviser, attacked the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee's response to the situation in Georgia, saying his experience with the region amounted to a handful of paper statements. On the other hand, McCain's experience with Georgia runs deep, Scheunemann said, noting that McCain and the Georgian president were friends. \"There's a depth of knowledge, a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience that doesn't compare between the two on Russia policy,\" Scheunemann said. \"You can't compare a 15-year historical record to three or four statements over the course of 15 months.\" But Susan Rice, Obama's senior foreign policy adviser, said Tuesday that McCain's comments condemning Russia \"may or may not have complicated the situation.\" \"We cannot shoot from the hip,\" Rice told MSNBC on Tuesday. \"We cannot act on the basis of ideology or preconceived notions. When this crisis began, Barack Obama, the administration ... and all of our NATO allies took a measured and reasoned approach because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them.\" McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said Wednesday that his campaign was disappointed that Rice had launched \"inflammatory and baseless\" political attacks \"during an international crisis when bipartisanship is needed most.\" In response, Hari Sevugan, a spokesman for the Obama, said it was \"the absolute height of hypocrisy\" for the McCain campaign to \"play the victim\" after attacking Obama's \"strong and appropriate\" position on Georgia. Bill Schneider, a CNN senior political analyst, said McCain could use the situation in Georgia to highlight one his inherent advantages over Obama: his experience. But McCain's strong position in defiance of Russia also has risks, Schneider said. \"Some voters may worry: Does he want to start a new Cold War? The risk for McCain is that he could overplay the issue and frighten war-weary voters whose priorities right now lie closer to home,\" Schneider said.

Caton told the AP that the attacker didn't sit near the victim when he first got on the bus, about an hour before the attack. \"He sat in the front at first; everything was normal,\" Caton said. \"We went to the next stop, and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there. When he got on the bus again, he came to the back near where I was sitting. He put his bags in the overhead compartment. He didn't say a word to anybody. He seemed totally normal.\" Half an hour later, the attack began, Caton told the AP. \"There was no rage or anything. He was like a robot, stabbing the guy.\" The incident occurred on the first of two Greyhound Canada buses that were traveling together, Wambaugh said. The bus was carrying 37 passengers. As many passengers as possible among those not directly involved in the incident were transferred to the second bus, she said. Others were taken to a hotel in Brandon, where they were met by Greyhound managers and police, Wambaugh said. Once they are released, Greyhound will take them by bus to Winnipeg, and \"we will do whatever is required to help them, and that includes counseling,\" she added. Wambaugh declined to comment further. \"I don't want to compromise the investigation,\" she said. Copyright 2008 CNN.

Bricks and other debris clutter an alleyway in Pomona, near Los Angeles Tuesday afternoon. However, the temblor served as a warning to southern Californians who had not experienced an earthquake in some time: the \"Big One\" remains a possibility. \"This is a sample, a small sample,\" said Kate Hutton, a seismologist at the California Institute of Technology. \"This is somewhere between small and moderate.\" She said there is a 5 percent chance the quake could be a precursor to a larger earthquake. After 24 hours, she said, that chance will drop to 1 percent. \"Every earthquake relieves some stress,\" Hutton said. \"It's usually only a drop in the ocean. In other words, the amount of stress released by this earthquake is minuscule compared to the amount that's built up and is building up for the Big One when it happens some day in the future.\"  Watch Hutton say Tuesday's quake was a sign of bigger ones to come \u00bb . And when will that be? \"From a geologist's point of view, the answer has to be soon,\" she said. \"But geologists are used to thinking on millions of years and thousands of years time scale, so I don't think that gives any useful information for people, except be prepared at any time because it could happen at any time.\" A 5.4 magnitude quake is considered by the USGS to be \"moderate,\" which can cause slight damage to buildings and others structures. So far this year, 39 \"moderate\" earthquakes of between magnitude 5.0 and 5.9 have occurred in the United States, and 790 globally. The last moderate quake to strike California was a magnitude 5.4 in April in the northern part of the state. A magnitude 4.4 struck the greater Los Angeles area in August 2007. There is a 99 percent chance of California experiencing a quake of magnitude 6.7 or larger within the next 30 years, according to the Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, sponsored by the U.S. Geological Survey, the California Geological Survey and the Southern California Earthquake Center and published in Science Daily in April. \"This earthquake reminds us to be prepared,\" said California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. \"We were very fortunate that there were no serious injuries or property damage.\" He said he believes the state is \"as prepared as anyone can be. We have continuous discussions about that. We are fanatics about emergencies and to be ready.\" The largest earthquake in recent years in California was a magnitude 7.1 in 1999, Hutton said. But it was centered in the desert, near Twentynine Palms, in a sparsely populated area. Tuesday's quake struck about 11:42 a.m., according to the USGS. Its epicenter was about 2 miles southwest of Chino Hills and about 5 miles southeast of Diamond Bar. The epicenter was about 7.6 miles deep, making it a fairly shallow quake, according to CNN meteorologist Chad Meyers. In general, earthquakes centered closer to the surface produce stronger shaking and can cause more damage than those further underground. But most Southern California earthquakes tend to be fairly shallow, officials said. More than 30 aftershocks were recorded. Hutton said the largest was a magnitude 3.6. Los Angeles police said a downtown hotel sustained some structural damage, but no one was injured and the building was not evacuated. There were some unconfirmed reports of minor injuries. The White House was also monitoring the situation, said spokeswoman Dana Perino. Despite the absence of serious damage or injuries, some Los Angeles-area residents were left rattled. The quake was felt as far south as San Diego, California, and the USGS said it received reports of light shaking as far north as Rosamond, California, about 55 miles north-northeast of Los Angeles. Reports from those who felt the quake poured into CNN. Did you feel the quake? \"My house was like a fun house. Everything was moving,\" said Danny Casler, 28, of Huntington Beach. He said he was sleeping when his house began shaking, and some things fell in the living room. He said he ran out of the house in his boxer shorts. Attorney Kevin Crisp said he was on the phone with his law partner in Riverside, 65 miles away, who burst out, \"Big quake!\" Crisp said he felt it about five seconds later. \"This was very impressive. Long and very uniform. Really had the building going.\" He said doors were swinging on the hinges and bottles of wine were rolling back and forth on his shelf. \"It just started with a really strong jolt,\" said Wendy Criner. \"I ran and got my daughters from different rooms, and we squatted in the living room. I did have stuff fall off the shelf, some books in my daughters' room and some things in the kitchen.\" The quake knocked out a ground radar system at Los Angeles International Airport, but that has not interfered with operations, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Technicians were working to restore the system, which helps controllers monitor traffic on the ground. Also, tiles fell from the ceiling in one terminal as water flowed from a burst pipe. The calculation of the quake's magnitude fluctuated as seismologists reviewed the data. Initially classified as a magnitude 5.8, the quake's intensity was reduced to a 5.6 and then to a 5.4. Because the earthquake magnitude scale is exponential, a 5.8 magnitude quake is four to five times more intense than a 5.4. Two nuclear plants are in the vicinity of the quake's epicenter near Chino Hills, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The closest to the epicenter is in San Onofre, 50 miles south, but an NRC spokesman said, \"this is well below the threshold for any conceivable damage to the plants.\" \"In the U.S. particularly in California, buildings are generally built well enough that it takes about a 5.5 for there to be some damage, so we do have the potential for damage,\" said Don Blakeman, an analyst for the USGS. \"It depends on the structures [and] the ground the building is built on.\" He said he would expect objects to be knocked from shelves and some windows broken. \"It's kind of on the margin where you'll get some structural damage from these. We may find that some of the older homes and buildings that weren't retrofitted suffer more damage than the newer structures. \"I would expect some cracked buildings,\" he said. \"There is the potential for injuries, but hopefully we won't have too much of that.\" Blakeman's comments came before the quake's magnitude was dropped to a 5.4. However, he said afterward that the change does not affect his expectations, although obviously there is less potential for damage. Still, the quake jolted the nerves of many Californians. \"I've lived in California, I've lived through several of them,\" Margot Wagner of Santa Barbara told CNN. \"It's always a little unnerving.\" Copyright 2008 CNN.

Pakistan's Pervez Musharraf has until now stubbornly resisted pressure to quit. A senior State Department official familiar with the situation told CNN U.S. officials were in touch with Musharraf in the week leading up to the resignation. However, the official said, the United States made it clear that it would not get involved in the struggle between Musharraf and the newly elected Pakistani parliament. \"If he made a decision to go, or fight against it -- we didn't advise him either way,\" the official said. \"We really did keep our fingers out of this one.\" Musharraf is viewed as a keen ally of the West in the fight on terror, receiving billions in military aid from both and launching attacks on militant groups near the country's border with Afghanistan.  Watch Musharraf resign \u00bb . \"President Musharraf has been a friend to the United States and one of the world's most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism,\" said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice after Musharraf's announcement. \"We will continue to work with the Pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on Pakistan's future and its most urgent needs, including stemming the growth of extremism, addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability,\" she added. \"The United States will help with these efforts to see Pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable, prosperous, democratic, modern, Muslim nation.\" The Bush administration's main priority is a crackdown on Taliban and al Qaeda militants in Pakistan's tribal regions. The administration believes Pakistan's intelligence service is full of al Qaeda and Taliban loyalists, an accusation Pakistan denies.  View a timeline of Musharraf's time in power \u00bb . \"There is a great deal of frustration on the part of the U.S. government with Pakistan's inability to follow through on what the U.S. sees as its clear commitments,\" said Robert Grenier, a former CIA counterterrorism official, now a managing director at risk consultation firm Kroll. \"It remains very much to be seen whether this new democratically-elected leadership will really be able to follow through in a sustained and coherent way,\" he said. \"They haven't demonstrated an ability to do that.\" The United States has stepped up missile strikes inside Pakistan, killing dozens of militants, and head of the Army, Gen. Ashfaq Kiyani, is now the United States' closest ally in power. But some experts warn that U.S. pressure could go too far. \"The U.S. military has to be extremely cautious,\" said Rick Barton, a director and adviser with the non-profit Center for Strategic and International Studies who is a former U.N. and U.S. official. \"It could actually be setting the torch to the kindling inside the country.\" Musharraf told the nation in a televised address Monday that he would step down -- nearly nine years after he seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999. \"I don't want the people of Pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty,\" he said. Until now, Musharraf, 65, had stubbornly resisted pressure to resign. But his once-considerable power eroded significantly since February's election that pushed his party out of power. That pressure increased in the past few weeks as the new ruling party began making plans to impeach him. Only time will tell whether the power shift will benefit Pakistan, but \"it puts a lot more responsibility squarely on the government. There is no more excuse any more. They have to stand up and do things. They can't blame Musharraf,\" the State Department official said. The official said Musharraf isn't expected to try to undermine the government. \"I really don't think he has been a factor for six months,\" the official said. \"He hasn't been able to do that while he was in the presidency, and he won't be as well-positioned [out of the presidency] to interfere.\" Mohammedmian Soomro, the chairman of the upper house of the National Assembly, stepped into the president's role and will act as caretaker until a new president is chosen, which is expected to be in the next few weeks. Under Pakistan's constitution, the president is elected by a majority vote of Pakistan's four provincial assemblies and the two houses of the National Assembly. Since Musharraf's resignation, the United States hadn't yet spoken to the government under newly elected Prime Minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani, who visited Washington late last month. In a statement released by U.S. National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe, President George W. Bush said it was committed to a \"strong Pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror.\" \"President Bush looks forward to working with the Government of Pakistan on the economic, political and security challenges they face.\" British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said it was strongly committed to its alliance with Pakistan following Musharraf's resignation. He praised Musharraf's economic and security achievements, described Pakistan as a \"vital friend\" and said Britain's aid program for the country would continue. Meanwhile, an Afghanistan government spokesman said Musharraf's resignation would be good for Afghanistan. The Indian government said in a statement that it had no comment to make. \"This is an internal matter of Pakistan.\" Copyright 2008 CNN.

Matt Whitton has been fired from his job as a police officer because of his role in the hoax. Not everyone is laughing. In an exclusive interview with CNN affiliate WSB, the two hoaxers -- car salesman Rick Dyer and now-fired police officer Matt Whitton -- said the whole situation began as a joke and then got out of hand. \"It's just a big hoax, a big joke,\" Dyer said. \"It's Bigfoot,\" Dyer explained. \"Bigfoot doesn't exist.\" Whitton chimed in: \"All this was a big joke. It got into something way bigger than it was supposed to be.\"  Watch the two men explain their \"joke\" \u00bb . At a news conference in California last week, the two men had stood by their claims that they had discovered Bigfoot's corpse and had it on ice. Scientific analysis would prove it, they said. Not quite. Now the two Georgia men admit that the hairy, icy blob was an Internet-purchased Sasquatch costume stuffed with possum roadkill and slaughterhouse leftovers. Whitton and Dyer say that when they came up with the hoax, they had no idea it would become a media circus. \"It got legs and ran. It's crazy now,\" Dyer told WSB. Co-hoaxer Whitton agrees: \"It started off as some YouTube videos and a Web site. We're all about having fun.\" \"Fun\" isn't exactly how Clayton County Police Chief Jeff Turner sees it. He has kicked Whitton off the police force. \"He lied on national TV,\" Turner says of Whitton, \"so a defense attorney now could say, 'How do we know you're not lying now?' \" Whitton and Dyer had announced that they had found the body of a 7-foot-7-inch, 500-pound half-ape, half-human creature while hiking in the north Georgia mountains in June. They also said they had spotted about three similar living creatures. Still unclear is how much money Whitton and Dyer got out of the hoax. Steve Kulls, who maintains the SquatchDetective Web site and hosts a similarly named Internet radio program, first interviewed Dyer on July 28 for the radio program. On August 12, Kulls said, Dyer and Whitton \"requested an undisclosed sum of money as an advance, expected from the marketing and promotion.\" Two days later, after signing a receipt and counting the money, Dyer and Whitton showed the Searching for Bigfoot team the freezer containing what they claimed was the carcass: \"Something appearing large, hairy and frozen in ice,\" Kulls wrote on the Web site. It was, as many had suspected, an ape-like costume stuffed with entrails. After the news conference last week, Dyer and Whitton disappeared from view. The truth came out over the weekend. In a Web posting this week, Kulls wrote that \"action is being instigated against the perpetrators.\" The two hoaxers have hired attorney Steve Lister to represent them. \"There have been some threats made to them for both civil and criminal prosecution,\" Lister said. The attorney says the Bigfoot incident \"got out of hand.\" Dyer, asked whether he ever thought that the hoopla had become more than just a joke, implied that everyone should have known it was a hoax. \"Well, we told 10 different stories,\" he said. \"Everyone knew we were lying.\"", "62066d76f4ef9e06a1129551c41371bb5d2f7465": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A slim majority of Americans think churches should stay out of politics, according to a new survey. John McCain, the Rev. Rick Warren and Barack Obama together for a CNN broadcast forum on faith. The survey suggests that for the first time in more than a decade, there has been a shift away from the view that religious groups should influence social and political issues. Fifty-two percent of poll respondents said churches should stay quiet, while 46 percent said churches should express political views. The biggest shift has come among Republicans, one of the authors of the poll said. \"Overall, the number of people who say churches should not endorse political candidates is up slightly, but among Republicans it is up 11 points, and among white evangelical Republicans it is up 19 points,\" said Greg Smith, a research fellow at the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. \"There is a slight uptick, from 40 percent to 46 percent, among people who are uncomfortable to have politicians talking about religion, but it is up 10 points among Republicans,\" he added. Four years ago, seven out of 10 conservatives approved of religious institutions expressing political views. But five out of 10 conservatives in Thursday's poll said it was appropriate. It seems that the more important social issues are to conservatives, the more likely they were to say that religion and politics should not mix. Among people who said gay marriage was a very important issue, the number saying houses of worship should keep out of politics doubled, from 25 percent to 50 percent. Among those who said it was not important, the number was essentially unchanged. Respondents were also more likely to say houses of worship should not meddle in politics if they considered the major political parties to be hostile to religion. The new figures bring Republican views into line with those of Democrats and independents. A 14-point gap between Republican and Democratic views on the subject in August 2004 fell to one point in the new survey. But Smith cautioned against reading the survey to mean basic conservative philosophy was changing. \"It appears to be frustration with the contemporary political landscape more than an underlying philosophical shift,\" he said. \"It is not the case the conservatives are uncomfortable with a political role for religion, but we do see increasing discomfort with churches getting involved with politics.\" \"Voting intentions among white evangelicals have not changed at all,\" Smith added. Republican candidate Sen. John McCain \"has a huge lead even among younger evangelicals.\" But social conservatives are lukewarm about McCain as compared to President Bush. Nearly seven out of 10 white evangelical Protestants and conservatives said they supported McCain; the number was slightly higher for Bush in August 2004. But four years ago, 57 percent of them said they backed Bush strongly. The number is 28 percent for McCain this year, with 40 percent saying they backed him, but not strongly. The number of people who think religious groups have too much influence over political parties grew -- for both Republicans and Democrats -- as did the percentage of people who are uncomfortable hearing politicians talk about how religious they are. Americans continue to see the Republican Party as more friendly to religion than the Democrats, although the Democrats closed the gap somewhat since reaching a low point in 2006. Other survey results showed little change from the past. Two out of three Americans continue to say churches should not endorse candidates for president, and most still feel a president should have strong religious beliefs. The survey was conducted by the Pew Research Center for People & the Press and the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life by interviewing 2,905 adults nationwide by phone between July 31 and August 10. On Saturday, Obama and McCain answered questions that had religious overtones at a forum hosted by the Rev. Rick Warren. The pastor of Southern California's Saddleback Church is author of the best-selling book \"The Purpose-Driven Life.\" Asked when life begins, McCain was quick to say \"at the moment of conception.\" McCain's response was met with huge applause from the audience. \"I have a 25-year pro-life record in the Congress, in the Senate, and as president of the United States, I will be a pro-life president, and this presidency will have pro-life policies,\" he said. When Obama was asked about when life begins, the pro-choice candidate said that decision is \"above my pay grade.\" The response garnered criticism from liberal and conservative thinkers who said Obama tried to dodge the issue. Obama said although he's pro-choice and supports a woman's right to abortion, his goal is to reduce the number of abortions in America. \"On this particular issue, if you believe that life begins at conception ... and you are consistent, then I can't argue with you on that,\" he said. \"What I can do is say, 'Are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies?' \"", "16c4a27e42066259797d93d5db0239bce0a15f18": "(CNN) -- A Swedish wrestler who discarded his bronze medal in a protest during the presentation ceremony has been stripped of the award and disqualified from the tournament in Beijing. A disgruntled Abrahamian drops his bronze medal before leaving the arena during the presentation ceremony. The International Olympic Committee said it was also officially disqualifying Ara Abrahamian, 35, from his event, Greco-Roman wrestling. Abrahamian was beaten in the 84-kilogram class by eventual gold medal winner Andrea Minguzzi of Italy. He complained that \"blatant errors in judging\" caused him to lose the match and said he felt that he deserved the gold. The Swede shouted at the referee before confronting the judges. During Thursday's presentation ceremony, he took off his medal and left it in the center of the competition mat before walking off. The IOC said Abrahamian violated two rules of the Olympic charter, one that bans any sort of demonstrations and another that demands respect for all Olympic athletes. \"The awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual, acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants,\" the IOC said. \"Any disruption by any athlete, in particular a medalist, is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the Olympic Movement. It is also contrary to the spirit of fair play.\" Abrahamian never expressed regret or offered an apology, the IOC said. The international weightlifting federation was asked to consider further sanctions against him. His medal was the third stripped at the Beijing Games. On Friday, North Korean shooter Kim Jong Su had his silver and bronze medals taken away after failing a doping test. Also expelled for doping violations have been Spanish cyclist Maria Isabel Moreno and Vietnamese gymnast Thi Ngan Thuong Do. Abrahamian's case is not the first of its kind. A weightlifter at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics was stripped of his bronze medal after rejecting it during the medal ceremony. Ibragim Samadov, competing in the light heavyweight category for the Unified Team of the former Soviet Union, was upset with his performance and refused to have the medal placed around his neck and only accepted it in his hand. He then put it down and walked off. Samadov later apologized, but the IOC upheld its decision to disqualify him, and he was later banned for life by the sport's governing body.", "8626e8d0c96f4d12eca92423e0c43c6ea3e53545": "MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Fay made landfall in southwestern Florida early Tuesday, coming ashore at Cape Romano just south of Marco Island, the National Hurricane Center said.

Matos reacted in extraordinary fashion to being disqualified by Chelbat. Matos, who took gold in Sydney in 2000, was winning 3-2, with just over a minute left in the second round, when he fell to the mat after being hit by his opponent, Kazakhstan's Arman Chilmanov. Matos lay down, awaiting medical attention, but was then disqualified by referee Chakir Chelbat of Sweden for taking too much injury time. A furious Matos reacted by pushing a judge, then pushed and kicked Chelbat in the face. It left the Swede with blood pouring from his lip while Matos spat on the floor and was then escorted out of the arena. \"We didn't expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur,\" said World Taekwondo Federation secretary general Yang Jin-suk. \"I am at a loss for words,\" he told the Associated Press. Matos' coach, Leudis Gonzalez, is also in hot water for his angry reaction and claiming the Kazakhs had tried to fix the match. \"This is an insult to the Olympic vision, an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and, in my opinion, an insult to mankind,\" Yang added. Although the arena announcer said Matos and his coach were banned effective immediately, Yang said due process must be followed before officially banning the two. It was not the only controversial moment in the four-day taekwondo competition, which was marred by several protests against judging decisions. Earlier Saturday, China's double gold medalist Chen Zhong crashed out in the quarterfinals after initially being declared the winner. She was fighting Britain's Sarah Stevenson, who scored with a clear head kick -- worth two points -- in the final seconds of their bout. That would have put Stevenson ahead and into the semifinals, but the judges ruled Stevenson's kick wasn't solid enough for points, and Chen was declared the winner 1-0. After Britain protested, the result was changed to put Stevenson in the semifinal. She lost that to jeers from the partisan Chinese crowd, but later won a bronze medal match. It was the first time a match result has been overturned since taekwondo became an official Olympic sport. Copyright 2008 CNN.

Fayetteville, North Carolina, police released this undated photo of 2nd Lt. Holley Wimunc. Authorities have been searching for the missing soldier, Army 2nd Lt. Holley Wimunc, 24, since a fire torched her North Carolina apartment on July 10. Marine Cpl. John Wimunc and fellow Marine Lance Cpl. Kyle Alden were initially charged with arson, but after police interviews Wimunc was charged with first-degree murder, said Fayetteville Police Chief Tom Bergamine. Alden was charged with felony accessory after the fact to first-degree murder, Bergamine said. Both were taken to Cumberland County's jail and held without bond, he said. Earlier, a witness found a charred body in woods, but Detective Jeff Locklear told reporters that police were still awaiting a positive identification from the medical examiner and could not say for certain it was Holley Wimunc.

Esmin Green's daughter, Tecia Harrison, says disciplinary action against hospital workers is not enough for her. Green's family is also calling for criminal charges against hospital workers, who they say failed to help her and then attempted to cover up the circumstances of her death. \"My sister was killed twice,\" said Brenda James, Green's sister. \"First, by those who neglected to offer her the needed health care. Secondly, she was killed by those who tried to cover up this criminal action.\" The family has retained a lawyer, Sanford Rubenstein, to file the suit. Green, a Jamaican immigrant, had been involuntarily admitted to the Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, on June 18 for what the hospital described as \"agitation and psychosis.\" Surveillance camera footage captured the mother of six sliding off of a chair and onto the floor of waiting room of the hospital's psychiatric emergency department, where she lay convulsing for more than a hour before anyone helped her. The footage appears to capture several employees passing by her as she lay on the floor struggling.

Morgan Tsvangirai's MDC faction has a slim majority following parliamentary elections. \"This is historic as it ceases to be a rubber-stamping house,\" Moyo said after winning the position. \"It will ensure that progressive laws are passed. I promise to be professional.\" Moyo -- the national chairman of the main Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party -- received 110 votes while his only opponent, Paul Themba-Nyathi, received 98 votes. The speaker of the parliament is the fourth most powerful post in Zimbabwe. Themba-Nyathi represented the splinter MDC faction led by Arthur Mutambara, but he had support of President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party. The vote took place hours after Mugabe swore in lawmakers, five months after they were elected. Two members of the main MDC -- led by presidential candidate Morgan Tsvangirai -- were arrested as they arrived at the opening session, but they were released after a short time, according to a government spokesman. An MDC official said the arrests were part of the \"sinister agenda of this regime\" to \"tilt the balance of numbers in their favour during the voting for the speaker of parliament.\" One of those detained -- Shuwa Mudiwa -- appeared back in parliament, but the other member -- Elia Jembere -- was not seen, according to sources. Government spokesman Bright Matonga said Jembere had been accused of rape, but that he has been released from custody. A third member -- Elton Mangoma -- escaped an arrest attempt when other party members came to his rescue, MDC officials said. Attendance at the session of parliament is important since the membership is closely divided between the MDC and the Mugabe's ZANU-PF. The ruling ZANU-PF party lost its majority in the 210-seat parliament in elections in March, but vote recounts and political violence have delayed the body from convening until now. Final results gave 100 seats to an MDC faction led by Morgan Tsvangirai, the party's presidential candidate. President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF got 99 seats. An offshoot of the main MDC party, led by Arthur Mutambara, won 10 seats. An independent candidate won one seat. Tsvangirai, who was locked in a bitter presidential contest with Mugabe, had objected to Mugabe's decision to convene parliament, saying it could \"decapitate\" power-sharing talks that have been on hold for the past two weeks. Still, Tsvangirai said he would attend the swearing-in ceremony. MDC party spokesman Nelson Chamisa said all MDC members elected to parliament were expected to attend \"except those few MPs who are still in hiding.\" CNN's Nkepile Mabuse in Johannesburg, South Africa contributed to this report.", "3276a47234f0aa9eb7d4d06940ffb912be059454": "SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir (CNN) -- Violent protests continued across Kashmir Wednesday, as the death toll from the past two days of demonstrations rose to 20, a senior police official said. Hindu protesters shout slogans against Jammu and Kashmir state governor N. N. Vohra. Three people critically injured in the protests died on Wednesday, adding to the already high tensions. Several thousand people joined the Wednesday morning funeral procession for one of the victims in old Srinagar city. The region -- which is split between India and Pakistan -- has been a flashpoint of violence between Hindus and Muslims for more than a month. The violence was triggered by the Hindu government's attempt to transfer land to a Hindu shrine. The latest round of protests was started on Monday by fruit growers who were upset that Hindu protesters had blocked a highway leading into India, preventing their crops from getting to market. It has spiraled into demonstrations against the deaths. A police official said 200 people have been injured in the two days of protests. A round-the-clock curfew in Srinagar, the summer capital of Kashmir, was lifted for several hours Wednesday to allow residents to buy essential commodities. During the curfew suspension, an angry mob attacked a policeman in Srinagar's old city, torching his motorbike. Speaking Wednesday, Kashmir's Indian-appointed governor N. N.

Shaun Gopaul woke up at 4 a.m. on May 12, 2007, and waited at a battle position south of Baghdad for members of his company to pick him up. Sgt. Alex Jimenez, left, and Spc. Shaun Gopaul had served in the military together since 2005. One of those he expected to see was the larger-than-life figure of Sgt. Alex Jimenez, who cared so much about his fellow soldiers that he made sure every one was comfortable and who cared so much about the Iraqis he was fighting for that he learned Arabic on his own so he could talk with them. \"He was a good guy, you know. He had a big heart,\" Gopaul said. But Jimenez and the other soldiers never came. While he was waiting, Gopaul heard on the radio that Sgt. Alex Jimenez -- the first person he met in the company and also his best friend -- and other members of his company had been ambushed and captured by insurgents in a section of Iraq known as the Triangle of Death. Gopaul said Friday that during the time Jimenez and other members of the company were missing, he tried to keep upbeat and hoped that his best friend would come home safely. But on Friday the military confirmed they found the bodies of Jimenez and 19-year-old Pvt. Byron W. Fouty and returned them to the United States. \"In a way, I'm glad that he's home,\" Gopaul said. \"It's just not in the way that we wanted.\" The body of a third soldier who was captured -- Pfc. Joseph J. Anzack Jr., 20, of Torrance, California -- was pulled from the Euphrates River in Babil province 11 days after the attack. After they began serving together in 2005, Gopaul said he and Jimenez were inseparable. When Gopaul arrived, Jimenez offered to let him bunk with him because many of the servicemen were younger than he. It was Gopaul's first tour in Iraq and Jimenez, who was on his second tour, took it upon himself to help new soldiers from Company D, 4th Battalion, 31st Regiment -- nicknamed the polar bears -- learn the ropes. \"He grabbed all the new guys and put us where we needed to be and showed us how to do our jobs,\" Gopaul said. \"He saved our lives by showing us the right way to do things and where to be so we wouldn't be hurt.\" Jimenez, 25, even took it upon himself to start learning Arabic, Gopaul said. He studied the language until he eventually became fluent. Then, he taught the entire platoon and company so they would have an easier time talking to locals. \"It was awesome, because if we didn't have an interpreter we had him to help out,\" Gopaul said. During their free time the two soldiers wrote and sang music -- often reggaeton -- sometimes about being in the Army. Above all, Gopaul said, Jimenez was known for his sense of humor and always being there for anyone who needed it. \"I've been getting a lot of calls from a lot of people across different battalions who knew him and knew the size of his heart, Gopaul said. The last time he spoke to Jimenez, Gopaul was returning from time off and Jimenez called to let him know what was going on in Iraq and see how his good friend was doing. \"I told him 'I'll see you in a couple days,' \" Gopaul said. \"But that was it. I never saw him again.\" Gopaul said he has taken a 14-day leave from service and will go to visit members of the Jimenez family who live in New York and Boston, Massachusetts. Black ribbons of mourning replaced the yellow ribbons around the Jimenez home Thursday afternoon. A POW/MIA flag that had been hanging from the home for more than a year was also replaced by a U.S. flag. \"This has all been pretty hard,\" Gopaul said. \"But one thing is for sure -- we'll never forget him.\"", "e43fc7e34d05a75894279f55935b25040a6d7017": "MOGADISHU, Somalia (CNN)  -- A roadside bombing in Somalia's capital killed 21 women who were cleaning rubbish from a southern Mogadishu street on Sunday morning, a hospital official said. Mogadishu residents gather around victims of the bomb attack along the city's Maka Al Mukarama Road. The bomb blast wounded another 46 people, most of them Somali women who had gathered to clean Maka Al Mukarama Road in southern Mogadishu's Kilometer 4 district, according to Medina Hospital director Dr. Dahir Dhere. \"It suddenly turned the area into a carnage, scattering body parts of the street cleaners into a large area,\" said witness Asha Ise Gedi. \"There were pools of blood everywhere. I have never seen such mass killing.\" \"They were innocent poor mothers or sisters,\" Gedi said. \"Why did they deserve this?\" It is unclear who is behind the attack. Mogadishu Mayor Mohamed Omar Habeb Mohamed Dhere, who was recently fired by the country's prime minister, blamed the Islamic Courts Union for waging the attack. But the head of the Islamist insurgent group, Abid Rahim Ise Adow, denied any involvement and blamed Somalia's government for orchestrating the attack. The victims were participating in a program that allows Somali women to work as street cleaners in exchange for food. The United Nations' World Food Program organized the program, which began last year and is administered by Mogadishu's regional authority. Mogadishu has been the site of violence in recent months between Ethiopian troops and Islamist fighters. Somalia's current transitional government is trying to maintain control of the capital, with the help of the better-equipped Ethiopian forces. On Saturday, two-thirds of the Somali government ministers announced their resignations, blaming Prime Minister Nur Hassan Nur Ade's \"dictatorship,\" which they said included his firing of Mogadishu's mayor. Nur Ade said he suspects the mass resignations were aimed at weakening implementation of the peace agreement between Somalia's transitional government and the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia. He said he had no plans to resign. The peace agreement, signed June 9 in Djibouti, calls for a cease-fire between Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government and the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia, an opposition group that includes members of the Islamist Court Union which overthrew the government in 2006. The ICU was ousted from power later that year by Ethiopian forces, with the support of Somalia's transitional government. If followed, the peace deal would pave the way for a withdrawal of Ethiopian troops -- a major sticking point for Islamist fighters who oppose their presence. The agreement calls on the alliance to dissociate itself from armed groups still fighting the government and for all sides to allow \"unhindered humanitarian access and assistance\" to all Somalis. A joint committee led by U.N. officials will monitor the agreement's implementation. Ethiopian forces became embroiled in an Islamist insurgency after the Ethiopian forces invaded Somalia in December 2006 to overthrow the ICU leaders and reinstall the transitional government. As guerrilla attacks mounted, efforts to replace the Ethiopians with an African Union-led peacekeeping mission faltered. Ethiopia's invasion had the blessing of Somalia's government and the United States, which accused the ICU of harboring fugitives from the al Qaeda terrorist movement. The conflict displaced hundreds of thousands of Somalis, further worsening a humanitarian crisis that dates back to the collapse of the country's last government in 1991. The situation has been exacerbated by drought, continual armed conflicts in central and southern Somalia, and high inflation on food and fuel prices.

Fay tore through Barefoot Bay, Florida, south of Melbourne Tuesday. Fay could strengthen into a hurricane when it swings over Florida again Thursday, according to the center. \"This storm is going to be with us for a while,\" said Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. \"Looks like it could be a boomerang storm.\" A hurricane watch has been issued for Florida's east coast, from north of Flagler Beach to Altamaha Sound. At 5 p.m., the center of the storm was about 60 miles southwest of Melbourne, the hurricane center said. Fay was traveling north-northeast at 8 mph. Florida Power & Light reported more than 93,000 customers without power in 20 counties. Most of the outages -- 34,000 -- were in Collier County, where Fay came ashore earlier in the day. As many as 9,700 residents in Brevard County were without power Tuesday evening, according to David Waters, the county Emergency Operations Center spokesman. A Brevard County tornado that hit about 1:45 p.m. damaged more than 50 homes, leaving nine uninhabitable, according to the emergency operations center. Three people suffered minor injuries, officials said. Fay's maximum sustained winds remained near 65 mph, with higher gusts, forecasters said. A storm tracker in Moore Haven, near the west bank of Lake Okeechobee, reported winds up to 81 mph in the afternoon. \"Some fluctuations in intensity are likely this afternoon and tonight as Fay moves inland over Florida. Some strengthening is expected when Fay moves over the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday,\" according to the hurricane center. The storm was earlier buffeting Lake Okeechobee with high winds as it moved north and northeast through Florida, leaving a trail of flooding, broken trees and power outages. At midday, the hurricane center issued two tornado warnings -- for St. Lucie and Indian River counties, and tornado watches were in effect for several areas, most of them ending at 4 p.m. A possible twister hit Wellington in Palm Beach County, where the violent weather ripped a small barn off its foundation and left a horse standing unhurt on a concrete slab, authorities said. Dr. Bob Smith, an associate veterinarian at the Palm Beach Equine Clinic, said an 8-year-old quarterhorse named Onyx was in a stall, untied, when the suspected tornado hit about 2 a.m. It destroyed the structure \"and left the horse standing there unscathed,\" Smith said. iReport.com: Flooding, beached whale as Fay hits . When he came to work several hours later, a technician had rescued the horse, who was not visibly rattled, Smith said. \"She's just calm and cool,\" he said. \"She's fine.\" Smith said roof tiles flew off the veterinary clinic and broke car windows in a nearby parking lot. The storm also picked up a horse trailer and smashed it into another horse trailer, he said. A tropical storm warning remained in effect along Florida's east coast from north of Ocean Reef to Flagler Beach, including Lake Okeechobee. A tropical storm watch covered that coast north of Flagler Beach to Fernandina Beach. Fay is expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain over southern and east-central Florida, with possible maximum amounts of 15 inches. Three to 5 inches of rain were possible in the northwestern Bahamas. Steve Delai, deputy chief of Fire and Rescue for Palm Beach County, said he could not confirm a tornado had hit the southeast county, but the damage was \"consistent with a tornado.\" \"It's clear that the damage was in a very linear fashion,\" he said. Crist said 31 schools were closed in the region Tuesday as a precaution. All but four, including Brevard County, will be open Wednesday. \"Floridians should continue to monitor local news reports, stay calm and exercise common sense,\" he advised. \"Please remember to be cautious when testing generators and other hurricane-related equipment. \"In areas where the weather is getting worse, stay inside and stay off the roads and be safe,\" Crist added.

U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urges the release of oil from strategic reserves as a way to bring down gas prices. Pelosi and fellow House Democrats have staunchly opposed Republicans' request for a vote on the drilling. Some Republicans stayed in chambers after Congress adjourned for the session, making speeches on energy policies, in an attempt to get Democrats to come back for a vote. Reacting to Pelosi's remarks, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said the speaker should call the House of Representatives back from its summer recess immediately if she is sincere about a vote on off-shore drilling. \"Our message to Speaker Pelosi is very simple: We are ready to vote on more energy production and lower gas prices right now, and we should not wait one more day to begin giving the American people the relief they expect and deserve,\" Boehner said. \"If you meant what you said last night, we welcome you and your Democratic colleagues to join us in our historic call to action on American energy.\" On Monday night, Pelosi said the vote would need to be part of a larger discussion that would include investing in renewable energy resources and releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Those options would help bring both immediate and long-lasting solutions to the energy crisis, she said. In her interview with King, Pelosi talked about what the government and country needs to do to avert the energy crisis and quickly bring down gas prices. The following is an edited version of the interview: . Larry King: OK, Madam Speaker, author of \"Know Your Power,\" why don't you bring [Congress] back? Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Well, it's interesting to hear Sen. [John] McCain talk about bringing Congress back. He wasn't even in Congress this last session when we really had two very important bills on energy -- one to give tax credit for wind, solar and other renewable resources, and another about hybrid cars and the rest. So he wasn't in to vote when were in session and now he's saying call it back in. And then one of the others said to the president, call Congress back in. And the president said no. The president said no. But the point is this: The American people are suffering. We have to do what is best for them. How do we bring down the prices at the pump? We have said to the president, the fastest way to do this if in 10 days the price can come down if you will free our oil. Over 700 million barrels of oil the president is sitting on of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. No. 1, free our oil. No. 2, they want to drill. If they want to drill, we have 68 million acres in the Lower 48 that they can drill in that are permitted and all the rest. Three, stop the speculation. Four, renew -- invest in renewable energy resources, which will bring a faster return than drilling offshore, which will take 10 years and produce 2 cents' reduction in 10 years off the price at the pump. And then use natural gas. Natural gas is so plentiful. It's better for the environment, and it is cheaper. So there are things that Congress can do, and we have voted on this over and over again. But the Republicans and the president have resisted. Instead, they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas. Well, we can do that. We can have a vote on that. But it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them. King: Would you vote yes on a package that includes drilling? Pelosi: I would not. It depends how the drilling is put forth. But I don't -- that is not excluded, let me say it that way. It depends how that is proposed, if the safeguards are there. Now, mind you, 68 million acres -- 10 million more acres in Alaska where they can drill. But if there's -- if we can get some great things, in terms of renewable energy resources: a renewable electricity standard, wind, solar, biofuels and the rest in that context, because if you make a decision only to go with the offshore drilling, you are increasing our dependence on fossil fuels, and you will never free yourself of that addiction unless you invest in the renewable energy resources that are good for the environment, cheaper for the consumer and will reverse global warming. And the consumer is our first responsibility. The American taxpayer owns this oil offshore, by the way. Let me make this one final point. This oil is owned by the American taxpayers. The oil companies drill. We give them money to drill there. But we get very little in return. So I think as we have this debate, which is a very healthy one to have and I welcome it; we have to review and realign the relationship between our oil, Big Oil's profits and what it means to the consumer and the taxpayer. King: Do you expect -- do you suspect the oil companies of having a lot of clout here, influence over the Republicans? Pelosi: Of course. Yes, they rule. And that's what we'll find out. King: They rule? Pelosi: When we have this vote, when we really define it and where the choice is clear to the American people -- I mean, do you know what -- Exxon Mobil, their last quarter, their profits were historic. Last year, they were historic. They outdid themselves this year already in this second quarter. And they insist that we pay them to drill. They need an incentive to drill in order to make over $11 billion in one quarter. And it just doesn't make sense. We should be using that money to invest in renewable resources, tax credit for wind and solar, etc. and invest in the technologies that will develop the battery and the rest, instead of giving Big Oil more profits. King: Do you expect to get a big enough majority in the Senate and House for the Democrats to overcome anything and get through your proposals? Pelosi: Well, I hope we can do some of it before we even leave this session. I think we can -- hopefully, we can do something before December. I will not subscribe to a hoax on the American people that if you drill offshore, you're going to bring down the price at the pump. Even the president says that's not true. Ten years, two cents -- we're saying 10 days, bring down the price, if the president would free our oil from the Strategic Petroleum [Reserve] -- from our stockpile -- owned by the taxpayers, purchased by the taxpayers. In the next election, I know that we will strengthen our majorities, increase their numbers, and we will have a Democratic president in the White House, and we will be able to address more fully really what I think is the challenge to our generation -- energy security and global warming.", "a34829c5a83a3ef39c34b57b65cc48c9bf11f14b": "TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Thirty people convicted of drug and other criminal charges will be hanged on Sunday, Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency reported Saturday. A convicted Iranian drug dealer is hanged from a crane in the southern city of Shiraz in September. The 30 had their cases tried by the highest judicial authorities and were found guilty of the charges brought against them, Iran's judiciary said in a statement. The verdicts are final, and the sentences will be carried out Sunday, according to Fars. According to Amnesty International, Iran executed 317 people last year, second only to China's 470. The U.S. executed 42 people in 2007, according to Amnesty International. The Iranian judiciary's statement said that all 30 were convicted of crimes including murder, murder in commission of a crime, disturbing public safety and security, being a public nuisance while drunk and being involved in illegal relationships -- relationships between men and women who are not married to each other. Kidnapping and using weapons while committing a crime were among the charges. The statement said that 20 of the people were convicted of drug and alcohol dealing, armed robbery and smuggling arms. The judiciary said it will provide more details later as to the crimes committed by those condemned and added that the hangings should serve as a warning to those who are contemplating committing such crimes. Others are awaiting trial, and their sentences will be carried out as soon as the verdicts are pronounced by the courts, the judiciary said. The judiciary asked the public to notify the authorities if they have any information that might lead to arrest and convictions of criminals. Iran's government launched a campaign March 20 to increase public security and bring the crime rate down. Police cracked down on drug dealers, whom they called criminal gang members, and habitual criminals who use guns in the commission of their crime.

Charles Schumer said Sunday the Bush administration is trying to \"blame the fire on the person who calls 911\" by suggesting he had a role in one of the costliest U.S. bank failures. Sen. Charles Schumer said the OTS \"ought to stop pointing false fingers of blame.\" Federal regulators with the Office of Thrift Supervision were \"asleep at the switch\" when it came to IndyMac's \"reckless\" behavior, the New York Democrat complained. The OTS announced Friday that it was taking over the $32 billion IndyMac and transferring control to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The OTS pointed the finger directly at Schumer for the failure, accusing him of sparking a bank run by releasing a letter that \"expressed concerns about IndyMac's viability.\"  Watch what's next for IndyMac \u00bb . \"In the following 11 business days, depositors withdrew more than $1.3 billion from their accounts,\" the OTS said in a statement announcing the California-based lender's takeover on Friday. The statement included a quote from OTS Director John Reich saying, \"Although this institution was already in distress, I am troubled by any interference in the regulatory process.\" Schumer, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, chairman of Congress' Joint Economic Committee and the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, rejected any suggestions of responsibility for IndyMac's collapse . \"OTS ought to stop pointing false fingers of blame and start doing its job to protect the future of the banking system, so that there won't be other IndyMacs,\" he said. Schumer's June 26 letter said he was \"concerned that IndyMac's financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers.\" In a Sunday news conference, he said everything in his letter was already known to the public. \"IndyMac was one of the most poorly run and reckless of all the banks,\" he said. \"It was a spinoff from the old Countrywide, and like Countrywide, it did all kinds of profligate activities that it never should have. Both IndyMac and Countrywide helped cause the housing crisis we're now in.\" The embattled Countrywide Financial Corp. was recently purchased by Bank of America.

Steve Kastenbaum talks with Salomon Leyderman outside the Adath Israel synagogue in Havana, Cuba. I went to Cuba to report on a country that appears to be on the cusp of a new era. My focus was the future of U.S.-Cuban relations and the reforms under Cuban leader Ra\u00fal Castro. But a vague notion of exploring my family history in Cuba resulted in the most memorable story of the entire journey. More than 15,000 Jews were living in Cuba in the 1940s and '50s. Today, there are about 1,500. My grandmother, the daughter of Russian immigrants, was born in Havana, and my grandfather came to Cuba when he was just 3 years old. His family left Germany in the 1920s. To me, they were as much Cuban as they were Jewish.  Watch how everyday life has changed for Cubans \u00bb . My grandparents left Cuba in the late '40s so that their children would be born in the United States. The last members of my family to leave Cuba did so post-revolution, in the 1960s. I was eager to see what had become of the places they left behind.  Slideshow: Learn more about the Jewish population in Cuba \u00bb . When Castro lifted restrictions on religion in the mid-'90s, the once-dilapidated building that houses congregation El Patronato came back to life. Today, it's a thriving center for the local Jewish community. When I arrived, the children's summer program was in full swing. A few dozen boys and girls were laughing and playing as they waited for lunch to be served. I wasn't prepared for the wave of emotions that overcame me. Had things been different, I could have been just like them.  Slideshow: Experience more of Kastenbaum's explorations of Cuba \u00bb . My next stop took me to Habana Viejo. Jewish life in Cuba has its roots in Old Havana, where my great-grandparents settled. I walked the streets where they lived and stopped in at the only remaining kosher butcher in town. I passed the building that once housed the local synagogue where my grandparents were wed.  Watch efforts to restore parts of Havana \u00bb . The current home of Adath Israel is a few blocks away. At the front door, Salomon Leyderman introduced himself to me as the oldest Jew in Cuba. He's 86. I took out some old family photos, and Salomon immediately recognized my great-grandfather, Salomon Sher. He shouted out in Spanish, \"they were tailors!\" I couldn't believe my ears. This 86-year-old man told me how my great-grandfather was highly regarded in the community, how he belonged to many social organizations and how after the revolution, he made it possible for many Cuban Jews to leave the island and join him in Miami, Florida. As he looked at a family portrait, Salomon began to cry. He recognized Luis Sher, my grandmother's brother. He said Luis gave him as a gift a suit to wear at his bar mitzvah, the Jewish ceremony marking a boy's transition into manhood. It took place more than 70 years ago, but he recalled the details as if it happened yesterday. Tears were flowing down my cheeks, too. The following day, I called my father in New York and handed the cell phone to the oldest Jew in Cuba. This time there were no tears, just laughter. After the call, Salomon looked at my sneakers and said they're good shoes. He told me he's a European size 42, and I should bring him a pair when I return. He then asked me to send him a card on Hanukkah and smiled.

Conrad Smith touches down for one of his two tries in the All Blacks win. Fullback Mils Muliaina scored three tries in the first half, center Conrad Smith and winger Richard Kahui touched down twice and nine other players added their names to the New Zealand scoresheet as the All Blacks beat a weakened Samoan team by a record margin. New Zealand led 47-7, seven tries to one, at halftime and added eight tries, including a penalty try, in the second spell to surpass their highest score against Samoa. The All Blacks had a 26-0 lead after 16 minutes and set their record score against Samoa -- surpassing the 71-13 in 1999 -- despite being held scoreless for periods of 18 minutes in the first half and 10 minutes in the second. It was the fifth time New Zealand had reached 100 points in a match, with the All Blacks' record being the 145-17 win over Japan at the 1995 World Cup. Samoa was forced to pick a severely under-strength side because many of its leading and most-experienced players are involved with European club sides. Most of the players who took the field Wednesday were young and Samoa-based and playing against the All Blacks for the first time. Although outgunned by an All Blacks team which overwhelmingly controlled territory and possession, Samoa played with great spirit and scored a try in each half. Flyhalf Uale Mai scored and converted his own try after 28 minutes and flanker Alafoti Faosiliva touched down off a break by Uale Mai four minutes before fulltime. \"What can you say? 100 points,\" Samoa captain Filipo Levi said. \"It shows the All Blacks are on fire at the moment. They've showed in the Tri-Nations competition that they're a very consistent team. \"For some of our boys it was a big step up from playing club rugby in Samoa but, having said that, it was a big learning curve.\" Flyhalf Daniel Carter converted six of the All Blacks' first-half tries, surpassing 2,000 points in first-class rugby, and his replacement Stephen Donald scored his first Test try and converted seven of New Zealand's eight second-half tries. The match was scheduled to help the All Blacks bridge the three-week gap between their most recent Tri-Nations clash with South Africa and their next, against Australia, at Brisbane on September 13. The Brisbane match will decide the outcome of the Tri-Nations tournament. Copyright 2008 CNN. All rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Ex-Army scientist Bruce Ivins, seen here in 2003, died from an apparent suicide last week. But the case will not be considered closed, because administrative details remain incomplete, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing. Before making the information public, the FBI is expected to share the evidence of Ivins' involvement with survivors and relatives of victims in the anthrax attacks, the source said. A lawyer for Maureen Stevens, the widow of Bob Stevens, the first victim of the 2001 attacks, said she was invited to the session and will attend. The tabloid photo editor died after inhaling anthrax that investigators believe was in a letter sent to American Media Inc., the publisher of the Sun and National Enquirer tabloids, at its offices in Boca Raton, Florida. Another source familiar with the investigation said Tuesday that in the fall of 2001, Ivins borrowed a machine that can convert wet anthrax, the kind used at Fort Detrick, into dry powder, which was found in the anthrax letters. Such machines, called lyophilizers, are not usually used at Fort Detrick, where Ivins worked, though they are easy to obtain. Experts said the report may have no significance. \"I wouldn't necessarily make the conclusion that, just because he had access to a lyophilizer and used a lyophilizer, that that provides a smoking gun, that he must be using this for sinister purposes,\" said Peter Hotez, chairman of microbiology at George Washington University in Washington. Richard Spertzel, a former biodefense scientist who worked with Ivins at the lab at Fort Detrick, said there was \"no way\" a lyophilizer could have created the fine anthrax spores used in the 2001 letters. Spertzel said a more advanced machine would have been needed, and that no one working at a U.S. government lab could have produced such high quality anthrax in secret. Ivins, who is expected to be blamed for the mailings of the toxin, which killed five people and sickened more than a dozen others -- died July 27 at a hospital in Frederick, Maryland, from an apparent suicide attempt two days earlier. No charges have been made public. He became a suspect after investigators found DNA evidence from the 2001 anthrax mailings on a flask used in his laboratory at the U.S. Army Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases, said a source who is familiar with the investigation but not authorized to speak publicly about the case. Ivins had worked for decades in the biodefense lab at Fort Detrick, where he was trying to develop a better vaccine against the toxin. The FBI had traced the anthrax used in the attacks to the lab by using a new technology, a U.S. official familiar with the investigation said. Authorities were looking at whether Ivins may have released anthrax to test a vaccine he was working on, another official said. Some of the anthrax-laced letters, written in crude block letters, included the words, \"Take penacilin (sic) now,\" according to photographs released by the FBI. Since Ivins' death, suspicions about his involvement in the anthrax attacks have surfaced alongside questions about his sanity. At the time of his death, the 62-year-old scientist was under a temporary restraining order sought by a social worker who had counseled him in private and group sessions. She accused him of having harassed, stalked and threatened her with violence. The woman told the court in her complaint that Ivins had been treated at a mental health facility. Steven Hatfill, another government scientist who was named by the Justice Department as a \"person of interest\" in the attacks, was never charged. He sued the department, which settled the case in June. The skepticism in scientific circles about the strength of the case against Ivins heightens the importance of the government's unveiling of its evidence against the scientist, a former prosecutor said. \"I think the public and the survivors of the anthrax attacks are entitled to see the evidence before the grand jury,\" said Andrew McBride. \"And if there was a draft indictment and they were ready to indict Mr. Ivins, they ought to see that as well.\" CNN Producer Kevin Bohn contributed to this story.", "544b165ad1d22a5dcbbab469a2aa7666c2868361": "(CNN) -- Oklahoma health officials said Friday they are searching for the source of a rare form of E. coli that has killed one person and sickened 116 others in the northeastern part of the state. The subtype of bacteria -- called E. coli 0111 -- is \"not normally found in this form of outbreak,\" said Leslea Bennett-Webb, director of communication for the Oklahoma State Department of Health. More than 50 people have been hospitalized and nine people -- six of them children -- have been placed on dialysis, she said. She said the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, helped state officials determine the subtype, but said the cause of the outbreak remains unknown. \"The focus has been narrowed to the Country Cottage Restaurant located in Locust Grove,\" she said, noting that most of the people who became ill ate there between August 15 and August 23. Tests carried out on water from a well on restaurant property indicate the presence of bacteria, but \"we have not been able to confirm what kind of bacteria,\" said Skylar McElhaney, a spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality. The Oklahoma Department of Health will analyze them and compare them with samples taken from victims, she said. \"We can't say for sure that it is tied to the water in any way, but we also cannot rule it out,\" she said. Symptoms of infection with the bacteria can include severe diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, vomiting and severe abdominal cramping, said Larry Weatherford of the Oklahoma State Department of Health. Management at the restaurant, which has closed during the investigation, was working closely with health officials, he added. Meanwhile, the outbreak appears to be abating. \"While we believe we are seeing a downward curve in the number of people who have become ill, we still have many challenges with some patients who remain hospitalized,\" said State Epidemiologist Dr. Kristy Bradley. \"We continue to ask the public to be extra diligent in their hand washing and food preparation to minimize the possibility of additional persons becoming ill.\" The CDC estimates there may be about 70,000 E. coli infections each year in the United States.", "2577ef64a22c06cf63cb244abfad9ecc46603208": "NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- As Hurricane Gustav neared Louisiana's coast Monday morning, forecasters warned that the storm could stall over Louisiana and northeast Texas for several days, which would \"exacerbate the threat of heavy rains and inland flooding.\" Water from a canal in New Orleans, Louisiana, floods a road as Hurricane Gustav makes landfall Monday.

Prachanda is still the supreme commander of the Maoists People's Liberation Army. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as Prachanda, was elected four months after elections in which his Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) became the largest party in the 601-member constituent assembly. Prachanda received 464 votes of the 577 votes cast, while his rival Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress party received 113 votes. Most of the parties in the assembly voted for the Maoist candidate. A simple majority was enough to be elected the prime minister. Prachanda's victory became certain on Thursday when the third and fourth biggest parties in Nepal's assembly decided to back him. He will now lead a coalition government, although talks are ongoing on about the allocation of ministerial portfolios. The Maoists signed a peace deal with the government in November 2006, joined an interim parliament and government in 2007 and fought multi-party elections in April this year.

Saturday morning, Gustav was about 255 miles east-southeast of the western tip of Cuba. Gustav, a Category 4 storm with 135 mph (220 km/hr) top winds, was centered 485 miles (780 kilometers) southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River, according to the National Hurricane Center's  6 a.m. GMT (2 a.m. ET) advisory. That's only 15 mph slower than when the storm first crossed land in Cuba. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the storm could pick up even more strength as it enters the gulf's warmer waters. The Hurricane Center said Gustav is an \"extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane.\" In the United States, state and federal officials -- eager to prove they are ready -- urged residents to flee, and many of those residents obeyed, moving north by the tens of thousands, according to the governor of Louisiana, whose state was hit three years ago by Hurricane Katrina. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin called Gustav \"the mother of all storms,\" saying its destruction could outstrip that from Katrina, which flooded much of his city and killed about 3,000 people. A hurricane watch remained in effect for the northern Gulf Coast from east of High Island Texas eastward to the Alabama-Florida border, including the city of New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain, the National Hurricane Center said.

Anticipating the storm, about 10,000 Cubans evacuated Saturday to Cuba's mainland from La Isla de Juventud, or Isle of Youth, a province south of the nation's western end. The hurricane center said western Cuba could receive as much as 25 inches of rain. Residents sought refuge with family or friends, or went to a government shelter, CNN's Morgan Neill said. Cubans also headed to higher ground on the mainland, with many utilizing horse-drawn carriages and vintage cars. President Ra\u00fal Castro checked with the island's officials Saturday to be sure preparations were on track, Neill said.

The hurricane center's five-day forecast places a landfall anywhere from Galveston, Texas, east to Mobile, Alabama. New Orleans, Louisiana, is at the center of the projected path. A hurricane watch remained in effect for the northern Gulf Coast from east of High Island, Texas, to the Alabama-Florida border, including the city of New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain, the National Hurricane Center said. A watch means hurricane conditions are possible within the specified area, generally within 36 hours. The Gulf Coast is still recovering from Hurricane Katrina, which killed more than 1,800 people when it slammed ashore August 29, 2005. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour said Hurricane Katrina victims living in government-issued trailers or mobile homes along his state's coast will begin evacuating this weekend. Gustav is the second major hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season.

California Sen. Barbara Boxer has said the EPA is becoming a \"secretive, dangerous ally of polluters.\" \"Please do not respond to questions or make any statements,\" the June 16 e-mail said, advising staff to direct questioners to senior staff members cleared to answer questions from outside the agency. Robbi Farrell, chief of staff of the EPA's compliance assurance division, sent the e-mail to 11 managers in the department. The e-mail was posted on a Web site of the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. The group, an alliance of state and federal environmental professionals, labeled the communication a \"gag order.\" \"The order reinforces a growing bunker mentality within an EPA that is the subject of a growing number of probes into political interference with agency operations,\" the group said. EPA press director Roxanne Smith rejected that characterization, saying the e-mail was about efficiency, not secrecy. The memo was a response to a May 2007 audit by the Inspector General's Office that found the EPA did not respond earlier to IG reports on problems with water enforcement and other issues, The Associated Press reported. The audit, however, did not make any recommendations governing communication between staff and the Inspector General's Office. \"A senior staffer in the enforcement office sent out an e-mail to simply help her office efficiently respond to requests from the press, GAO and EPA's inspector general,\" Smith told CNN. \"There is nothing in the procedure that restricts conversation between enforcement staff, the press, GAO and the IG,\" she said, adding it is \"consistent with existing agency polices.\" Smith is one of the people to whom recipients of the memo were told to direct journalists' questions. In a written statement, the EPA's Office of Inspector General said it did not approve the language of Robbi's warning and advised, \"All EPA officials and employees are required to cooperate\" with the office. \"This cooperation includes providing the OIG full and unrestricted access to EPA documents, records, and personnel,\" the statement read. \"We are currently engaged in discussions with OECA [Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance] to assure that OIG and OECA interpretations are consistent in this matter.\" And Sen.

Hola! magazine, the Spanish sister publication to Hello!, has also published images of the Jolie-Pitt twins. Hello! magazine, which won international rights to the images, and People magazine, which took U.S. rights, published the photographs in their latest editions, which hit newsstands Monday. The two publications, which have previously secured image rights to the couple's elder children, are believed to have shared the costs, The Associated Press reported over the weekend.  The agency quoted an unnamed source, not authorized to speak about the deal, as saying the pictures had fetched $14 million. The images show the couple, newborns Knox Leon and Vivienne Marcheline and the rest of the Jolie-Pitt family -- Maddox, 7, Pax, 4, Zahara, 3, and Shiloh, 2. The twins were born by Cesarian section at the Lenval hospital in the French Riviera resort of Nice on July 12. Hello! magazine, which heralds its coverage as the \"biggest exclusive of the year,\" devotes 17 pages of coverage to the twins' arrival. In an interview published in the magazine, Jolie says: \"Wanting a big family is one of the things that brought Brad and I together.\" Pitt adds: \"When Ange and I were told we were having twins we burst into hysterics... We didn't see this one coming.\"  Watch why the photos went for so much money \u00bb . Larry Hackett, the managing editor of People said that it was \"thrilled\" to have carried the images. People, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.

President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner says she doesn't like to \"condemn someone who has an addiction.\" \"I don't like it when people easily condemn someone who has an addiction as if he were a criminal, as if he were a person who should be persecuted,\" she told a meeting of the National Investigation into the Consumption of Alcohol, Tobacco, Psychopharmaceuticals and Illegal Drugs. \"Those who should be persecuted are those who sell the substances, those who give it away, those who traffic in it.\" A poll shows 2 percent of Argentines have tried cocaine, but some people believe decriminalization of drugs could result in wider drug use. Regardless, the Argentine government is pushing Congress to pass the decriminalization legislation by the end of the year. \"Decriminalization of the consumer should include what are called second-generation human rights, but at the same time there should be a strong policy of prevention, so that no one falls in the situation of consuming any substance,\" said Anibal Fernandez, the minister of security and justice. Ethan Nadelmann, founder and executive director of the New York-based Drug Policy Alliance, said such policies have been adopted throughout Europe and other parts of Latin America. \"The evidence generally shows that the decriminalization of possession is not clearly associated with any increase in illicit drug use,\" he said. A few years ago, then-Mexican President Vicente Fox proposed decriminalizing possession of drugs combined with a crackdown on traffickers, but a harsh reaction from the Bush administration caused him to retreat, Nadelmann said. Brazil and Colombia have passed laws decriminalizing drug use in an effort to combat the spread of HIV among injecting drug users, he said. Politicians recognize that \"you basically need to get those people out of the underground and into health systems,\" Nadelmann said. \"This would be part of a growing number of countries in Latin America where there is, either for political or judicial reasons, a push toward decriminalization of personal possession, sometimes combined with initiatives to crack down harder on bigger drug traffickers,\" he said. \"It typically involves both lessening the criminal sanction for possession of cannabis while also providing for alternatives to incarceration for people addicted to drugs who are arrested for drug possession or other minor offenses.\" The concept has gained followers in the United States, too, he said, citing statistics that show two-thirds of Americans support drug treatment instead of jail time for first-time drug offenders. On Wednesday, Rep. Barney Frank announced a proposal to end federal penalties for Americans carrying fewer than 100 grams, or almost a quarter-pound, of marijuana. \"The vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the government's business,\" Frank said on Capitol Hill. \"I don't think it is the government's business to tell you how to spend your leisure time.\" CNN's Javier Doberti contributed to this story.", "70f210b63211c32ab22354506b7bd9b80ee194af": "DONETSK, Ukraine (CNN) -- A frail Irene Famulak clutched her brother on the airport tarmac, her arm wrapped around him in a tight embrace, tears streaming down their faces. It was the first time since 1942 they had seen each other, when she was 17 and he was just 7. Siblings Wssewolod Galezkij and Irene Famulak were separated in 1942 when Nazis took her to a labor camp. That was the night the invading Nazis came to take her away from her Ukrainian home. \"I remember it well because I kissed him good-bye, and he pushed me away,\" she said of her brother. \"I asked, 'Why did you do that?' And he said that he doesn't like kisses.\" \"The Nazis told my mother that I was being taken to work in a German labor camp for six months. But it was, of course, much longer. I was there for years.\" Both siblings survived the Holocaust and grew up on different sides of the Iron Curtain, not knowing the fate of the other. But after 66 years apart, Famulak, 83, was reunited with her long lost 73-year-old brother, Wssewolod Galezkij. They held each other close this time, cherishing the moment.  Watch siblings hug for first time in seven decades \u00bb . \"I don't believe anyone has ever known such happiness. Now, I truly believe I can die satisfied,\" Galezkij said. Famulak made the long journey to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, after being contacted by the American Red Cross. The organization told her they had located her only surviving sibling. Famulak said she spent World War II in a labor camp in Munich, Germany, working in the kitchens. She had been taken to the camp with her older sister. When it was liberated in 1945, Famulak stayed in Germany for several years, eventually emigrating to the United States in 1956. She never saw her parents again after that day in 1942 when Nazis separated her from her family. She and her brother still have no idea what happened to their mother and father. Some of their siblings lived through the war, but later died; others, they never heard from again after being separated. But her younger brother never gave up hope of tracking his sister down. He, too, was sent to a German labor camp, but after the war, he moved back to Ukraine, then a republic of the Soviet Union.  See photos of the \"needle in haystack\" reunion \u00bb . Under Soviet leader Josef Stalin, information on lost relatives was kept sealed, and Galezkij said it wasn't until reforms in the late 1980s, followed by the Soviet collapse, that he started making progress in finding his sister. Even then, it took him more than 17 years to locate her in the United States. He broke down in tears as he spoke of his overwhelming happiness at finding her. \"When the Red Cross told me they had found her in America, it was such a joy,\" he said, sobbing. In fact, he had to be taken to the hospital because he was so overcome when he first learned she was alive. At this week's reunion, there was a doctor on hand at the airport as a precaution. Back in the United States, there were tears, too. Linda Klein, the director of the American Red Cross Holocaust and War Victims Tracing Center, said the volunteer who helped the siblings find each other got caught up in the emotion herself. \"When I showed her the picture, she stood there and wept,\" Klein said. \"She was beside herself.\" Klein's group has reunited 1,500 families since it began work in 1990. She said the former Soviet Union released records in 1989 of concentration camps it liberated, greatly helping organizers find information on Holocaust victims. The organization has 100 volunteers -- a third of them Holocaust survivors, Klein said. The group also helps families find information about their loved ones who died during the Holocaust. They have brought together more than 50 families this year. All of their work is free. She says it's often like \"looking for a needle in a haystack.\" \"We're playing beat the clock right now,\" she said, adding, \"It's about families that one day they were together and then they were apart.\" \"When a connection is made, there are just smiles all around.\" That was the case for this family in Ukraine. Years of trauma, of separation, of not knowing what happened to loved ones, have been replaced by celebration. In a picturesque orchard overlooking rolling fields, Galezkij, his wife and their neighbors laid out a feast for his American sister. As the vodka flowed, he told her how he had survived for a lifetime without her. \"He says he always thought he'd see me someday. He dreamt lots about me,\" Famulak said, as she sat next to her brother. \"And he wrote a song for me. When he went to sleep, he sang every night and cried.\" With that, Galezkij, weakened by illness and age, burst into song. But this time, he sang the words with pure joy.

A convicted Iranian drug dealer is hanged from a crane in the southern city of Shiraz in September. Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency reported earlier that 30 people would be put to death. It was not immediately clear if the last person's life was spared. The Iranian judiciary's statement said that all 30 were convicted of various crimes, which included: murder, murder in commission of a crime, disturbing public safety and security, being a public nuisance while drunk and being involved in illegal relationships -- relationships between men and women who are not married to each other. Kidnapping and using weapons while committing a crime were also among the charges. The statement also said that 20 of the convicts were convicted of drug and alcohol dealing, armed robbery and smuggling arms. The judiciary statement said that the convicts had their cases tried by the highest judicial authorities and were found guilty of the charges brought against them. The verdicts were final with their sentences carried out on Sunday. The judiciary said the hangings should serve as a warning to those who are contemplating committing such crimes, the agency reported. The statement also said that several other individuals are currently awaiting trial and their sentences will be carried out as soon as the verdicts are pronounced by the courts. According to Amnesty International, Iran executed 317 people last year, second only to China's 470. Iran's government launched a campaign March 20 to increase public security and bring the crime rate down. Police cracked down on alleged drug dealers, whom they called criminal gang members, and alleged habitual criminals who use guns in the commission of their crime. Alleged weapons smugglers and people who break social and religious laws, including adulterers, were also targets.

President Pervez Musharraf took control of Pakistan in a military coup in 1999. \"The coalition reaffirmed the resolve of democracy and democratic forces will work jointly to make a transition to genuine democracy,\" the head of Pakistan People's Party Asif Ali Zardari said, reading a joint communique with his coalition partners. Before pursuing impeachment proceedings, Pakistani lawmakers will demand Musharraf take a vote of confidence in the newly elected parliament, which he had vowed to do last year, Zardari said. \"The people of Pakistan gave a clear mandate in favor of democracy and democratic forces and voted for the change to oust Gen. Musharraf by defeating his ... party,\" Zardari added. \"In spite of his clear commitment that if his party was defeated in the election he would resign, he continues to cling to the office of the president.\"  Watch an expert talk about the impact of a possible impeachment \u00bb . If Musharraf does not request a vote of confidence, the National Assembly will meet on Monday to consider impeachment proceedings, PPP spokesman Capt. Wasif Syed told CNN. Speaking a short time before Thursday's announcement, Syed said there are enough votes in parliament right now to impeach the president. But Musharraf may still have one card up his sleeve: he could move to dissolve parliament and dismiss the prime minister. Amid the political upheaval, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani will replace Musharraf at the opening ceremony of the Olympics on Friday in Beijing, Pakistan's state-run news agency reported. Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 bloodless military coup, has seen his power erode significantly since he stepped down as the country's military ruler last year and since the opposition parties' victory in February's parliamentary elections. The new civilian government is under a lot of pressure to control Taliban and al Qaeda militants in its tribal region along the Afghan border. The CIA recently accused Pakistan's intelligence service of providing support for the militants who bombed India's embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan last month. Fighting on Thursday between Pakistani paramilitary troops and Taliban forces killed 25 Taliban and five soldiers along the Afghan border, an army spokesman told CNN. Asked about the situation, Dr. Ishtiaq Ahmad -- an Islamabad-based political analyst -- told CNN on Wednesday that he believes Musharraf \"will fight back\" against any attempt to remove him from power. \"Before they impeach the president, he might pre-empt them by using article 58(2b),\" he said, referring to the constitutional article that gives the president power to dissolve parliament and dismiss the prime minister. Ahmad, a professor of international relations at Islamabad's Quaid-i-Azam University, said any attempt to remove Musharraf would be a \"next to an impossible task\" because the president still has support. \"The army doesn't want him to be eliminated. The Americans are still favoring him,\" he noted.

Barack Obama's plane had to make an unscheduled landing on July 7 in St. Louis, Missouri. On July 7 the Midwest Airlines MD-81 made an unscheduled landing during the flight from Chicago, Illinois, to Charlotte, North Carolina. The owner of the plane initially said the landing was not caused by an emergency. However the tapes, released to ABC News through a Freedom of Information Act request, contradict that report. ABC first reported on the tapes on Thursday. Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Laura Brown told CNN Thursday evening that preliminary information for incidents is often incomplete or incorrect.  Watch what the tapes revealed \u00bb . According to the tapes, the pilot told an FAA air traffic controller that he had limited ability to move the plane's nose up and down. \"We have limited pitch authority at flight levels; we're descending to see if we can regain pitch authority,\" the pilot told the air traffic controller. \"At this time we would like to declare this an emergency and also have CFR (fire and rescue equipment) standing by in St. Louis,\" the pilot said. The pilot remained calm throughout the recording. Midwest Airlines acknowledged at the time that the pilot had detected a control problem in the pitch of the plane after an emergency evacuation chute opened in the aircraft's tail cone while in flight. Normally, the chute deploys only after landing and after the tail cone pops off. The pitch, or angle of the nose of an airplane, affects the pilot's ability to control the plane. The airline said the pilot had \"full authority of the aircraft.\" According to the tapes, the pilot said he regained control as the plane began to descend into St. Louis. \"We had a pitch authority problem, now that we have come down to a lower altitude it seems to have rectified itself. We do have pitch control of the aircraft at this time,\" he said. Fire trucks met the aircraft when it landed at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. After the plane landed, Obama told reporters the plane landed because of a mechanical problem and noted it marked the first time he had had to do so. \"Just thought we'd spice things up a little bit today,\" he joked. \"Anytime a pilot says that something's not working the way its supposed to, then, you know, you make sure you tighten your seat belt. Everything seemed under control, the pilots knew what they were doing.\" The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident, said last month that there was no evidence of tampering. An \"examination of the hardware did not reveal any evidence of missing components, nor any evidence of tampering,\" the board said.

Protesters demonstrate against an anti-Islamic film in front of the Dutch embassy in Jakarta. The protesters tore off the gate of the embassy in the city of Medan and ripped down a flag, said Dutch Embassy spokeswoman Gonneke de Ridder. Local television carried pictures of police dispersing and rounding up demonstrators. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim nation. The 15-minute film, \"Fitna,\" features disturbing images of terrorist acts juxtaposed over verses from the Quran to paint Islam as a threat to Western society. It has been posted on several Web sites, including Google Video and YouTube. Dutch Prime Minister Jan Beter Balkanende has said his government worried that Geert Wilders' film could provoke a violent backlash. The film has prompted protests in other parts of the Muslim world. Soon after its release last month, hundreds of angry Muslims rallied in Pakistan, where the government temporarily blocked access of YouTube over a trailer for Wilders' film. The protesters burned the Dutch flag and called on Pakistan to cut ties with the Netherlands. The Dutch government and others, including the European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, have rejected the film. The OIC has 57 member states over four continents and claims on its Web site to be the second largest inter-governmental organization, after the United Nations. In its statement, it urged the international community to condemn the showing of the film and asked the Dutch government to prosecute the author of the documentary under Dutch law. Wilders has stood by his project. \"My intention was not to offend in any way, but to show the truth -- at least the truth as I see it,\" Wilders told CNN. \"And if the truth hurts and could be offensive, well, this of course is not my problem.\" Wilders is a member of the Dutch parliament from the conservative Party for Freedom and an outspoken critic of Islam. He said he has \"big problems\" with Islam's Prophet Mohammed, the Quran and \"everything that is stated inside this terrible book.\" The title, \"Fitna,\" translates in Arabic to \"strife\" or \"conflict\" of the type that occurs within families or any other homogenous group. The film opens with passages from the Quran, interspersed with graphic images of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States . The video also includes disturbing images of other terror attacks -- bloodied victims; beheadings of hostages; executions of women in hijab, the traditional Muslim attire; and footage, with subtitles, of Islamic leaders preaching inflammatory sermons against Jews and Christians.

During a campaign event in Columbia, Missouri, Biden did not mention his Republican counterpart by name but said, \"I hear all this talk about how the Republicans are going to work in dealing with parents who have both the joy ... and the difficulty of raising a child who has a developmental disability, who were born with a birth defect.\" Biden's support of stem cell research is at odds with the position taken by the Republicans' vice presidential nominee, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, whose 5-month-old son, Trig, has Down syndrome. Palin, an evangelical Christian, opposes stem cell research because it involves the use of human embryos, but her running mate, GOP presidential nominee McCain, does support stem cell research. \"Well, guess what, folks? If you care about it, why don't you support stem cell research?\" asked Biden, the running mate of Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama. Those comments brought a sharp response. \"Barack Obama's running mate sunk to a new low today, launching an offensive debate over who cares more about special needs children,\" McCain-Palin spokesman Ben Porritt said. \"Playing politics with this issue is disturbing and indicative of a desperate campaign.\" Biden spokesman David Wade insisted that the Delaware senator's comments were not directed at Palin. \"This is a clash of policies, not a clash of personalities,\" Wade said. \"We've heard not a dime's worth of difference between the McCain-Palin ticket and the Bush administration on medical breakthroughs that millions of parents and doctors believe could save lives and transform the quality of life for countless Americans.\" During her acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention last week, Palin told parents of children with disabilities that she would be \"a friend and advocate in the White House.\" But the Alaska governor's support for the disabled has come under scrutiny since McCain chose Palin to be his running mate nearly two weeks ago. Before her run for the vice presidency, advocacy for special needs programs had not been a central part of her political campaigns or during her administration, despite her sister's autistic son.  Watch more on Palin's budget priorities \u00bb . Palin signed a bill this year increasing special needs funding but frustrated some of the bill's co-sponsors by stepping in only at the last minute. Sonya Kerr, an Anchorage attorney specializing in disability rights, filed a lawsuit against the state and Palin, alleging that there are not enough services for kids with special needs, specifically a child with autism. \"I would say, welcome, Gov. Palin, to our reality and what we've been trying to deal with for a long time,\" Kerr said. \"I hope that it means that there will be support on a bipartisan basis for what people with disabilities need so we are not a bargaining chip in the political process.\" CNN's Deb Feyerick, Alexander Mooney and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report.", "c676027eea6109621206e3864c4eea30912fe09f": "BROWNSVILLE, Texas (CNN)  -- Hurricane Dolly weakened to a tropical storm Wednesday night after it made landfall on South Padre Island, Texas, leaving a trail of battered buildings and flooding. Police patrol the streets of South Padre Island, Texas, on Wednesday as Hurricane Dolly approaches. By 9 p.m. CT, Dolly's sustained winds had dipped to about 70 mph with higher gusts, according to the National Hurricane Center. A Category 1 hurricane has winds of at least 75 mph. A tropical storm warning remained in effect from Brownsville to Port Aransas, Texas. Tropical storm warnings for other areas were lifted. The eye of the storm made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane on South Padre Island, Texas, about 1 p.m. CT, tearing roofs off homes, flooding streets and sending residents scrambling for safety from wind gusts reaching 120 mph. By 2 p.m., the hurricane was downgraded to Category 1, but in many areas along the southwest coastal region, the damage was already done.  Watch CNN's Gary Tuchman brace against Dolly's high winds \u00bb . At least one person was injured as sustained winds up to 100 mph downed power lines and tore observation decks off homes and condos, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. A 17-year-old fell from a seventh-story balcony, sustaining head injuries, a broken leg and a broken hip. He is alert and receiving treatment on the island while authorities wait for the first opportunity to get him to the mainland, KPRC reported. \"When we heard the first bang, I thought it was one of the air conditioners flying,\" said Jacqueline Bell, who lives on South Padre Island. \"Then we went outside, and we saw the debris, and we saw the neighbors leaving.\" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said persistent rainfall could cause flooding upstream in the Rio Grande as long as the storm stalled over the mountains of Mexico.  Watch Myers explain the threat of flooding upriver \u00bb . Myers said it could take two days for the rainwater to flow upstream and challenge the natural levees, which were holding for now. \"The levees are holding up just fine,\" said Johnny Cavazos, emergency coordinator for Cameron County, The Associated Press reported. \"There is no indication right now that they are going to crest.\" Even before Dolly made landfall, driving rain and wind gusts from its outer rings flooded streets and threatened to pour into homes while wind gusts shattered windows on the island popular with tourists. The 2,400 residents began bracing for the storm Tuesday night, when strong winds forced the closure of South Padre Island's causeway to the mainland. Officials said the causeway is closed any time winds reach 39 mph. Some chose to remain on the island and wait out the storm. Steven Murphy took shelter with his girlfriend in his 65-foot double-decker fishing boat, Murphy's Law, and hoped for the best. Read about why Murphy decided to wait out the storm . Murphy, who owns a charter fishing company with his brother on the island, lived through a more powerful hurricane, where he saw boats bigger than his tossed onto land. \"I had nightmares about that last night,\" he said from his boat Wednesday. He said the wind outside sounded like a tornado and added that he'd seen several items blow past the windows of his vessel. \"It's starting to tear it up real good,\" Murphy said.  See images and videos from affected areas \u00bb . On the mainland, people in the path of the storm stacked sandbags around their homes, nailed plywood over windows and prepared generators to keep power going in the event of a blackout.  iReport.com: Are you in Dolly's path? Brownsville Mayor Pat Ahumada said that the storm downed trees and dumped 6 to 8 inches of rain but that emergency workers were ready to respond once the wind and rain died down. Ahumada said reports that the city's levees are in danger of breaching were exaggerated.  Watch Mayor Ahumada explain the situation on the ground \u00bb . He said it would take 20 inches of rain to top nearly all of the city's levees, which had been reinforced to federal standards or above. \"People think we're facing a Katrina,\" he said. \"That's not the case.\" More than 13,000 customers were without power in Cameron County, where Brownsville is, utility company AEP Texas told The Associated Press. Dolly's arrival also had the military scrambling. The Navy moved 89 aircraft from its Corpus Christi post to other locations in Texas and New Mexico.  See Dolly's projected path \u00bb . Texas Gov. Rick Perry issued a disaster declaration for 14 counties before Dolly arrived. The declaration \"allows the state to initiate necessary preparedness efforts,\" according to a statement from Perry's office. More than two dozen state agencies and organizations, including the Red Cross, are on standby to help with evacuations and other needs. The National Guard has set up staging areas in Houston, Austin and San Antonio, officials said. As many as 1,200 National Guardsmen have been called to help, and 700 are deployed to targeted areas.

Jailed polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs, seen in September, has been hospitalized in Las Vegas. Authorities took Jeffs from an Arizona jail to a Nevada hospital on Tuesday after he saying he looked feverish and was \"acting in a convulsive manner, and looked in a very weakened state.\" Doctors there determined he should go to a larger facility, so Jeffs was flown to the Sunrise Medical Center in Las Vegas. Sheriff Tom Sheahan of Mohave County, Arizona said before Jeffs' release that his condition was not believed to be life-threatening. Further details about his release on Wednesday were unavailable. Sheahan said he is trying to get information about Jeffs' condition.  Watch how authorities are mum about Jeffs \u00bb . Jeffs' attorney in Arizona, Michael Piccarreta, also declined comment on his client's hospitalization. The 52-year-old is the leader and so-called prophet of the estimated 10,000-member Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an offshoot of the mainstream Mormon church. The FLDS openly practices polygamy at its Yearning for Zion Ranch outside Eldorado, Texas, along with two towns straddling the Utah-Arizona state line -- Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. The charges against Jeffs are Class 6 felonies under Arizona law, Piccarreta said, meaning that a judge -- upon conviction -- will determine whether the charges are misdemeanors or felonies. Other charges Jeffs initially faced in Arizona have been dismissed, said Piccarreta. In November, Jeffs was sentenced in Utah to two consecutive terms of five years to life in prison after his conviction on two charges of being an accomplice to rape in connection with a 2001 marriage he performed between a girl, 14, and her cousin, 19. According to unsealed court documents, Jeffs refused food and drink for a month in January 2007 and developed ulcers on his knees from kneeling in prayer for hours as he awaited trial. On January 28, 2007, he attempted to hang himself in his cell, the documents said. In the days afterward while on suicide watch, Jeffs on separate occasions banged his head and threw himself against a wall. He has been in custody since August 2006, when he was arrested during a routine traffic stop after spending months on the FBI's 10 most-wanted fugitives list. In April, authorities removed more than 400 children from the YFZ Ranch. Child protection officials said they found a \"pervasive pattern\" of sexual abuse on the ranch through forced marriages between underage girls and older men. In June, however, the Texas Supreme Court ruled the state had no right to remove the children. The court also said the state lacked evidence to show that the children faced imminent danger of abuse. The children were returned to their families.

Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick has agreed to resign from office, a prosecutor said Thursday. \"The city is much better shape than the city I received seven years ago,\" said Kilpatrick. \"We in Detroit have done amazing things together.\" During the speech Kilpatrick also jabbed city officials and Michigan's governor, telling them to continue to work for the people of Detroit as hard as they did to get him out of office. Kilpatrick told the crowd his marriage is better than it has ever been and kissed his wife to end the speech, an act that brought thunderous applause. Kilpatrick said he decided to step down so the city could continue to move forward. \"Sometimes standing strong means stepping down,\" Kilpatrick said. \"But Detroit you have set me up for a comeback.\" The embattled Kilpatrick pleaded guilty Thursday to charges resulting from a sex scandal and submitted his resignation to the governor -- effective in two weeks. Under a plea deal, Kilpatrick will serve four months in the Wayne County Jail and the rest of his five-year sentence on probation, said Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy. He will enter jail on the day of his formal sentencing, October 28, she said. Kilpatrick, 38, also agreed not to run for public office during his probation, to pay $1 million in restitution and to forfeit any future pension. He was accused of blocking a criminal investigation into his office and firing a police deputy to cover up an extramarital affair and other possible illicit activities. After the deputy, Gary Brown, lost his job, a mayoral bodyguard, Officer Harold Nelthrope, left his job voluntarily when the atmosphere became too tense, said his attorney in the whistle-blower suit trial. Walt Harris, another former mayoral bodyguard, filed his own whistle-blower suit, contending he was punished for supporting Nelthrope's reports of wrongdoing by Kilpatrick and his bodyguards. The city of Detroit paid $8.4 million to settle the lawsuits, but legal fees have pushed that figure to at least $9 million. Prompted by the judge to recount his wrongdoing, Kilpatrick admitted Thursday, \"I lied under oath in the case of Gary Brown and Harold Nelthrope versus the city of Detroit. ... I did so with the intent to mislead the court and the jury and to impede and obstruct the fair administration of justice.\"  Watch Kilpatrick in court \u00bb . When Circuit Court Judge David Groner asked Kilpatrick if he understood that by pleading guilty he was giving up the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, the mayor said, \"I think I gave that up a long time ago, your honor. Yes.\" Kilpatrick had faced eight felony counts. As part of the agreement, six counts related to misconduct in office were dropped, and a perjury count was changed to a second obstruction of justice charge. In a separate case against Kilpatrick, Groner on Thursday accepted a no-contest plea on an assault charge brought against the mayor in July after he allegedly shoved a police officer trying to serve a subpoena on a friend of Kilpatrick's who was a potential witness in his perjury case. Groner set an October 28 sentencing date for both cases. Also Thursday, Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm adjourned a hearing on whether to remove Kilpatrick from office after he notified her of his pending resignation. \"Today, this sad but historic story is coming to an end,\" Granholm said. \"It's very important for us as a state and as a city to turn this page together. There is much work to do. It is my profound hope that we can now write a new history for this great but embattled city.\"  Watch Granholm call for a new chapter \u00bb . The governor set the hearing after the Detroit City Council voted in May to ask her to remove Kilpatrick, alleging he had misled the council by not revealing the affair when he urged it to approve settlements with the people who had filed the whistle-blower suits against the city. If Kilpatrick doesn't resign as promised, Granholm said the hearing would reconvene on September 22. The Detroit City Council president, who becomes mayor when Kilpatrick steps down September 18, vowed to make the transition as seamless as possible. Kilpatrick will be replaced in two weeks by City Council President Ken Cockrel Jr., who vowed Thursday to make the transition \"as seamless as possible.\"", "e8bbd5a77edf96611a4b8efcfbc625ec65985e98": "To celebrate our 20th year of publication, Cooking Light wanted to know what places best fit our philosophy to eat smart, be fit, and live well.

Bob Woodward's book, \"The War Within: Secret White House History 2006-2008,\" came out Monday. The program -- which Woodward compares to the World War II era Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb -- must remain secret for now or it would \"get people killed,\" Woodward said Monday on CNN's Larry King Live. \"It is a wonderful example of American ingenuity solving a problem in war, as we often have,\" Woodward said. In \"The War Within: Secret White House History 2006-2008,\" Woodward disclosed the existence of secret operational capabilities developed by the military to locate, target and kill leaders of al Qaeda in Iraq and other insurgent leaders. National security adviser Stephen Hadley, in a written statement reacting to Woodward's book, acknowledged the new strategy. Yet he disputed Woodward's conclusion that the \"surge\" of 30,000 U.S. troops into Iraq was not the primary reason for the decline in violent attacks. \"It was the surge that provided more resources and a security context to support newly developed techniques and operations,\" Hadley wrote. Woodward, associate editor of the Washington Post, wrote that along with the surge and the new covert tactics, two other factors helped reduce the violence. Watch Bob Woodward explain the strategy \u00bb . One was the decision of militant cleric Muqtada al-Sadr to order a cease-fire by his Mehdi Army. The other was the \"Anbar Awakening\" movement that saw Sunni tribes aligning with U.S. troops to battle al Qaeda in Iraq. Woodward told Larry King that while there is a debate over how much credit the new secret operations should get for the drop in violence, he concluded it \"accounts for a good portion.\" \"I would somewhat compare it to the Manhattan Project in World War II,\" he said \"It's a ski slope right down in a matter of months, cutting the violence in half. This isn't going to happen with the bunch of joint security stations or the surge.\" The top secret operations, he said, will \"some day in history ... be described to people's amazement.\" While he would not reveal the details, Woodward said the terrorists who have been targeted were already aware of the capabilities. \"The enemy has a heads up because they've been getting wiped out and a lot of them have been killed,\" he said. \"It's not news to them. \"If you were a member of al Qaeda or the resistance or some extremist militia, you would be wise to get your rear end out of town,\" Woodward said. \"It is very dangerous.\"", "d46e1849cbbf875ccd018fd778fa6c433cab4694": "(CNN) -- Musician Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy performed at a concert sponsored by Rock the Vote on the first night of the Democratic National Convention.

I mean, the U.S. subcontracted out an assassination program against al Qaeda way back in early 2006. And this was conceded by the then-chief of military intelligence in Baghdad and by [U.S.] Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad himself. That's what broke the back of al Qaeda. Then when America put 100,000-plus insurgents on the U.S. government payroll, including members of al Qaeda, that not only took them out of the field, but it also let them run their own assassination programs against the Iranian-backed militias. Roberts: So it sounds like assassination was a real part of the program here, but was that the only thing that worked? What about the addition of these troops and these neighborhood stations that were set up? Did it all kind of work together? Ware: It does work together. But the key to the downturn in violence that we're seeing now is not so much the surge of 30,000 troops in itself. What it's been is the segregation of Baghdad into these enclaves. It's been cutting a deal with Muqtada al-Sadr, the leader of the Iranian-backed militia. And primarily it's been putting your enemy on your payroll -- the Sunni insurgents and many members of al Qaeda. That's what's brought down the violence. This is your American militia, the counterbalance to the Iranian militias. So if there's new teams out there with new technology, great. But they're riding the wave of previous success.", "c4afe4db222c094c40bb3f271e37e006bcbebf88": "\"Everything can be improved.\" -- Ross Lovegrove . Designer Ross Lovegrove . Fiercely original and unapologetically innovative, Ross Lovegrove describes himself, somewhat reluctantly, as an industrial designer. \"It's not as grimy, it's not as deep and dark as that sounds,\" he says. Famous for his tactile and sensual fluid forms, he takes his inspiration from nature to create an organic minimalism that he calls \"fat free\" design. \"Nature is a very big part of my work and always has been. I've never seen it as a trend or a fashion,\" he told CNN. In the early 1980s, with Frog Design in West Germany, he worked on projects including Sony Walkmans and Apple computers. He later moved to Paris as a consultant to Knoll International. Since returning to London in 1986, Lovegrove has worked with a wide range of clients including Airbus Industries, Peugeot, Apple Computers, Issey Miyake, Olympus Cameras, Tag Heuer, Herman Miller, Japan Airlines and Toyo Ito Architects in Japan, as well as a host of top design brands.  See some of Ross Lovegrove's designs. \u00bb . Away from his client work, one of Lovegrove's projects is the \"Car on a Stick,\" an electric bubble car that turns into an elevated streetlight at night. \"I'm interested in developing an aesthetic for the 21st century which comes from the intelligent use of resources, materials and structures,\" he says. Lovegrove's methods blend organic inspiration, a fresh approach to function, cutting-edge manufacturing technologies and cross-application of techniques. \"In my own work, I'll learn from doing a super-lightweight suitcase in Osaka,\" he says. \"Then I'll think, 'How can I use that super-lightweight technology to do the chassis of a car?' It's transfer and exchange of knowledge.\" His work has been extensively published and exhibited internationally and is held in permanent collections of various design museums around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York (MOMA), the Design Museum in London and the Vitra Design Museum Weil Am Rhein, Basel, Switzerland. ..........................

Randy Pausch emphasized the joy of life in his \"last lecture,\" originally given in September 2007. Pausch, 47, a computer science professor, delivered the lecture, \"Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams,\" at Carnegie Mellon in September 2007, a month after being told he had three to six months to live because his cancer had returned. The lanky, energetic Pausch talked about goals he had accomplished, like experiencing zero gravity and creating Disney attractions, and those he had not, including becoming a professional football player. He used rejections he was handed when he applied for jobs at Disney to comment on the importance of persistence. \"The brick walls are there for a reason ... to show us how badly we want something,\" he said. \"Because the brick walls are there to stop the people who don't want it badly enough. They're there to stop the other people.\"  Watch what Pausch did for his wife \u00bb . Starting with a joke about \"a deathbed conversion\" -- \"I just bought a Macintosh\" computer -- the educator went on to say that one of his childhood dreams was to write an entry in the World Book Encyclopedia. \"I guess you can tell the nerds early,\"  he added. An expert in virtual reality, Pausch did go on to write an encyclopedia entry on the subject. He discussed his fondness for winning stuffed animals at fairs, showed a slide of them, then -- pretending to be concerned his audience would think the image had been digitally manipulated -- produced them onstage. Donning silly costume items like a vest with arrows sticking out of it and a Mad Hatter's hat, he described working with students as a way to help other people achieve their dreams. He also played down his own importance, saying that after he got a Ph.D., his mother took to introducing him as \"a doctor, but not the kind who helps people.\" The lecture has been viewed more than 3.2 million times since it was posted on YouTube in December. Pausch co-founded the university's Entertainment Technology Center and was known for developing interdisciplinary courses and research projects that attracted new students to the field of computer science. He also spent his career encouraging computer scientists to collaborate with artists, dramatists and designers, Carnegie Mellon said. The university's president, Jared Cohon, described Pausch as \"a brilliant researcher and gifted teacher.\" \"His love of teaching, his sense of fun and his brilliance came together in the Alice project, which teaches students computer programming while enabling them to do something fun -- making animated movies and games,\" Cohon added. \"Carnegie Mellon -- and the world -- are better places for having had Randy Pausch in them.\" Pausch describes Cohon urging him to talk about having fun in his lecture, and telling him it's difficult because it's like asking a fish to talk about water. \"I don't know how not to have fun,\" he said. \"I'm dying and I'm having fun. And I'm going to keep having fun every day I have left.\" Pausch is survived by his wife, Jai, and three children.", "065378e265a6d5ff38b2e6748ba66490cf8670a9": "(CNN Traveller) -- When the Roman Emperor Hadrian came to power in 117AD he inherited an empire that was overstretched militarily and creaking at the seams. A massive bust of Hadrian's head unearthed only last year is part of the exhibition at the British Museum. One of his first acts was to pull the troops out of Mesopotamia, modern-day Iraq, a fact that is sure to resonate with visitors to the British Museum\"s superb exhibition \"Hadrian: Empire and Conflict\" which opens on 24 July under the imposing classical dome of the Reading Room. Curator Torsten Opper says: \"No matter what our take is on the conflict in Iraq today, we can relate to Hadrian's decision. Maybe 10 or 15 years ago, it wouldn't have mattered so much. Now it does.\" Hadrian was born in Rome to a noble family whose origins lay in Spain. One of the greatest of Rome's emperors, he consolidated imperial power, was a patron of architecture and travelled extensively across his lands. Though married, he also took a homosexual lover, Antinous, whose drowning in the river Nile on the very day Egyptians were celebrating the death in a similar manner of the god Osiris remains one of ancient history's great unsolved mysteries. The range of exhibits and their rarity means that this exhibition is going to be extremely well-attended. Visitors will, for example, be the first members of the public anywhere to see a huge head of the emperor that was dug up recently at Sagalassos in central Turkey and would have once crowned a statue that was over five metres high. \"A year ago, this was still lying buried in the ground,\" says Opper. \"It\"s proof that Roman history isn't done and dusted; that we are still able to rethink the past and evaluate it.\" The exhibition brings together 180 objects, from 31 sources in 11 different countries. \"It hasn't been an easy thing to do,\" adds Opper. \"Many of these objects leave huge gaps in their home collection and many are extremely delicate. This isn't an exhibition that can travel. People will only be able to view it for these three months.\" Many of the most delicate objects are also those that give the most dramatic insight into Hadrian's reign. Between 132AD and 135/6AD the Jews of Judea rebelled against Roman rule. Some of the insurgents took refuge in a cave in the desert, called the cave of letters, in which they were trapped by Roman troops. Few made it out alive. The climatic conditions of the cave have preserved objects in astonishing condition. There is a letter written by Jewish leader Simon Bar Kokhba (enquiring about a delivery of supplies), as well as mirrors, a jewellery box and an astonishingly delicate glass plate, probably made in Alexandria, that somehow survived flight into the desert and the perilous climb up a cliff to the cave. Then there are three house keys, their wooden handles preserved, looking as if they would still open the locks for which they were made. Opper says: \"They\"re immediately touching -- these were used by people to lock their homes thinking they\"d be back in a week or two, but of course they weren't -- they all perished. And there are still many refugees now who still have keys to the homes they once lived in. It\"s a potent symbol of conflict.\" To the British Hadrian will always be associated with the wall that was built across northern England, an 117km rampart with a fortification every 1.6km. In schoolroom history this has traditionally been seen as a defence against the barbarian tribes to the north, but it wasn't necessarily so. \"The wall was a ruthlessly efficient symbol of oppression and in the end it broke the back of the local tribes,\" says Opper. Confirmation of this, perhaps, comes from two small writing tablets from the fortress of Vindolanda, the oldest surviving hand-written documents in the British Isles. In one an officer, presumably writing to a colleague who is taking over his post, derides the locals as the \"little British,\" not worthy of worrying about very much - brief, battered and faded the letter may be, but as an example of high-handed imperialism it is hard to beat.

Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, a suspected terrorist, is shown in photos released by the FBI. Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, indicted in the United States for alleged involvement in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, managed to evade police in a raid Saturday morning in Malindi, along Kenya's coast, said police spokesman Eric Kiraithe. The United States calls Mohammed a senior al Qaeda operative in East Africa. U.S. officials accuse him of being an architect of the embassy bombings that killed 225 people. They also believe Mohammed was involved in attacks on an Israeli-owned hotel and airliner in Kenya in 2002. Kiraithe said Kenyan authorities received information from \"local intelligence networks\" that led them to conduct the raid, which involved no foreign intelligence officials. He said police know Mohammed had, in fact, been at the location they raided, because they found two passports under names Mohammed has used. Kiraithe did not say what countries the passports were from. A massive manhunt is under way for Mohammed in Malindi and surrounding areas, \"more intensive than ever before because we wouldn't want to miss him now,\" Kiraithe said. The U.S. offers a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to his apprehension or conviction. Mohammed has escaped capture and attacks before. Early last year a U.S.-led air strike in Somalia failed to kill him. In 2003, Kenyan police said he escaped authorities. In December 2007, the U.N. Security Council amended a list of 25 al Qaeda suspects subject to sanctions, including Mohammed. The description of Mohammed offered numerous aliases and said he had \"reportedly undergone plastic surgery.\" The FBI description says Mohammed was born in the Comoros Islands, and has used birth dates indicating he was born in either 1972 or 1974. He also has citizenship in Kenya, the description says. It adds, \"Mohammed likes to wear baseball caps and tends to dress casually. He is very good with computers.\"", "af76b4c33b65666487dcc07f75d37de03ff61207": "ARBIL, Iraq (CNN) -- Two United Arab Emirates based companies announced on Tuesday that they will be investing in the Iraq's autonomous region of Kurdistan.

Russia's Channel 1 shows heavy tanks purported to be on their way to South Ossetia. President George Bush and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin discussed the conflict in Georgia, the White House confirmed. Both men were attending the opening of the Summer Olympics in the Chinese capital and spoke during a luncheon hosted by Chinese President Hu Jintao. White House spokesman Tony Fratto did not provide any additional details. But Putin, according to his spokesman, said: \"There are lots of volunteers being gathered in the region, and it's very hard to withhold them from taking part. A real war is going on.\" White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said: \"I want to reiterate on [President Bush's] behalf that the United States supports Georgia's territorial integrity and we call for an immediate cease fire. \"We urge all parties, Georgians, South Ossetians and Russians to de-escalate the tension and avoid conflict. We are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire and we are urging the parties to restart their dialogue.\" The U.S. military was also reviewing plans for the possible evacuation of the more than 2,000 of its citizens in the Republic of Georgia, two military officials said Friday. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told his counterparts in the United States and Germany and the European Union's foreign policy chief that Georgia was the aggressor and should immediately withdraw its troops from South Ossetia. The EU and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) are sending envoys to Georgia to secure a cease-fire, but a senior U.S. State Department official said the United States would only send a representative after a cease-fire is in place. The European Union said it was working with other parties \"towards a ceasefire in order to prevent further escalation of this conflict.\" EU spokeswoman Christina Gallach told CNN: \"We think it is not acceptable to see these scenes of bloodshed and destruction.\" OSCE chairman-in-office, Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb, said: \"The intense fighting in the South Ossetian conflict zone risks escalation into a full-fledged war. \"War would have a devastating impact for the entire region.

Britain also urged all sides to bring an immediate end to the violence. \"We are monitoring developments. We urge an immediate cease-fire in the fighting in South Ossetia and for a resumption of direct dialogue between all parties.\" Georgia, formerly part of the Soviet Union, is now looking west and has ambitions of joining NATO. South Ossetia has longed for and sometimes fought for independence since the 1920s when the Soviet Government made it an autonomous region within Georgia. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia broke away from Moscow in 1991 and South Ossetia voted overwhelmingly for its own independence. Violence has been mounting in the region in recent days, with sporadic clashes between Georgian forces and South Ossetian separatists. Georgian troops launched new attacks in South Ossetia late Thursday after a top government official said a unilateral cease-fire offer was met with separatist artillery fire. An emergency session of the U.N. Security Council on Friday discussed the dramatic escalation of violence. The session ended Friday morning without a statement about the fighting. Copyright 2008 CNN.

Today, almost everyone has a pocket-sized version that also takes photos, shoots video, sends e-mail and surfs the Internet. About the only thing it doesn't do is protect your feet. \"Get Smart\" comes to the big screen next week, along with a spate of new spy gadgets to help Maxwell Smart, Agent 99 and the other spies at CONTROL. The gadgets are just as goofy as they were in the original TV series, but because technology has caught up with the writers' imaginations, there's a big difference: many of the movie's doo-dads actually exist. \"Our favorite thing is to take something that does sort of exist and just exaggerate it a little bit,\" said Matt Ember, who co-wrote the script. The film shows a tiny iPod alongside spy-worthy stuff such as a two-way tooth radio and a digital \"spy fly\" -- all of which are available now. \"It's pushed to a level of success that perhaps it hasn't achieved in the real world, but it's real, it's out there, so that's fun\" added co-writer Tom J. Astle, a self-described science nut. Director Peter Segal said he originally couldn't believe such devices were real. \"I said, `That's too silly. I don't think people will buy it,\"' he recalled telling the writers. \"Then they Googled it and it came up as an actual thing.\" Astle and Ember saw the tooth radio in a magazine and thought it was a perfect fit for the film. \"That's an example of taking inspiration from the old series in spirit,\" Astle said. \"The inherent comedy of having a microphone in your mouth -- it's really close to your voice and it's easy to yell and be too loud.\" The inextricable link between gadgets and spy movies began with James Bond in 1962, said TV historian Tim Brooks, author of \"The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows.\" The often-preposterous devices Bond used added levity to a genre that \"had always been deadly serious\" during the early years of the Cold War, Brooks said. Back in the day, \"Get Smart\" ratcheted up the goofiness level with bulletproof pajamas, a Bunsen-burner phone and other wacky gadgets that often didn't work. When the show debuted in 1965, the nation was future-focused and obsessed with the promise of technology. The show played on that obsession, Brooks said, introducing dozens of covert gadgets and props designed to make life easier for Cold War-era secret agents. A cigarette lighter doubled as a .22-caliber gun. A lipstick could record conversations or release poisonous gas. Then there was the famous shoe phone and the always-dysfunctional \"cone of silence\" that could (theoretically) keep conversations private, even in a crowded room. \"It's nothing that you would expect to find or would even make sense in real life, and that's the gag,\" Brooks said. \"It was part of what the show was about. You'd watch wondering what's next, where's the phone going to be next time. ... It was like a satire of our fixation with gadgets.\" The movie also takes liberties with some familiar devices, such as portable lasers, retinal scanners and a tricked-out Swiss Army Knife equipped with a flame-thrower and a mini crossbow. Despite living in a high-tech world, movie fans still love spy gadgets, the filmmakers said: Just look at the success of the Bond franchise, which will soon introduce its 22nd installment, and spy spoofs such as \"Austin Powers.\" Part of it is the undercover element, part of it is a cultural love for technology, and part of it is wishful thinking. \"Human beings are tool-users,\" Astle said. \"We would like to believe that our government -- the good guys -- have within their power tools and electronic gadgets that will protect us that are beyond what we could do.\" \"There is some reality to it,\" Ember said. \"We do have facial-recognition software, but on the other hand, I'm not allowed to bring shampoo on an airplane.\"", "259d8cccfcb9b9edc00d757ec6efecde6fc06110": "(CNN) -- In focus: The business of education .

The Canadian frigate HMCS Ville de Quebec will escort ships carrying food aid to Somalia. \"Canada is stepping up to the plate by tasking Ville de Quebec with the role of escorting World Food Programme ships to ensure their safe arrival at designated ports,\" Canadian Defense Minister Peter MacKay said in a government news release. The United Nations hunger program praised Canada for answering its call for help, and said it hoped other governments would step forward to take over from Canada once it completes its mission in a few weeks. The HMCS Ville de Quebec is a 440-foot frigate armed with torpedoes, surface-to-air missiles and other weapons, and carries a twin-engine Sea King anti-submarine helicopter. Ville de Quebec, which can travel at speeds greater than 27 knots, will be dispatched after Somalia's transitional government formally authorizes the mission, the government's news release said. WFP asked the world's naval powers in mid-June to help its ships reach the more than 2 million people in need of aid. It put out the request weeks before French, Danish and Dutch warships ended their escort missions, which began in November. Pirate attacks on unescorted ships have been a growing problem in Somalia. Three European freighters were hijacked off the Horn of Africa in June, adding to the 27 other reported attacks this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which tracks piracy. WFP delivers 80 percent of its aid to Somalia by sea, and WFP spokesman Peter Smerdon said that if there are no warships to escort the food supply, the program will have to rely on ground or air travel to deliver the food. But both are dangerous and expensive. The agency said that if there is no assistance from naval powers, piracy will increase, and so will death and malnutrition.

Monsoon rain has bought heavy flooding to southern Nepal, pictured, and northern India. The Nepalese army Thursday used helicopters to rescue residents in southeastern Nepal who were stranded on treetops and roofs after monsoon flooding forced more than 50,000 people from their homes. In northern India monsoon flooding destroyed mud huts and killed at least 74 people, officials said. The deaths were in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The latest casualties bring to more than 300 the number of people killed in India since the start of this year's monsoon season. Nepalese officials said at least four southern villages were inundated with water after the embankment on the Saptakoshi River burst Monday. Some 40,000 people were now living in government-run relief camps; others had gone to other villages to stay with relatives, authorities said. Nepalese Home Ministry officials said there were unconfirmed reports of deaths related to the flooding but authorities could not reach the affected areas to verify those reports. Police and army troops had been using elephants, boats and helicopters to rescue stranded villagers in Sunsari district, about 400 km (249 miles) southeast of Kathmandu, since Monday.

Mohammed Alshaya, CEO of Alshaya's retail division, tells MME he sees a new mindset in the Gulf . Topshop, Coast, NEXT and River Island are just some of the big names he's imported from the United Kingdom to shopping centers in the Middle East. As chief executive of M.H. Alshaya, he knows what sells: tried and tested Western brands that will appeal to local shoppers. And his empire is not limited to clothing. In the past month, he's taken Mothercare and The Body Shop to Central Eastern Europe. With the addition of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, M.H. Alshaya now operates in 16 markets including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Cyprus, Turkey, Poland and Russia. John Defterios spoke with Mohammed Alshaya, and started by asking him for his thoughts on the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) plans for a single currency. (JD): I would imagine as a retail operation you'd be a huge proponent of a single currency within the GCC. Is it realistic within the next 4 to 5 years? (MA): I think it can be, as long as there is a will of the leaders to get together and decide. It is a huge leap towards efficiency, conciliation, getting closer between the six countries. One single Central Bank that governs and regulates is much better than the current six, I believe. (JD): Have you ever done any calculations of what impact it would have on your back office operations? (MA): Not yet, but it will be great, I think. (JD): You're one of the largest retail operations throughout the Arabian Peninsula. With all this growth that we're seeing right now, it must have a direct impact on the retail sector. What sort of annual growth are you experiencing? (MA): We're experiencing close to 25 percent annual growth, if not 30 percent in some cases, like in Dubai. (JD): Do you have any sort of concerns that this is going to be a bubble like the 1970s where the money was not deployed correctly? It seems different from my vantage point, do you share that view? (MA): There is a new generation of people from the region that are leading businesses and strong leadership in the government that have mitigated any concern. And if you see now the statistics, the Gulf is the seventh largest economy in the world. In ten, in 15 years time, it will be the fifth. So I see a new mindset, a new attitude. (JD): One of the other things I wanted to ask you about is your moves into other countries. The Alshaya group is very well known throughout the Arabian Peninsula, but you're moving into other markets, into Eastern Europe, specifically into Russia. Do you have the expertise to go into these markets? (MA): Well, yes. We have the expertise, and the expertise is by really retaining good management, and traveling with them into new markets. I'm not going to open shops myself. We have a very strong team in Russia; Russians that are taking our investment into good projects like Starbucks which we opened two months ago, two stores. We acquired a business there. So we have plans like Mothercare, Bodyshop, NEXT. (JD): So you can basically move this group into any city and have that potpourri of offers? (MA): We have the software. We have the software to launch the retail portfolio into a new market. (JD): Obviously you're a family business. You feel quite strongly about preserving culture and the family structure, and the need for family businesses to create jobs, because they represent 75 percent of all turnover in the Gulf. (MA): We have a social responsibility toward our people. We have to make sure we have jobs for them if the government is not going to compete, and is going to take away some of the people who would be relevant to our business. Another issue that might challenge us to do that is the wealth creation -- whether (potential employees) would be attracted to be in a department store selling or in a coffee shop making coffee -- that, we will see.

Sydney's Opera House is recognized instantly the world over, but there are plenty of hidden gems to be found. 08.00: Chinese food for breakfast might seem like something you would only do with a hangover, but yum cha -- think Chinese tapas on trolleys -- is a Sydney tradition. Head down to China Town in Haymarket and take your pick -- East Ocean (421-429 Sussex Street) is a favorite with Sydneysiders. 09.00: Walk off your breakfast with some shopping. You will see many international designers and a plethora of great home-grown ones too, from Sass & Bide to Collette Dinnigan. Sieve through the grand Queen Victoria Building (known as the QVB) and David Jones department store in town, then head east across Hyde Park -- stopping off at the art deco Anzac war memorial \u00ad-- towards Oxford Street, where there are some great boutiques. Sydney is also a good place to buy opals and pearls. 11.30: Continue east to the chi-chi 'old Sydney' suburbs of Paddington and Woollahra, where you will find some of the city's most beautiful architecture. Here the wrought iron balconies and the palm trees of the Victorian terrace houses lend the city a seductive, New Orleans feel. Stop for a coffee in one of the many fine coffee houses, then make your way up back up to Oxford Street and jump on the number 380 bus to Bondi. 12.30: For the best view of Bondi -- the quintessentialSydney beach -- get off the bus as it comes down the hill. From here, it is a short walk to Icebergs restaurant. From its vantage point on the coastal cliffs at the southern end -- overlooking the sweep of Bondi beach, the raging surf, and the gleaming white of the outdoor pool -- Icebergs is Sydney at its best. Tables at this renowned restaurant are hard to come by, so book ahead (www.idrb.com). After lunch, do the Bondi-to-Coogee coastal walk, which traces three bays -- Clovelly, Tamarama and Gordon's (a great snorkeling spot) -- and affords cliff-top views before finishing up, an hour or so later, at Coogee, a beach to the south. Once there, take your weary self down to Wylie's Baths, an outdoor sea water pool that has not changed since its inception in 1907, and get an al fresco massage (www.massagebythesea.com.au. From $25). 16.00: The best way to see the city -- which is laid out along the contours of a vast and beautiful natural harbor -- is from the air. Depending on your budget, you can take in the views from Sydney Tower (100 Market Street, $24.50), climb the Harbor Bridge (www.bridgeclimb.com, from $179), or charter a helicopter (www.sydneyhelicopters.com.au, from $180). If you want to see it from the 'ground', charter a yacht and join the harbor's fray (www.eastsail.com.au, from $625). 18.00: After a quick change, head down to Circular Quay for sun downers at the Opera Bar. With the Harbor Bridge to your left and the grand old Opera House to your right, it is easy to see why it is the place for evening drinks. House Brut is a steal at AUS$34 ($32); the bucket-sized portions of fries a snip at AUS$7 ($6.50). Do not be late, though -- the view here at dusk is enough to make you want to stay in Sydney forever. 19.00: While in the vicinity, see what is on at the Opera House -- there is a huge program, from world music to musicals too.(www.sydneyoperahouse.com). If that is not your scene, it is still worth taking a tour of the iconic building -- the last one is at 5pm, though ($32). 21.00: With Sydney famed for its cuisine, dining options are not in short supply. Billy Kwong's is one of the city's foremost places, dishing up vast portions of fresh, light and ever-so-tasty Chinese food in a tiny Shanghai tearoom-style restaurant (355 Crown Street, Surry Hills). For a taste of modern Australian, take a taxi to The Bathers' Pavilion, a seafood restaurant in the western suburb of Balmoral (4 The Esplanade, Balmoral Beach). Finally, Tetsuya's -- with its famed $195 10-course degustation menu -- is ranked by Restaurant magazine as the fourth best restaurant in the world (529 Kent Street, Sydney). To sit at its hallowed tables, you need to book several months -- possibly even a year -- in advance. 11.00: Still standing? Then hit the late-night bars. The Loft by the water (3 Lime Street, Kings Street Wharf, Sydney), Arthouse Hotel in the CBD (275 Pitt Street, Sydney), Ruby Rabbit in city's clubbing district (231 Oxford Street, Darlinghurst) and The Tilbury in one of Sydney's smartest suburbs (12 Nicholson Street, Woolloomooloo) are all good choices. And if you are at the latter, finish off your night with a pie at Harry's Cafe de Wheels (Cowper Wharf Road) -- another Sydney institution. CLICK HERE to subscribe to CNN Traveller .

A bias against liberals existed in a Justice program meant to hire young lawyers, an investigation found. Esther Slater McDonald, a political appointee at the Justice Department, \"wrote disparaging statements about the candidates' liberal and Democratic Party affiliations on the applications she reviewed and ... she voted to deselect candidates on that basis,\" said the report by Inspector General Glenn Fine. McDonald, who has left the department, refused to be interviewed for the investigation. The report, the first official investigation to document politicization of the Justice Department during the Bush administration, is an offshoot of the larger investigation of Justice Department politics triggered by the furor over the firing of nine U.S. attorneys. It found two of three members of a screening committee considered political views and experience when choosing new lawyers for the Justice Department Honors Program and Summer Law Intern Program. The report found that McDonald and Michael Elston, the chief of staff to Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty, engaged in misconduct, an administrative violation. The third member of the screening committee, career lawyer Dan Fridman, was cleared of any involvement in the politicization of the process. Elston was interviewed by the investigators, who asked him about the role of former Justice Department official Monica Goodling in politicizing the selection process. Elston told investigators he could not recall Goodling telling him to select lawyers who appeared to share Attorney General Alberto Gonzales' philosophy. Goodling testified before a House panel last year that she had told Elston he should identify such candidates. Goodling directed Elston to lead the selection committee in 2006. She and Elston have both left the Justice Department. She refused to be interviewed for the inspector general's report. As a result of the controversy, the hiring process was changed in 2007 to insulate hiring decisions from political considerations. Both Justice Department policy and federal law prohibit discrimination in hiring for career positions on the basis of political affiliations. The report did not find clear evidence that an earlier screening committee took political considerations into account. It says data from 2002 shows a disparity in the hiring of liberal and conservative candidates, but there were no complaints about the committee's work from 2003 to 2006, when Goodling put Elston in charge of the process. The report Tuesday is the first of perhaps several to be issued as the broad-ranging investigation into the role partisan politics has played in the Justice Department during the Bush administration. Goodling is expected to be a central figure in later inspector general reports examining efforts to increase the influence of conservatives in the department. The Justice Department Office of Professional Responsibility, a separate watchdog office that monitors prosecutorial conduct, joined in the inspector general's investigation.

Three hours later, it was downgraded to a tropical storm as winds fell below the 74 mph threshold for hurricane status.

If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. Roland Martin says journalists don't serve the public if they push rumors. (CNN) -- Two recent stories are a prime example of how important it is for the media to confront the reality of rumors in the age of the Internet. One week before comedian Bernie Mac passed away, text messages and e-mails were flying all over the country with reports that he had died. I was in New York, and friends and colleagues from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead. The rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead, which was subsequently published by the Chicago Sun-Times. What makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth, and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition. Then there is the \"rumor\" of an affair by former North Carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate John Edwards. The story was broken by the National Enquirer after months of digging. Ultimately, a source came forward and was\u00ad likely paid for the information \u00adthat blew the lid off of the story; the tabloid's editor said \"you can assume\" the Enquirer paid for it. The story exposed Edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened. There has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet wasn't able to verify the story and run with it. The heated discussions even reached the point where Charlotte Observer editor Rick Thames told PBS' \"NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself, \"When rumor arises, we're going to need to address it. And, unfortunately, we may need to address it before we can determine whether it's true or not because it's having impact, as it was in this case.\" Sorry, Rick, I disagree. The most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we don't traffic in rumor and innuendo. None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control. Running with such rumors has far-reaching implications. Just check out this month's Vanity Fair, where Bryan Burroughs has a great story on the collapse of Bear Stearns. The investment bank's demise, some conclude, was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems, even though it was sitting on $18 billion. The rumors kept going and going\u00ad and when the story hit the airwaves, it spread like wildfire. In one week, Bear Stearns was no more, and former company executives are still trying to determine what killed the Wall Street behemoth. We should forget the nonsense about the competitive pressure to break the story. The rules are simple: Either you have the facts or you don't. If you do, you run with the story. If you don't, you leave it alone. The National Enquirer got the story because its reporters were able to confront Edwards as he was leaving the Beverly Hills Hotel room of the woman with whom he later admitted having an affair. Then the paper got its hands on what it said was a photo of the 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee playing with a baby the Enquirer said was the child of the mistress. With other major media outlets turning up the heat, Edwards admitted the affair in an interview with ABC's Bob Woodruff. No media executive should be pulling his or her hair out, trying to figure out why they chose not to spread the rumor. If they had, and the facts didn't support the rumor, then we would all look like fools and that would have angered the public even more. We have an obligation to stick with the facts, and nothing else. And no matter what a blogger, Web site or tabloid paper has decided to run with, the day we choose to alter our standards, our credibility and integrity will be shot. In the end, as former ABC News anchor Max Robinson said in 1988, that's all we've got. Nothing is worth losing that, even getting the scoop on an affair involving a candidate whose political career is likely over. Roland S. Martin is an award-winning journalist and CNN contributor.

All three were headed home to Florida, and Stansell and Howes flashed their new Florida driver's licenses before they boarded a plane. The three men had been undergoing a reintegration process at the medical center. FARC had held the three U.S. government contractors since February 2003 after their plane went down in a remote region of the South American country. They and former Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt were among 15 hostages rescued on July 2 in a Colombian military operation. The three Americans arrived at Brooke Army Medical Center later that day. The three Americans urged the media not to forget the hundreds of other hostages still held by FARC. \"Don't forget the people that are still there,\" Stansell said. \"There are fellow hostages that are still there. Some have 10 years [as a hostage],\" he said. \"Right this minute, they're in chains, looking for food, and they're on the run. And their families haven't seen them in 10 years.\" It is estimated that FARC holds some 750 hostages. The leftist rebel group took up arms in 1964 and grew from a rag-tag band of 48 fighters to a self-styled \"people's army\" of more than 21,000 combatants in 2001, according to Colombian government figures. The government now estimates the FARC fighting force has dwindled to around 8,000 after a wave of desertions. On Saturday, the rescued Americans talked of looking forward to spending time with their relatives. \"We're going to go home now. We're going to rest, we're going to unwind for about a month and a half,\" Gonsalves said.", "4be9a7e5e9115eb681541c4a8d247ac84f0eb774": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush condemned the escalated violence between Russia and U.S.-backed Georgia on Sunday, while Vice President Dick Cheney said aggression against Georgia \"must not go unanswered.\" President Bush chats with Russian Prime Minister Vladmir Putin at the  start of the Olympic opening ceremonies. \"My administration has been engaged with both sides of this trying to get a ceasefire,\" Bush told NBC's Bob Costas in an interview in Beijing, China, where the president has attended Olympic events. Bush was filmed speaking to Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin during Friday's opening ceremonies and said Sunday that he \"was firm with Vladimir Putin\" and that \"this violence is unacceptable.\" Violence has continued to rage between Russia and the western ally since Thursday, when Georgia launched an operation to crack down on separatists in South Ossetia territory. Russia said it wanted to protect its peacekeepers already in South Ossetia following ceasefires in years past. But Georgia called it a full-on invasion. And while Russia has accused Georgia of a genocidal plot to cleanse the region of ethnic Ossetians loyal to Russia, Georgia accuses Russia of executing a long-planned war with the aim of taking control of the region -- including a key pipeline that carries Asian oil to Black Sea ports. \"I expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of Russia,\" Bush said of his talk with Putin. \"We strongly condemn bombing outside of South Ossetia.\" Putin says he's concerned about the flood of refugees arriving in Russia from South Ossetia. Russian officials said more than 30,000 refugees have left South Ossetia and crossed into Russia over the past two days, Interfax reported. \"The actions of the Georgian authorities in South Ossetia are a crime, of course, primarily a crime against their own people,\" Putin said, according to Russian news agency Interfax. Meanwhile, Cheney talked to Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili on Sunday, telling him that Russia's aggression against Georgia \"must not go unanswered.\" Cheney's spokeswoman Lea Ann McBride said the vice president spoke to Saakashvili to express \"the United States' solidarity with the Georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" Georgia withdrew its forces Sunday and offered a ceasefire, which Russia refused. \"The vice president told President Saakashvili that Russian aggression must not go unanswered, and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the United States, as well as the broader international community,\" McBride said. Saakashvili has called on the United States and the world community to stop the \"intervention and invasion of my sovereign country.\" \"I think the U.S. is the most powerful country in the world,\" he told CNN. \"I think the U.S. has lots of leverage. And I think there are lots of diplomatic means that it could be done through.\" Two senior officials have told CNN the United States sent envoy Matt Bryza to the region to help with mediation.", "de3ba4e29501a10effcbb5a61e7b9c0ab3721669": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- There's no question \"Tropic Thunder\" takes chances. Ben Stiller, left, and Robert Downey Jr. are among the stars of \"Tropic Thunder,\" a Hollywood satire. Tom Cruise almost unrecognizable as a foulmouthed, foul-mannered movie executive? Check. Mockery of action heroes, Method actors and gross-out comedians? Check. Challenging stereotypes at every opportunity? Absolutely. But casting Robert Downey Jr. as a black man? Well, that might be a bit much. Or maybe not. In \"Tropic Thunder,\" a comedy about self-absorbed Hollywood types making a \"Platoon\"-style war movie, Downey plays Australian actor Kirk Lazarus, a multiple Oscar-winning performer who gets so involved in his roles that he forgets to come out of them. He's a man constantly looking for ways to transform himself for his art. So, cast as a black man in the war movie, Lazarus decides to dye his skin surgically. Downey -- no slouch as an actor himself -- has often been seen as one who immerses himself fully in his roles. That kind of dedication prevented the character from coming off as offensive, said Ben Stiller, who directed, co-wrote and stars in \"Tropic Thunder.\" \"I give all the credit to Robert,\" Stiller told CNN. \"I felt he really was so committed to that character, the guy that was playing that guy, that as an audience you bought his sincerity. Very few people, I think, could pull that off.\" Brandon Jackson, who plays hip-hop star turned actor Alpa Chino (say it fast), agreed. \"Robert was black the whole time. My mom came on the set and she thought it was Don Cheadle,\" he told CNN. \"I'm serious. That's how black he was.\"  Watch Jackson talk about working with Downey \u00bb . The movie, which also stars Stiller as struggling action star Tugg Speedman and Jack Black as gross-out king Jeff Portnoy, features some testy altercations between Downey's Lazarus and Jackson's Chino. Lazarus gets so involved in his role that even when it's clear filming has wrapped for the day, he sticks with it -- which irritates Chino to no end. \"To me the most important thing was Alpa Chino has to give him a beat down and tell him that what he's doing is crazy the whole time,\" Downey said. \"Otherwise it's just demeaning to Brandon's character. And if it's demeaning to an actual black man in the movie ... I would have run for the hills.\" Jackson said he would have challenged the movie if the material was offensive. But, he said, \"Tropic Thunder\" is a long way from the days when white performers would don blackface as a way of exploiting black stereotypes. Since then, he said, the playing field has leveled: The Wayans brothers played \"White Chicks\" in the film of the same name, and Eddie Murphy has played several ethnicities in his films, including Jewish and Chinese characters. \"If we're all gonna play ball, let's all play ball,\" Jackson said. \"I believe in fairness. If we can punch you, punch back. And funny is funny.\" iReport.com: Will you see 'Tropic Thunder'? Stiller, of course, is no stranger to testing comedy limits. The actor, writer and director, known for films such as \"Meet the Parents\" and \"Zoolander,\" has performed or created roles that strike a delicate balance between sympathetic and distasteful -- and sometimes fall too hard on one side of the line. He co-wrote \"Tropic Thunder\" based on an idea he had in 1987, when many of his friends were making war movies, he recalls in the film's production notes. While Stiller was making \"Empire of the Sun,\" his colleagues were in boot camps training for their military roles -- and would emerge talking about the boot camp as if they'd become part of a real military unit. \"This sort of self-important, self-involved thing seemed funny to me,\" he said in the notes. \"I just couldn't figure a way to make that into a movie.\" Not immediately, anyway. But after several years, Stiller and his colleagues worked out a story that not only mocked actors, but filmmaking in general. In \"Thunder,\" after the studio threatens to shut down the big-budget production, the frustrated director (played by Steve Coogan) refuses to stop, and takes his cast deep into a Southeast Asia jungle to shoot \"guerrilla style.\" There they encounter danger in the form of drug lords. \"Tropic Thunder,\" which already has received praise from Newsweek's David Ansen and The Hollywood Reporter's Kirk Honeycutt, has also earned its share of knocks. The most serious have come from advocacy groups for the disabled, which are planning to picket Monday's Los Angeles premiere. In the film, Speedman has made a bid for an Oscar by playing \"Simple Jack,\" a developmentally disabled character. Other characters in \"Tropic Thunder\" dismiss Speedman's attempt to play what they refer to as a \"retard.\" Representatives of the Special Olympics, the Arc of the United States, the National Down Syndrome Congress, the American Association of People with Disabilities and other groups met with studio executives last week to discuss the film, but DreamWorks did not make any changes. \"We are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population,\" said Peter Wheeler, a spokesman for the Special Olympics, according to Reuters. In a statement Sunday, Chip Sullivan, a DreamWorks spokesman, said the movie was \"an R-rated comedy that satirizes Hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over-the-top characters in ridiculous situations.\" In the statement, Sullivan added that the film was not meant to disparage or harm people with disabilities and that DreamWorks expected to work closely with disability groups in the future. In junket interviews for the film, Stiller said that screening audiences definitely found \"Tropic Thunder\" funny. \"You go out there and put your best foot forward in terms of what you think you're doing, of what you think is the right idea,\" he said. \"If people are accepting it the way that you intended, and you feel that from a general audience ... then stand behind it.\" Downey trusts that after years of making themselves known as actors who can skillfully walk that fine line between funny and offensive, audiences will accept the film's satire -- his role in particular. \"I just hope at this point, with whatever little we've done to brand ourselves as entertainers, that you give us a little slack,\" he said.

New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin attends a ceremony Friday honoring Hurricane Katrina victims. Hurricane Gustav is poised to pass near or over the Cayman Islands on Friday night and over western portions of Cuba on Saturday. It may approach the U.S. Gulf Coast by Tuesday morning as a Category 2 or 3 hurricane, the National Hurricane Center said Friday. \"Today, on that third anniversary, we've got to be thinking about the future,\" Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour said. \"As we pray for the best, we're going to prepare for the worst,\" Barbour announced Friday that Hurricane Katrina victims living in government-issued trailers or mobile homes along his state's coast will begin evacuating this weekend to prepare for the Gustav's possible arrival. The process will begin Saturday, with notices going out to people living in Federal Emergency Management Agency trailers or mobile homes, as well as people living in more permanent structures known as \"Mississippi cottages,\" he said.  Watch the Gulf Coast states prepare for Gustav \u00bb . The evacuation will begin in Harrison and Hancock counties on Sunday morning, Barbour said. Evacuation in Jackson County will begin Monday. About 4,300 families live in FEMA trailers or mobile homes, and 2,800 live in Mississippi cottages, the governor's office said. He said he would urge people living in privately owned mobile homes to evacuate as well. President Bush declared an emergency in Louisiana on Friday, freeing up federal aid and allowing FEMA to coordinate relief efforts. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has declared a state of emergency and urged residents to update their evacuation plans. He said residents in certain southern parishes could be asked to leave Friday or Saturday. In Plaquemines Parish, where Hurricane Katrina roared ashore as a Category 3 storm days after its initial landfall in Florida, Parish President Billy Nungesser called for a mandatory evacuation beginning at noon Saturday. Residents of the community of Grand Isle in Jefferson Parish were urged to begin voluntary evacuations Friday afternoon, and voluntary evacuations for Jean Lafitte, Crown Point, Barataria and areas outside the levee protection system are recommended beginning at noon Saturday, the parish said in a news release. St. Bernard Parish, which was beginning transport Friday for those who would need assistance, said it expected to call a mandatory evacuation Saturday afternoon. In New Orleans, which has yet to fully recover from Hurricane Katrina, Mayor Ray Nagin on Thursday urged residents living in FEMA units to make evacuation plans in case city officials order them to leave.  Watch Sean Callebs report on if New Orleans is prepared \u00bb . \"Travel trailers are unsafe during heavy winds,\" he said. \"As we continue to monitor and prepare for the possibility of Hurricane Gustav, I want all of our citizens to make certain they have a plan for leaving the trailers when advised to do so.\" As of early this week, there were 2,829 FEMA trailers in Orleans Parish, the mayor's office said. The city has designated 17 sites for people without transportation to board buses that would take them out of the city in the event of a mandatory evacuation. The city also arranged with Amtrak for more than 7,000 seats to evacuate the elderly by train, said Jerry Sneed of City Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness. Signs of mobilization were apparent at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, where nearly every departure gate had long lines of elderly people in wheelchairs. Rental car counters normally attended by tourists were filled with relief workers from the Red Cross and the Fire Department of New York's Disaster Assistance Response Team. The DART team consisted of retired New York firefighters, jovial men with graying hair and larger waistlines. Many are volunteers assisting the Red Cross who were in New York during the September 11 attacks and wanted to give back. The 40-member DART team of heavy-equipment operators, truck drivers and registered nurses was headed to Alexandria, Louisiana, to set up an evacuation shelter. After the storm, the team will feed, shelter and re-supply people in the areas affected by Gustav. \"Whatever small way you're able to help, it's a great feeling,\" said Kevin Wallace, a 23-year FDNY veteran who's helped after six disasters. \"Whatever they need us to do, we do.\" All 2,500 inmates in Orleans Parish would be bused out from state and local facilities, Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff Marlin Gusman told the New Orleans Times-Picayune. New Orleans Police Chief Warren Riley said this week that hundreds of officers will be posted in the uptown, downtown, Central City and West Bank areas to ensure an adequate law enforcement presence in the event of an emergency. During Katrina, many New Orleans officers were accused of leaving their posts as widespread crime and looting permeated the city. Sixty-seven officers were fired for it, Riley said. In addition to the police department's actions, at least 1,500 Louisiana National Guard members arrived in New Orleans on Friday. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his concerns for New Orleans are twofold. First, he was worried about areas of potential weakness in the levee system, which he said the Army Corps of Engineers monitor closely, and second, rainfall. \"You can build levees that are 100 feet high; it's not going to keep the rain out of the city. A very, very intense period of rain could flood the city, because the pace of the rainfall could exceed the ability to pump out of the city,\" he said. The only thing to do was prepare, he said. \"We evacuate; we protect the integrity of the levees; we continue to strengthen the levees; that's part of a total system of really driving down the risk to the people of New Orleans,\" he said. The Louisiana National Guard has requested 20 helicopters from eight states to replace its helicopter air assault battalion, which is now serving in Iraq with its 20 UH-60 Black Hawks. The Guard is asking for UH-60 helicopters for search and rescue, as well as CH-47s, Chinooks, which could drop large sandbags if the levees are breached. A 40-person aviation headquarters unit also is being requested and probably will be provided by the Arkansas National Guard to handle air traffic control and communications for any air operations that might be needed. In Texas, Gov. Rick Perry pre-emptively declared an emergency in 61 Texas counties. He said also the state had agreed to take into its shelters several thousand Louisiana residents, should they evacuate.

American Airlines was fined for allowing aircrafts to fly while they knew they needed repairs. \"The FAA believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because American Airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed, and instead deferred maintenance,\" the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement announcing the decision. \"In intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft, the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew.\" American can still appeal the fines, the FAA said. The FAA also found the airline maintained inadequate drug- and alcohol-testing programs and failed to inspect safety lighting on a \"timely\" basis. The Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier said Thursday evening that it disagreed with the findings and called the penalties \"excessive.\" \"In accordance with FAA procedures for handling these matters, we have requested to meet with the FAA after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings, so that we may discuss the issues,\" the airline said in a written statement. \"Since these matters are ongoing with the FAA, we will not have any further comment at this time.\" Nearly $4.5 million of the proposed fines stem from American's continued operation of two MD-83 jetliners in December 2007 after pilots reported problems with the autopilot systems, the FAA said. The two planes were flown a combined 58 times before the problems were corrected -- and one flew 10 times after an FAA inspector notified the airline that it had wrongly deferred needed repairs. In one incident, the autopilot disconnected during a landing on December 21, the FAA said. \"American technicians did not check for the actual problem, and instead deferred maintenance using an inappropriate MEL (minimum equipment list) item. The plane flew another 36 passenger-carrying flights during December 21-31.\" The problem was later traced to a piece of radio gear separate from the autopilot, the FAA said. Meanwhile, a different MD-83 flew four flights without a fully functioning autopilot after American mechanics put off repairs.  Regulators also accuse American of operating planes without timely inspections of their emergency lighting systems. In April, American canceled more than 3,000 flights to conduct inspections of wiring bundles in wheel wells of its 300 MD-80 jets, snarling air traffic for five days. The FAA ordered American and several other airlines to examine the wiring, which had the potential to start fires or cause landing gear to malfunction.", "fd13c81373473f862d0f3559ffbc2a03fa95f492": "(CNN) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee are expected to ask a federal judge Monday to shut down Web sites they allege scam customers trying to buy Olympic tickets, according to court documents.

The IOC and the USOC filed lawsuits on July 22 against several Web sites -- primarily www.beijingticketing.com and www.beijing-2008tickets.com -- for illegally using Olympic trademarks to dupe customers into giving them credit card, passport and banking information. Lawyers for the IOC and USOC are expected to petition U.S. District Court Judge Jeffrey White on Monday to permanently shut down several sites listed in the lawsuit. The lawsuit names the company XL & H Ltd, known as Xclusive Leisure & Hospitality Ltd. and six other Web sites believed to be fraudulent. Several consumers who purchased tickets from the site contacted the USOC when they did not receive tickets, despite numerous calls and e-mails to the Web sites founder, according to a USOC press release. The scam has hit Olympic fans in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, England, Japan, China and Norway, according to media reports. Australian Olympic Committee President John Coates told local media that relatives of the country's softball team had been victims of the site. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the New South Wales Government set up a hotline for those duped out of tickets. The hotline has received hundreds of calls from around the globe with consumers detailing losses as high as $57,000.

Chinn's face for television: Picking up his Asian TV Award in 2007. English boarding school taught him that food could be an awful experience; Wall Street taught him that creativity was more important than money and a stint as a stand-up comedian taught him that you can't always get it right. Half Chinese, half Egyptian, Chinn's grandmothers were his first introduction to the variety and pleasure that food can bring. While his palate was subdued by the meals he was given at school in England when he was a boy, his meandering route to becoming a chef came some time after attaining a degree in Finance and Economics. Moving to New York after graduating he worked on Wall Street. \"You didn't produce anything at the end of a day and you didn't breathe fresh air, you didn't know what the weather was like outside because you were on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. It's like the dungeon of capitalism where time and money met,\" he told CNN's Talk Asia. Chinn escaped \"the dungeon\" after a year and a half to the sunny climes of California, but it wasn't to laze around. An addiction to high-octane and challenging environments saw Chinn explore the possibility of being a stand-up comic. \"I was always afraid to talk in front of the class and now I am trying to make them laugh\" he told CNN. \"One day you are really funny and then you go to another gig the same night and nobody laughs and then at the same time you are living a life of poverty. When you are bombing as a comic I don't think there can be a worse life.\" While finding out the hard way how funny, or not, he was, Chinn was working front-of-house in restaurants, nurturing his love of food. His break came when Hubert Keller from San Francisco restaurant Fleur de Lys took him on as a volunteer in his kitchen. \"He gave me a job and after one week he said 'OK, you can stay.' And then when you work with one really great chef, then I think you can work anywhere,\" he said. After also training with chefs in France, Chinn made his own mark on the culinary world when he opened his first restaurant in Vietnam in 1995, and at first found the going tough. \"Supplies were not consistent, the language barrier, the taste barrier, the hygiene barriers. Those are very taxing on a person like me with very little patience.\" A high-energy chef and now a TV celebrity who presents \"World Caf\u00e9 Asia\" -- he won an Asian Television Award in 2007 -- Chinn is aware that being flavor of the month on TV is transitory. \"It is just a machine that feeds on people like me and then spits me out when my time is done.

LUCIE, Florida (CNN)  -- Tropical Storm Fay, stalled near Cape Canaveral, Florida, soaked portions of east-central Florida late Wednesday, and the National Hurricane Center said it could dump 30 inches of rain in some areas of the state. Streets are flooded Wednesday in Port St. Lucie, Florida, in a photo from iReporter Bethany Schulstrom. As of 11 p.m. ET, the storm was just off the coast of central Florida about 35 miles southeast of Daytona Beach, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm was moving slowly but could make landfall again in northern Florida Thursday, the hurricane center said. It would be the fourth time the storm makes landfall. Fay has come ashore in Florida twice after making landfall in Cuba. NASA reported receiving 21 inches of rain from the storm Wednesday, said Craig Fugate, Florida's emergency management director. Forecasters said they received an unofficial report of 22 inches northwest of Melbourne, Florida. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist has asked President Bush to declare an emergency in the state to free up federal funding. The storm \"is producing historic flooding across a large portion of Brevard County,\" Crist wrote in a letter to Bush. \"Fay has and will continue to produce copious amounts of rain over a large portion of northeast Florida as the storm turns westward on August 21. \"Fay remains a significant threat,\" Crist continued, noting that tornadoes have touched down in seven counties. The governor pre-emptively declared a state of emergency last week. As of 11 p.m. ET, Fay the storm had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), and it was expected to move slowly toward the northwest overnight, according to a hurricane center advisory. \"This general motion is expected tonight with a gradual turn to the northwest and west-northwest on Thursday,\" the National Hurricane Center said. \"On this track, Fay is forecast to move very slowly across northern Florida on Thursday.\" Fay could make its fourth landfall Thursday along the Florida coast, possibly in the Jacksonville-Daytona Beach area, forecasters said. \"The storm continues to be a threat to this community,\" Jacksonville Mayor John Peyton said. \"Looks like the worst is still ahead.\" Peyton said Jacksonville had set up shelters should people need them. Storm tides of 1 to 3 feet above normal are possible along the Florida's east coast, to the north of the center of Fay, the hurricane center said, adding that isolated tornadoes are possible over portions of northeastern Florida and southeast Georgia. The storm forced NASA to close for a second day because of \"potential wind threat,\" NASA said on its Web site. The agency was to announce Wednesday night whether it would also be shut Thursday. The U.S. Navy announced Wednesday afternoon that it was moving several ships and aircraft in anticipation of Fay's arrival in northeast Florida. Naval Air Station Jacksonville has evacuated 24 P-3 Orion aircraft to bases in Maine and Ohio. On the southeast coast of Florida, Fay flooded hundreds of homes in St. Lucie County, authorities said. Rescuers were using airboats and other means Wednesday to pick up stranded residents. Earlier in the day, the county's Public Safety Department said that as many as 8,000 homes might be affected in two low-lying areas but later scaled the number back. Crist announced the first known storm-related death. A 54-year-old man died from carbon monoxide fumes as he tested two gasoline-powered generators in his home in Highlands County, northwest of Lake Okeechobee in eastern Florida, Crist said, quoting the county's medical examiner. Crist said he wasn't sure when the man died, but the medical examiner received the body Monday. The severe flooding in St. Lucie County took authorities by surprise. Meg Defore said that the first floor of her home was 14 feet above ground but that water had reached the top of her doors. She left in a small boat. Near the north fork of the St. Lucie River, water gushed down streets and lapped at the doors of parked cars. iReporter Bethany Schulstrom, 16, said water was up to people's knees in the streets of Port St. Lucie. \"They sent a warning to everyone not to leave [their homes] because the snakes are coming out of their holes and there's fish everywhere,\" she said.

Members of Santa Cruz's Juvenile Union burn wood during protests Tuesday in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Officials in Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, Tarija -- states in the wealthy, eastern lowland known as the \"Media Luna,\" or half-moon -- and Chuquisaca, also in the eastern part of the country, instructed residents not to leave their homes until the end of the one-day strike, Bolivian newspaper El Diario reported. The five departments contain much of the Andean country's natural gas deposits, and their leaders are asking for natural gas revenue that Morales has earmarked to increase funding for pension plans, the five regions said in a statement on the strike posted on Santa Cruz's Web site. They said they were \"sorry that the inflexibility of the government forced the prefectures to take this type of resolution.\" Confrontations between government supporters and pro-autonomy groups in a Santa Cruz neighborhood appeared to be the day's most violent. Police fired tear gas three times at demonstrators. In the other four departments where the strike was being observed, there were no disturbances. The 24-hour strike was called by civil committees of the departments to demand that the government give back the money it has collected by taxing hydrocarbons in order to fund the pension plan. The president of Santa Cruz's civic committee, Branco Marincovick, said the tax is constraining regional development. The government condemned acts of violence during the day and said that the strike was limited. The strike comes nine days after Morales garnered more than 67 percent of votes in a recall referendum, which he had proposed in May to break a power struggle long simmering between him and the conservative leadership in the Media Luna states. Despite the solid show of support for Morales, the vote also endorsed the leaders in Santa Cruz, Pando, Beni and Tarija, making it impossible to reach a solution to the stalemate. Morales, a former labor organizer and the country's first indigenous president, was elected in 2005 on promises to reform Bolivia's constitution for the benefit of its indigenous majority. But his proposals have been hampered by his rivals in the Media Luna states. Since taking office, all four have pushed for greater autonomy, saying the individual departments have the right to control their own affairs, including increased access to gas revenues. In speaking about the revenues earmarked for increased pensions, Morales emphasized that it was for the good of the people, a refrain he often uses. \"Some authorities believe that this money is theirs, and it is not so, this silver is of the people and should benefit the people,\" the president said last year, shortly after he announced the measure. Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research, a nonpartisan think-tank, said Morales' overwhelming victory at the polls strengthens his hand at achieving his goal of redistributing wealth. Less than one percent of landowners in Bolivia own two-thirds of the country's farmland, he said in an article published in The Nation magazine. \"Bolivia is South America's poorest country, with 60 percent of the population living below the poverty line, and 38 percent in extreme poverty,\" he said. \"The voters have overwhelmingly decided that they want their government to do something about that. This should be possible, even if it means redistributing some of the country's most important natural resources.\" CNN's Gloria Carrasco contributed to this report.", "45884af9aff9abf54fec27f510c3f9ed000fc6e1": "(CNN) -- Actor and filmmaker Joe Pantoliano, known for his role as Ralph Cifaretto on the HBO series \"The Sopranos,\" attended the Democratic National Convention on Monday to raise awareness about people living with mental illness. Joe Pantoliano has met with the Obama and McCain camps to promote mental health and recovery. Pantoliano, founder and president of the eight-month-old advocacy organization No Kidding, Me Too, released a teaser of his new film about various forms of mental illness. At the CNN Grill, he answered five questions for CNN.com. CNN.com: What are you doing out here in Denver? Pantoliano: I've always been fascinated by the political process ever since I was a kid. ... I always love the festive partying, the camaraderie, the working for the candidate, whether it was somebody in the 3rd Ward where I lived in New Jersey in Hoboken or a senator or a congressman or even when a president would come. I remember when President Kennedy came down to Hoboken in '61 and I was only 10 years old. I was with the Kennedys tonight. CNN.com: Are you a Barack Obama supporter? Pantoliano: I'm advocating my organization. I'm going to the [Republican National Convention} next week. I'm speaking on mental illness and the miracles of recovery; that's what the movie is about. I've met with the Obama chief of staff and the Obama people; I've met with McCain people. Mental illness is on the tip of their minds. CNN.com: Who are you voting for? Pantoliano: I don't know yet.  Watch how celebrity endorsements can backfire \u00bb . CNN.com: Where are the hot spots in Denver? Where are people hanging out? Pantoliano: Here, the CNN Grill. It's all they're talking about. I really like Denver. The security is less kinetic [than] it was four years ago. That whole fear thing that this administration has played on our nerves; I think I have post-traumatic stress over that. What happened was I became addicted to the news. iReport.com: Are you in Denver? Share sights, sounds . CNN.com: Do you think that coming out to a convention helps you make up your mind better than sitting in your living room? Pantoliano: I'm an independent. I can be inspired tonight by Michelle Obama's speech, and then something happens next week, so I'm going back and forth. I'm a flip-flopper. The difference that I see between the Republicans and the Democrats are that the Democrats really are a force of what the melting pot of our society is. Obama really represents that.

John McCain wrote defending his Iraq war policy. Sen. John McCain wrote an op-ed for The New York Times, but the paper said it could not publish it as written. The piece was in response to an op-ed from Sen. Barack Obama that was published in the paper last week. In an e-mail to the McCain campaign, Opinion Page Editor David Shipley said he could not accept the piece as written, but would be \"pleased, though, to look at another draft.\" \"Let me suggest an approach,\" he wrote Friday. \"The Obama piece worked for me because it offered new information (it appeared before his speech); while Senator Obama discussed Senator McCain, he also went into detail about his own plans. It would be terrific to have an article from Senator McCain that mirrors Senator Obama's piece.\" Read McCain's rejected piece . In a statement released Monday, The New York Times said it is \"standard procedure on our Op-Ed page, and that of other newspapers, to go back and forth with an author on his or her submission.\" \"We look forward to publishing Senator McCain's views in our paper just as we have in the past. We have published at least seven Op-Ed pieces by Senator McCain since 1996. The New York Times endorsed Senator McCain as the Republican candidate in the presidential primaries. We take his views very seriously,\" the statement said. McCain's rejected op-ed was a lengthy critique of Obama's positions on Iraq policy, particularly his view of the surge. \"Senator Obama seems to have learned nothing from recent history,\" wrote McCain, criticizing Obama's call for an early withdrawal timeline. \"I find it ironic that he is emulating the worst mistake of the Bush administration by waving the 'Mission Accomplished' banner prematurely.\"  Watch why the piece was rejected \u00bb . Obama's July 14 essay had taken shots at McCain for not further encouraging the Iraqi government to take control of the country. \"Instead of seizing the moment and encouraging Iraqis to step up, the Bush administration and Senator McCain are refusing to embrace this transition -- despite their previous commitments to respect the will of Iraq's sovereign government,\" Obama wrote in his op-ed. \"They call any timetable for the removal of American troops 'surrender,' even though we would be turning Iraq over to a sovereign Iraqi government.\" Read Obama's essay . Shipley, who was President Bill Clinton's senior speechwriter from 1995 to 1997, had advised the McCain campaign that \"the article would have to articulate, in concrete terms, how Senator McCain defines victory in Iraq. \"It would also have to lay out a clear plan for achieving victory -- with troops levels, timetables and measures for compelling the Iraqis to cooperate. And it would need to describe the senator's Afghanistan strategy, spelling out how it meshes with his Iraq plan.\" He added that he hoped the parties could \"find a way to bring this to a happy resolution.\" McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said Monday the Arizona senator's position will not change based on the \"demands of the New York Times.\" \"John McCain believes that victory in Iraq must be based on conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables,\" he said. \"Unlike Barack Obama, that position will not change based on politics or the demands of the New York Times.\" The newspaper endorsed McCain for the Republican presidential nomination in January, shortly before the New York primary. In February, after it became clear McCain would be his party's presumptive nominee, the paper published a thinly sourced report that McCain once had a close relationship with a female lobbyist. McCain said he was disappointed in the New York Times piece. The paper said that it stood by its reporting and that \"the story speaks for itself.\" McCain's campaign sent out fundraising appeals based on the article. The article \"is particularly disgusting -- an un-sourced hit-and-run smear campaign designed to distract from the issues at stake in this election,\" McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, wrote in a e-mail to supporters. \"We need your help to counteract the liberal establishment and fight back against the New York Times by making an immediate contribution today,\" the e-mail said in text that linked to an online contribution form on the McCain campaign's Web site.", "265ad4cbd8cbad94527db327a39c2d8f33db33ce": "CERN, Switzerland (CNN) -- Scientists Wednesday applauded as one of the most ambitious experiments ever conceived got successfully underway, with protons being fired around a 27-kilometer (17-mile) tunnel deep beneath the border of France and Switzerland in an attempt to unlock the secrets of the universe. Scientists applaud during the switch on operation of the Large Hadron Collider. The Large Hadron Collider -- a $9 billion particle accelerator designed to simulate conditions of the Big Bang that created the physical Universe -- was switched on at 0732 GMT to cheers and applause from experts gathered to witness the event. While observers were left nonplussed by the anticlimactic flashing dots on a TV screen that signalled the machine's successful test run, among teams of scientists involved around the world there were jubilant celebrations and popping champagne corks. In the coming months, the collider is expected to begin smashing particles into each other by sending two beams of protons around the tunnel in opposite directions. Skeptics, who claim that the experiment could lead to the creation of a black hole capable of swallowing the planet, failed in a legal bid to halt the project at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Others have branded it a colossal waste of cash, draining resources from its multinational collaborators that could have been spent on scientific research with more tangible benefits to mankind. Sound off: What do you think of the experiment? French President Nicolas Sarkozy hailed the project as a major achievement for Europe. \"The repercussions of this scientific investment without precedent in the history of humanity will be essential not only for the intimate knowledge of our universe, but also for the direct applications in fields as varied as intensive calculation or even medicine,\" he said.  Watch as Big Bang experiment gets underway \u00bb . The collider will operate at higher energies and intensities in the next year, potentially generating enough data to make a discovery by 2009, experts say. They say the experiment has the potential to confirm theories that physicists have been working on for decades including the possible existence of extra dimensions. They also hope to find a theoretical particle called the Higgs boson -- sometimes referred to as the \"God particle,\" which has never been detected, but would help explain why matter has mass. The collider will recreate the conditions of less than a millionth of a second after the Big Bang, when there was a hot \"soup\" of tiny particles called quarks and gluons, to look at how the universe evolved, said John Harris, U.S. coordinator for ALICE, a huge detector specialized to analyze that question. Since this is exploratory science, the collider may uncover surprises that contradict prevailing theories, but which are just as interesting, said Joseph Lykken, theoretical physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. \"When Columbus sails west, he thought he was going to find something. He didn't find what he thought he was going to find, but he did find something interesting,\" said Lykken, who works on the Compact Muon Solenoid, one of six experiments inside the collider complex. Why should the layperson care about this particular exploration? Years ago, when electrons were first identified, no one knew what they were good for, but they have since transformed our entire economy, said Howard Gordon, deputy research program manager for the collider's ATLAS experiment. \"The transformative effect of this research will be to understand the world we live in much better,\" said Gordon, at Brookhaven National Laboratory. \"It's important for just who we are, what we are.\" Fears have emerged that the collider could produce black holes that could suck up anything around them -- including the whole Earth. Such fears prompted legal actions in the U.S. and Europe to halt the operation of the Large Hadron Collider, alleging safety concerns regarding black holes and other phenomena that could theoretically emerge. Although physicists acknowledge that the collider could, in theory, create small black holes, they say they do not pose any risk. A study released Friday by CERN scientists explains that any black hole created would be tiny, and would not have enough energy to stick around very long before dissolving. Five collider collaborators who did not pen the report independently told CNN there would be no danger from potential black holes. John Huth, who works on the collider's ATLAS experiment, called such fears \"baloney\" in a recent interview, and noted that in normal physics, even if the black hole were stable, it could just pass through the Earth without being detected or without interacting at all. \"The gravitational force is so weak that you'd have to wait many, many, many, many, many lifetimes of the universe before one of these things could [get] big enough to even get close to being a problem,\" said Huth, professor of physics at Harvard University.

The overriding goal for Hillary Clinton on Tuesday night was to redirect her supporters toward Barack Obama. Its content was a mystery to even some of her closest advisers, who told CNN hours before the speech they weren't sure it was finished quite yet. It was a work in progress until the very end -- and one of its strongest rallying cries appeared nowhere in the prepared text. \"That is our mission, Democrats -- Let us elect Barack Obama and Joe Biden,\" the New York senator told a capacity crowd waving signs that said \"unity\" on one side and bore either Clinton's or Obama's name on the other. So far, the Democratic convention has been dominated by news of the Clintons. What would Hillary Clinton say Tuesday night? And what would her husband, former President Bill Clinton, say Wednesday night? Would daughter Chelsea introduce her mother onstage, fueling visions of another Democratic dynasty? And what will happen Wednesday, when the convention roll call will either provide the \"catharsis\" Clinton predicted it might -- or reopen primary season wounds?  Watch Clinton's entire speech \u00bb . The overriding goal for Clinton Tuesday night was to redirect the energy and emotion of her strongest supporters to the presumptive nominee's campaign -- if not for his political future, for her own. If the rank-and-file believe a schism in the party generated by her supporters cost Democrats the election, it could sabotage any potential White House plans for her. She pushed for her loyalists to back her primary season rival with language that echoed her stump speech about forgotten Americans: . \"I want you to ask yourselves: Were you in this campaign just for me?\" she asked. \"Or were you in it for that young Marine and others like him? Were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids? Were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage? Were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible?\" Read what analysts say about Clinton's speech . She gave Obama the seal of approval on health care, an issue that made for some of her toughest language on the trail. \"I can't wait to watch Barack Obama sign a health care plan into law that covers every single American,\" she said. There were a few notable gaps. There was little on foreign policy. There was no unequivocal statement that Barack Obama is qualified to be commander in chief and ready to lead from Day One. McCain advisers noted soon after the speech, there was no mention of the candidates' differing stands on abortion -- one issue which might have been expected to resonate with those women who supported Clinton and have been slow to warm to Obama. But Clinton's language about what was at stake this November could have been lifted from a speech by any of the most passionate Obama supporters. \"Nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance,\" she told the crowd. \"I want you to think about your children and grandchildren come Election Day. And think about the choices your parents and grandparents made that had such a big impact on your life and on the life of our nation.\" Clinton has not addressed whether another presidential campaign is possible anytime in her future, but some of her senior advisers have been less reticent. There's no way to tell whether their predictions come from inside knowledge or wishful thinking, but senior Clinton aides like former campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe and former campaign communications director Howard Wolfson have told reporters this week that they expect her to make another run for the White House in eight years -- after a two-term Obama presidency. If that happens, Tuesday night may have marked the first speech of her 2016 campaign.", "3b5e3dff560e2233e8370c87e9d92461200f8bd4": "MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Relatives of a woman killed in a Spanish airline crash were erroneously given the remains of another victim, and then were asked by authorities to return them, CNN partner network CNN+ reported Thursday. The victims of the crash were first laid out at a Madria convention center. A Madrid judge has opened an investigation into the error, and judicial sources say the initial indication is that the mixup occurred not in the proper identification of the victim, but in delivering the wrong remains to the family in question, CNN+ reported. The family Wednesday received an urn numbered 104, and were told it contained the ashes of their loved one, Pilar Gonzalez Ferreira, who died in the crash. But as the family was preparing to leave Madrid, officials called to tell them about the error and asked for the return of urn 104, CNN+ reported. Instead of urn 104, the family was supposed to have received urn 134, which actually contains the remains of Pilar Gonzalez, CNN+ reported, citing judicial sources and another family which also lost a relative in the crash. The Spanair MD82 jet crashed last week at Madrid's airport as the plane was trying to take off, killing 154 people. The aircraft, bound for Spain's Canary Islands, managed to rise only slightly before coming down quickly to the right of the runway, its tail section hitting the ground first, just off the asphalt. Then the out-of-control plane skidded and bounced at least three times as it careered 1,200 meters (3,840 feet) across uneven terrain and exploded, coming to rest in a gully, a top official of the investigative commission told a news conference in Madrid on Tuesday. Many of the bodies were badly charred from the fire, and authorities have used DNA samples to carry out numerous identifications. By Thursday, 126 victims had been identified, CNN+ reported. Just a few dozen families are still waiting to receive the remains their loved ones. Most are gathered at a Madrid hotel near the airport. Nineteen people initially survived the crash, but one died in hospital last weekend. Fourteen survivors remain hospitalized in Madrid; one had returned to her native Sweden for further hospitalization there, and another was in a hospital in the Canary Islands.

Soldiers at a U.S. base in Afghanistan on Thursday honor the victims of September 11, 2001. According to numbers CNN has compiled from military statements, 112 American troops have died in Afghanistan in 2008, compared with 111 in all of 2007. The death toll has sparked concern among the U.S. military and its allies. Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a congressional committee Wednesday that the U.S. is \"running out of time\" to win the war in Afghanistan. Mullen said the U.S. needs better nation-building initiatives and a stronger cross-border strategy with Pakistan to ensure victory over Islamic militants in the poor Asian country. \"We can't kill our way to victory, and no armed force anywhere, no matter how good, can deliver these keys alone. It requires teamwork and cooperation,\" Mullen told the House Armed Services Committee. In addition to those killed in Afghanistan, the military also includes troops who died outside the country if they were part of Operation Enduring Freedom, the war launched nearly seven years ago in and around Afghanistan. The broader count includes two Americans who died in Djibouti in 2008. The 2007 count includes two Americans who died in Ethiopia, two in the Philippines, one in Mali, one in Pakistan and one at sea near the Horn of Africa. According to CNN numbers, 585 Americans have died in the course of Operation Enduring Freedom, 506 of them in Afghanistan. The numbers include hostile and nonhostile incidents. Both the U.S.-led coalition and the NATO command announced three more deaths Thursday -- a British soldier in southern Afghanistan on Wednesday and two others in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday. The nationalities of the latter two have not been disclosed. The British death brings the country's toll to 118.

One of the first pictures of the elusive okapi was taken by camera trap. The okapi is a shy animal related to the giraffe, with zebra-like stripes on its rear. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Africa but is now known to live only in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Okapis were last seen in the DRC 50 years ago, and the images are the first to capture the animal in the wild. \"To have captured the first-ever photographs of such a charismatic creature is amazing,\" said Noelle Kumpel, manager of the Bushmeat and Forests Conservation Program at the Zoological Society of London, which took the pictures. \"Okapi are very shy and rare animals, which is why conventional surveys only tend to record droppings and other signs of their presence.\" The okapi's face and long legs resemble those of the giraffe, their closest-living relative, but they look more like horses with long necks. The average height of their shoulders is 1.6 meters (5 feet, 3 inches), the ZSL says. They have a short, dense, velvety coat and dark prehensile tongue long enough to clean their own eyelids and ears. The new pictures show the okapi in the foliage of the DRC's Virunga National Park, where decades of economic collapse and armed conflict have threatened the diverse wildlife. In one image, an okapi looks curiously toward the camera amid the green trees and groundcover. Its large ears, dark nose, and zebra stripes are clearly visible. The next shot shows the okapi walking away from the camera, giving a clear view of its striking black-and-white stripes on its rear legs. A third image released by ZSL was taken at night and gives a vivid side view of the animal. \"The photographs clearly show the stripes on their rear, which act like unique fingerprints,\" said Theirry Lusenge, a key member of ZSL's survey team in the DRC. \"We have already identified three individuals, and further survey work will enable us to estimate population numbers and distribution in and around the park, which is a critical first step in targeting conservation efforts.\" ZSL said the images prove the okapi still thrives in the park despite threats to its survival, which include poaching, deforestation, military camps inside the park, and the influx of refugees at the park's borders. The animal's exact status is still a mystery, however, and it remains under threat, the ZSL said. Okapi meat reportedly poached from the park is now regularly on sale at the nearby town of Beni -- and if hunting continues at the same rate, okapi could become extinct within the park within a few years, the ZSL said. The Virunga National Park is one of only three protected areas the okapi are known to inhabit, the ZSL said. The ZSL's study of the okapi is part of a larger EU-funded conservation project in the park. Though focused on okapi, the study has also managed to find other species including shrews and duikers, a kind of antelope, a ZSL spokeswoman said. The study involved 18 cameras set up around the park by the ZSL and the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation, the spokeswoman said. The announcement comes a month after another group of researchers reported finding thousands of previously-unknown gorillas in the neighboring Republic of Congo. The U.S.-based Wildlife Conservation Society said in August they had found 125,000 Western lowland gorillas living in a swamp in northern Congo, adding significantly to the existing worldwide population of the threatened species. Okapi were well known by Africans for centuries but the animal remained elusive, thanks to its acute hearing and effective camouflage, according to The National Zoological Gardens of South Africa. Nineteenth-century explorers sometimes caught a fleeting glimpse of the okapi's striped backside as it ran through the forest, leading to speculation that it was a kind of zebra, the National Zoological Gardens says. It was known to the pygmy as a sacred animal. Still, the okapi remained unknown to the Western world until the early 20th century, when British explorer Harry Johnston went to Congo and sent a complete skin and skull back to Britain, the ZSL said.", "2f32a9eebbfa707a264d82a3bef5557f6b3b5f20": "(CNN) -- Two Russian bombers have landed at a Venezuelan airfield where they will carry out training flights for several days, the Russian defense ministry said Wednesday. Russia's Tupolev TU-160, pictured here in 2003, is a long-range strategic bomber. The Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bombers landed at Venezuela's Libertador military airfield and \"will spend several days carrying out training flights over neutral waters, after which they will return to the base,\" the ministry added. NATO fighters followed the bombers on their 13-hour flight over the Arctic Ocean and the Atlantic, the defense ministry said. It said the Russian flights were carried out in strict accordance with international rules governing airspace above neutral waters, and that the aircraft did not violate the borders of other states. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said such joint exercises between nations are not unusual. \"We exercise all around the globe and have joint exercises with countries all over the world. So do many other nations.\" The U.S. will monitor the Russian-Venezuelan training, said Pentagon officials who asked not to be identified as they are not authorized to speak on the information. On Monday, Russia announced it might hold joint naval maneuvers with Venezuela in the Caribbean. The declaration came amid increased tension between Russia and the United States over Russia's invasion last month of the former Soviet republic of Georgia, a U.S. ally that aspires to join NATO. On Monday Russia denied any link between that announcement and the conflict in Georgia, although Russia has criticized U.S. support for Georgia. Russia has also objected to the missile defense system agreement, signed between the United States and Poland and the Czech Republic in August, that places a ground-based ballistic defense facility in the two eastern European nations. Russia has said the deal threatens its security, while the United States has said that the system is to guard against rogue states such as Iran. Earlier this month, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, whose comments have frequently antagonized Washington, said it would welcome the Russian air force, according to Russian news agency Novosti. \"If Russian long-range bombers should need to land in Venezuela, we would not object to that either.

Reese Witherspoon says she wants to banish the myth that young women are not at risk for breast cancer. (CNN) -- Every three minutes in the United States, a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. As a woman, a mother, and a daughter, I find that statistic terrifying. I was never na\u00efve about breast cancer, but hearing this statistic put it all into perspective.   Women close to me have battled the disease and are now soldiers in the greater fight against it. But the moment I heard \"every three minutes,\" I felt vulnerable and scared as I realized that anyone is susceptible. The only way for me to ease my fears was to take action. I needed to educate myself and others on this disease. As the Honorary Chair for the Avon Foundation, I had resources at my fingertips. I had access to an entire organization that is dedicated to giving back to women and educating people. So I started asking, \"What do I need to know?\" It was through that curiosity that I found out the most important fact in breast cancer: Early detection saves lives. According to the Avon Foundation Breast Cancer Crusade, there is a 97 percent five-year survival rate when breast cancer is caught before it spreads to other parts of the body. When breast cancer first develops, there are usually no symptoms, which is why women need to perform self-exams regularly and contact their doctor upon noticing even the smallest change. Of course talking about breast cancer and breast health is a personal thing. I too am a private person but encourage all women to break through their reservations and talk to their doctors and physicians. We must also banish the myth that young women are not at risk for breast cancer. At the Avon Walk in Washington, I met young survivors who were diagnosed in their 20s, an age when most women are graduating from college and just starting their lives as full adults.  Watch Reese and Larry at the Avon Walk \u00bb . Women in their 20s and 30s should have a clinical breast exam by a health professional at least once every three years and women 40 and older should have an exam every year. I am passionate about fighting this devastating disease. I fight for my mother, myself, my children and future generations of women, so one day we will not have to be afraid of breast cancer. I began my fight by learning important first steps in breast cancer detection, and will not end my fight until every woman can stand together saying we are breast cancer free. More than anything else, I have faith -- faith we will find a cure. I saw this commitment in the faces of the women in Washington -- in the faces of the women walking and the women and men who stood on the sidelines encouraging the 3,500 participants to the finish line. I was cheering right along with them, screaming for action to find a cure.

Minutes after police responded to the call reporting an injured person and found Burk, they found a car -- which turned out to be Burk's -- on fire in a campus parking lot. Dawson told reporters Friday that authorities think gasoline or another accelerant was used to ignite Burk's car, and police were investigating whether a gas can found in downtown Auburn was connected. Police want to investigate every possible lead, Dawson said. Authorities were still on patrol in the east Alabama campus, he said. The university's Web site said a campus-wide memorial service will be held Monday. The site carried a message from Burk's father, James, which said: \"The Burk family was so proud to have Lauren as an Auburn University student. We want to extend our deepest gratitude and appreciation for Auburn University, the city of Auburn and the Auburn Police Department. We feel very close to your community. We appreciate what everyone is doing for us and Lauren.\" Also on Friday, police released pictures of a 2001 Honda Civic similar to Burk's car. Authorities asked anyone who thinks they might have seen the car on Tuesday to contact them. Police are continuing to interview people, Dawson said. A student at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill -- Eve Carson, 22, of Athens, Georgia -- was also shot to death this week, on early Wednesday. Authorities in Chapel Hill said Friday they had been in contact with Auburn police but did not believe the two cases were connected.   Watch CNN's Nancy Grace discuss the two killings of college women from Georgia \u00bb . Burk's family, in a statement read Friday to reporters by family friend Kathy Singleton, expressed their gratitude for the thoughts and prayers offered, but asked for privacy \"so that they may grieve for their loss as well as celebrate Lauren's life.\" Those wishing to honor Burk could do so by donating to her favorite charities, Singleton said -- The Invisible Child and the American Kidney Foundation.

It's wild,\" she said. \"Everybody's rushing and panicking. I could have stayed, but I thought it was best to just get out of there.\" Morgan said it took her about five hours to make the 200 mile drive to San Antonio -- a trip that normally only takes about three hours. Ike is expected to make landfall on the Gulf Coast of Texas, which is home to many of the country's oil refineries. That's led to a scramble at gas stations as people try to fill up before the storm hits. iReport.com: Are you in Ike's path? People were filling up their cars and their gas cans at a Sam's Club in College Station, Texas, iReporter Kyle Norton told CNN.com. \"The lines were a tad ridiculous,\" the 30-year-old banker said. Norton said his 2002 Dodge Ram pickup was on empty, so he had no choice but to wait in line for an hour. Despite the long lines, Norton said gas was about $3.49, which is pretty normal for the area. He said a friend had to go to four different stations before he could find one that still had regular unleaded. iReporter Jeremy \"Clete\" Terrell said the lines also were long at the Costco in Alpharetta, Georgia. \"I was getting gas and realized that everybody else was too,\" he said. iReporter Curtis McNeely said a Kangaroo Express station in Evansville, Indiana, imposed a 10 gallon limit. \"It's causing paranoia more than anything,\"  he said adding that people are returning to the gas station to fill up multiple times. A spokeswoman for the company that runs the Kangaroo Express chain says it's imposed a limit at its 1,660 stores because gas supplies are tight. Several stations in Ocala, Florida, were limiting sales if they still had gas to sell, iReporter Christine Bailey said. Canadian Ian McIntosh said gas prices jumped 57 cents per gallon overnight in Milton, Ontario. \"This stuff's in the tanks, it's just sitting in the gas stations, they're using this as a windfall event,\" the retired teacher said. McIntosh said he heard prices were going up on the news, so he and his wife got gas last night -- along with many other residents of the Toronto suburb. \"A gas station that would normally have three or four cars -- you had 15 cars and you had to line up to get to the pumps,\" he said. Rumors that gas would jump to $6 a gallon caused a panic in Sylva, North Carolina. iReport.com: Police called in at mountain gas station .

A U.S. soldier on patrol in Ramadi's market earlier this year. U.S. troops will remain in the province to support Iraqi forces. President George W. Bush described the transfer as a major victory against al-Qaeda extremists who once held sway in the area. \"Today, Anbar is no longer lost to al Qaeda -- it is al Qaeda that lost Anbar,\" he said in a statement. Once dominated by Sunni insurgents, Anbar has been the scene of many attacks on U.S.-led troops in Iraq. Now a bastion of tribal opposition, it is also the scene of an internal Sunni political struggle between the Iraqi Islamic Party, one of Iraq's main Sunni parties, and the Awakening movement, the first anti-al Qaeda in Iraq movement established in the country. More than 25,000 U.S. troops serve in the sprawling Anbar province west of Baghdad; most of them Marines. They will remain for the time being but will shift their mission to supporting Iraqi forces, when needed . The transfer is a \"major progress\" for all of Iraq, said Brigadier Gen. David Perkins, the spokesman for the Multi-National Force in Iraq. The transfer ceremony took place in Ramadi, the capital of the western province, and was attended by Iraqi officials and U.S. military brass.  Watch U.S., Iraqi officials perform transfer \u00bb . \"We are all well aware of what the security situation was in Anbar even a year ago,\" Perkins said. \"And the fact that that has been able to be turned around, that the Iraqi citizens that live there want to stand up on their own, [that] they want to take control of the province on their own ... it's a major progress not only for Anbar, but for all of Iraq.\" Anbar is the 11th of Iraq's 18 provinces to revert to local security control, but is the first Sunni-dominated one. The move comes amid a big drop in violence in Iraq and calls from Iraqis for the United States to come up with a troop withdrawal timetable. The other provinces that have transitioned to Iraqi security control are Duhuk, Irbil and Sulaimaniya in the Kurdish region, and Karbala, Najaf, Qadisiya, Muthanna, Thiqar, Basra, and Maysan in the Shiite south.

Robert and Melissa Rogers with their four children before they died in August 2003. Rainfall from a torrential downpour swept the Rogers' minivan off a Kansas highway. As water filled the van, Rogers kicked out a window in a last-ditch effort to save his family. Instead, he and his wife, Melissa, and daughter, Makenah, were sucked out of the van. Hours later, the bodies of children Zachary, 5, Nicholas, 3, and Alenah, 1, still buckled in their car seats, were found inside the van. Rogers survived. Instead of falling into despair, he became a minister dedicated to honoring his family by preaching messages of hope in the face of adversity. \"It was a huge choice of faith,\" Rogers told CNN. \"It was a determination to live life to honor God, to honor my heavenly family, and to make something productive out of it and not just to wallow in my pity.\"  Watch the story of the Rogers family tragedy \u00bb . Rogers' mission manifests itself in a variety of ways. In the past five years, he estimates he has told the story of his loss at least 400 times to more than 120,000 people. The message behind his story is to live life with no regrets by embracing your family and faith. \"People have responded to me that they want to change the way they live their life. They want to have a personal relationship with God and they want to get right with their spouse and children,\" he said. In addition to his speaking tours, Rogers has established a ministry dedicated to serving orphans across the world. Rogers also traveled to Haiti and tsunami-ravaged parts of Asia to minister and deliver aid to orphans.  Watch Rogers talk about his ministry \u00bb . His mission is to establish five orphanages in five continents to symbolize the five family members he lost. One, called Melissa's House, already exists in Russia, where eight orphan teens live with a married couple, and another is under construction in Rwanda. \"We dedicated it in honor of Melissa because she loved being a mom and I hope she is a role model to these girls,\" Rogers said. Since that fateful day five years ago, Rogers has begun to heal. He is married with one child and another on the way. More than anything, he hopes his story will inspire others to live each day to its fullest. \"We are not guaranteed the next five seconds,\" Rogers said. \"Life is very fragile and I hope my stories and inspirations are compelling people to live that life of no regrets.\" CNN's Kyra Phillips contributed to this report .", "79d625a3311f4ff11598a3ae4fca63103e84e9a1": "MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- Members of a Russian doomsday cult barricaded themselves in a cave to wait out the end of the world as the cult's leader underwent psychiatric exams Thursday, Russian media reported. The cult, which calls itself the \"true Russian Orthodox Church,\" believes the world will end in May. The cult leader is in police custody awaiting proceedings on charges that he set up an organization \"whose activity is associated with violence on citizens and instigation to refuse to perform their civil duties,\" according to the state-funded Itar-Tass news agency. Four children are among 29 cult members holed up in a ravine in Russia's Penza region, where they apparently dug a cave. One of the children in the cave is 18 months old, reported Itar-Tass. Temperatures in the cave are below 54 degrees Fahrenheit (12 degrees Celsius), the Russian news agency reported. The cult members have refused law enforcement requests to come out or release the children, and they have threatened to commit suicide if police resort to force, according to Russian state television. The cult, which calls itself the \"true Russian Orthodox Church,\" believes the end of the world will come in May 2008. Prosecutors announced Thursday they are opening criminal proceedings against the cult's leader, Father Pyotr Kuznetsov. Kuznetsov, 43, is \"under the supervision of investigators,\" Olig Troshin, a Penza prosecutor, told Itar-Tass.

Officials of the breakaway Georgian region said the shelling was part of a Georgian military operation, Interfax reported. Georgia initially suggested Russian peacekeepers were to blame, drawing heated denials from the Russian Defense Ministry, which called the allegation \"dirty informational provocation.\" Later, however, Mamuka Kurashvili, the commander of Georgian peacekeeping operations, told reporters that four people were wounded when several Georgian villages were fired upon from South Ossetia, and Georgia \"had to return fire.\" Women, children and the elderly were being evacuated from the conflict zone because of fears that Georgia would continue military operations against the region, according to the South Ossetian Information and Press Committee as reported by Interfax. South Ossetia's government held a special session on the violence, the Russian news agency said. \"If Georgia continues provocative actions, we will announce the recruitment of volunteers not only in the North Ossetia but in the entire North Caucasus and also carry out general mobilization in South Ossetia,\" South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity told Interfax. Georgia, located on the Black Sea coast between Russia and Turkey, has been split by Russian-backed separatist movements in South Ossetia and another region, Abkhzia. Accusations often fly on both sides, and the South Ossetian leadership has alleged that Georgian troops stage attacks to create a pretext for military action. South Ossetia declared its independence from Georgia in the early 1990s after a bloody war there between ethnic Georgians and Ossetians. The region's independence is not internationally recognized. Russian, Georgian and South Ossetian troops participate in a mixed peacekeeping force there and have maintained a fragile peace broken occasionally by fighting. On Friday, as reports of the shelling began, Russia expressed \"its most serious concern about the escalation of tensions in South Ossetia.\" Moscow said it was taking measures to prevent escalation of the conflict as it urged both Georgia and South Ossetia to look for diplomatic ways to calm the situation.", "851d02b689bec14607574096bb77b9acf53c15ee": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's inflation rate has soared in the past three months and is now at 11.2 million percent, the highest in the world, according to the country's Central Statistical Office. Zimbabwe's inflation rate has soared to a world high. Official figures dated Monday show inflation has surged from the rate of 2.2 million percent recorded in May, despite the government's price controls. The country's finance minister confirmed the new figure in an interview but said the rising inflation rate was not confined to Zimbabwe alone. \"While our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the Western powers, rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of bio-fuel,\" said Samuel Mumbengegwi. \"But we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic.\" In February, the price of a loaf of bread in the country was less than 200,000 Zimbabwe dollars. On Monday, that same loaf of bread cost 1.6 trillion Zimbabwe dollars. Analysts have said the Zimbabwean government's official inflation rate figures are conservative. Last week, one of Zimbabwe's leading banks, Kingdom Bank, said the country's inflation rate was now more than 20 million percent. The locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for Zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment in an economy that has been in freefall for almost a decade. Once considered the breadbasket of Africa, Zimbabwe has been in the throes of an economic meltdown ever since the country embarked on a chaotic land reform program that has decimated commercial agriculture. Analysts say the crisis has worsened following President Robert Mugabe's disputed reelection in the June 27 presidential run-off. His challenger Morgan Tsvangirai boycotted the race over widespread allegations of violence and voter intimidation. The economic crisis has destroyed Zimbabwe's currency and made it difficult for Zimbabweans to buy basic commodities, electricity, fuel, and medicines. Many Zimbabweans have left the country amid rising unemployment and deepening poverty. Last week a summit in South Africa of regional African leaders failed to persuade Zimbabwe's political parties to agree to form a government of national unity, which observers view as the best way to end Zimbabwe's record recession.", "f2d00c8c396698becc18fd2b41ba595c7a3e1cc6": "(Oprah.com) -- On any given day here at \"O, The Oprah Magazine,\" there are somewhere in the neighborhood of 69 very talented, extremely detail oriented, high-energy, hardworking women and men all doing their jobs and doing them well. I love a few of them, I like a lot of them, I despise one of them. She is the Magneto to my Wolverine, the Saruman to my Frodo, the Dr. Octopus to my Spiderman. I call her The Tinkler. It's a typical Tuesday; the office is humming along. I'm answering e-mails, writing cover lines, scheduling a dental appointment here, partial highlights there, kicking myself for not getting sushi at lunch. The sun is shining, the color printer is working -- my life is good. I mosey into the ladies' room, glance at the mirror, remind myself that fluorescent lights make everyone look as if they're in the final stages of tuberculosis, and head for a stall. And then I see it: The seat, even the floor, is covered in little yellow droplets. The Tinkler strikes again. To date, I have been able to deduce only four things about her: . 1. She is female. 2. She attacks between the hours of 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. 3. She works alone. 4. She was raised in a barn. I've been her victim more times than I can count, and it has turned me from a happy-go-lucky columnist into a bitter, paranoid germaphobe. She has become the bane of my existence. We live in a world where our soldiers lack sufficient body armor, where Rupert Murdoch is blurring the line intended to keep the business and political interests of media owners from influencing the presentation of news, where the White House still refuses to respond to questions they promised to answer as soon as the Scooter Libby case was closed, where studies indicate that worrying you're going to get sick will actually get you sick -- and yet I am devoting an entire column to The Tinkler. Any shrink worth his or her salt will tell you that it is a mistake to think of your colleagues as family. But what is a family if not a group of people who care about you and irritate you and show up for cake on your birthday and look at pictures of your kid even when they don't feel like it and think it wouldn't kill you to put on a little makeup and a pair of heels once in a while? I've been earning a paycheck for 30 years. Whether rinsing conditioner off a Lhasa apso during my stint as shampoo girl at Mr. Whiskers Pet Boutique or breathing on the chicken breast I was about to serve a rude diner during my waitressing days, I've always found that the people I work with matter to me. Their moods, their opinions, their style influence my life. They've appreciated me, humiliated me, surprised me, and antagonized me. I've gotten flowers and I've gotten fired (and I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything to deserve either), but I've never experienced anything like The Tinkler. \"Dammit!\" I say upon encountering her latest Jackson Pollock imitation. Pat, Suzan, and Valerie each come out of their stalls to see what's wrong. I point in horror. Pat groans, Suzan moans, Val throws up her hands in disgust, and we fall into silence. Then I rally, \"At least we know it's not one of us.\" But everybody else is a suspect. \"It can't be Sudie,\" Suzan volunteers. My eyes narrow. \"What are you basing this on?\" I ask. \"I've seen her,\" she answers, \"she always heads straight for the paper seat protector.\" \"And,\" Valerie adds, \"we can cross Mamie off the list -- it happened twice while she was in Sweden.\" Sixty seconds ago, the four of us were editors; now we are FBI profilers. \"She probably likes to burrow into small spaces,\" Pat conjectures. \"This never happens in the big, wheelchair-accessible stall ...\" \"It's very primitive, as if she's marking her territory. This is clearly a hostile gesture,\" Suzan declares with authority. We're finally getting somewhere. \"So, really,\" I say, \"we just need to be on the lookout for an aggressively mean-spirited, mole-like cavewoman who is not confined to a wheelchair .. is that right?\" Val is the first to realize that we're losing our minds. \"I'm out of here,\" she says, and exits the ladies' room. Later, I complain to J.J., poor, naive little J.J .. She tells me that it can't be any of us, that the toilet is somehow to blame. I leave J.J. in her special world -- a place where troubles melt like lemon drops and Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone -- and resume writing my column. Gina drops by and reads over my shoulder. Suddenly she has an epiphany: \"It's you!\" she announces, pointing at me like she's Javert accusing Jean Valjean of stealing silver candlesticks. \"Think about it,\" she says. \"What better way to cover your tracks than writing an outraged piece on the subject?\" I kind of like that Gina believes I am an evil genius, and I don't have the heart to tell her that I once refused to sit my daughter on the lap of a department store Santa Claus because I had no idea who else had been sitting there. Another day, another bathroom break. \"Steer clear of the third stall,\" Yeun warns as she dries her hands and heads for a meeting. Jennifer emerges from door number four to see what exactly's going on behind door number three. She is appalled yet philosophical. \"Believe it or not, every place I've ever worked has had a Tinkler -- maybe sharing a ladies' room just sends certain people into a passive-aggressive snit. It's the dark side of office life.\" Lately, my daydreams bear a striking resemblance to one of those black-and-white Sherlock Holmes movies: The entire team sits, sipping brandy in an ornate drawing room. \"I suppose you're wondering why I've gathered you here today,\" I begin in an inexplicable British accent. \"Well, my friends, one of you is The Tinkler.\" The research department averts their eyes. The art department fidgets nervously. An intern gasps. \"And,\" I go on, \"nobody is leaving this room until I reveal the person who refuses to work and play well with others.\" My assistant, Polly, looks up. \"You mean you've figured out the identity of The Tinkler?\" she asks, filled with an admiration for my powers of reasoning that she has never once expressed in real life. \"It was elementary, dear Watson. I merely -- \" but before I can unmask The Tinkler or explain why I refer to Polly as dear Watson, the lights suddenly go out ... I could go on, but I'm bored silly whenever someone feels compelled to relay every nanosecond of a dream. Suffice it to say that I usually wind up in the arms of Tyrone Power. As for The Tinkler? She's still on the lam. There are lots of days when I find myself wishing life were closer to a gorgeous movie from the '40s -- women wore fabulous hats and pearl chokers, and I don't think they actually went to the bathroom back then. They were too busy dancing with Fred Astaire and smoking unfiltered cigarettes to schlep to an office every day. Now, some of us are running the offices, but it seems we've brought a few low-grade lunatics along for the ride -- and they're wreaking havoc in the ladies' room. Where have you gone, Edith Wharton? I'm not asking for cloth napkins and classical music. I don't need a mint on my pillow.

Vicki Minor's Wildland Firefighter Foundation has granted more than $1.5 million in aid to more than 500 families. As he lay in his hospital bed in Sacramento, California, Vicki Minor put her hand on his shoulder. \"She introduced herself and told me that she was there to help,\" recalls Frohreich, who had been in a helicopter crash that killed nine of his colleagues. \"She just said, 'Anything.' She was there to do anything for me.\" Since 1999, Minor has dedicated herself to providing emergency assistance and ongoing support to injured and fallen wildfire fighters and their families nationwide through her Wildland Firefighter Foundation. Wildland firefighters are called into action when the United States' vast natural resources are threatened by fire. For Frohreich, Minor's foundation supplied lodging and food for family and friends who visited his bedside. It also provided emergency funds for medical and other expenses, arranged for Frohreich to meet with firefighters who carried him to safety, and brought his fallen comrades' family members to a bereavement ceremony. \"She means everything,\" Frohreich said. \"She's one of the best things to ever happen.\" Minor first became involved with the wildland firefighter community 21 years ago after witnessing a wildfire for the first time. \"I had never seen anything like it,\" Minor recalls of the blaze in the mountains of Idaho. \"All those firefighter units mobilized in camps that cropped up. It was like an invasion, and I was mesmerized.\" Minor started a fire camp commissary, providing dry goods, clothing and necessities to the firefighters. But it wasn't until tragedy struck in 1994 at Storm King Mountain, Colorado, where 14 firefighters perished in a single day, that Minor was overcome with a need to assist the families. The Storm King fire was a turning point. \"Fighting fire is much like fighting a war. There's no time to tend to the injured, or tend to the dead. The fire doesn't stop raging,\" Minor said. \"I looked up at the heavens and I said to those kids, 'Help me help your families.' \" Grieving wildland families, like those of fallen soldiers, tend to be young and scattered throughout the country, often enduring their sudden loss in isolation from their firefighting community. Taking cues from a visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., Minor spearheaded fundraising efforts for the erection of the Wildland Firefighters Monument in Boise, Idaho, which contains markers \"for almost every wildland firefighter that has fallen,\" Minor said. \"I had seen and felt the healing of those combat veterans that would touch a name of their friend,\" Minor said. \"Our wildland firefighters had nothing like that to process their grief. I wanted to create a place where our families could congregate, reach out in solidarity and comfort to honor their fallen and injured.\"  Watch Minor describe the sculptures in the firefighter monument \u00bb . Since 1999, the foundation has continued to grow, assisting more than 500 wildland firefighters and their families with more than $1.5 million in emergency funds and services, including communication support; travel and lodging for the injured and fallen; and emotional and benefit counseling and advocacy.  Watch Minor describe how her foundation takes action to aid wildfire fighters \u00bb . \"There is a need for these families to be taken care of, and a long-term need,\" Minor said. \"But most of it is to maintain that home until benefits come in.\" When survivors suddenly lose their income and don't know how to apply for the compensation they're entitled to, Minor's foundation steps in to guide them, often fighting for them when benefits are delayed or denied.  Watch Minor explain why her foundation fights for firefighters and their families \u00bb . Minor says she hopes the wildland firefighters know \"we have their back.\" \"I hope that they feel they can go on and fight that fire and know that we'll take care of their family and their friends.\"", "86eaa90c419d5ed93341248fecd8c25d820f2b82": "(CNN) -- The New York Giants' unlikely win over the New England Patriots is already being called one of the biggest shockers in Super Bowl history, and the amazing catch David Tyree made to set up the game-winning touchdown won't be forgotten anytime soon. Pint-sized Giants fans, Luka and Kristian Radovich, celebrate after Plaxico Burress' game-winning catch. CNN.com reader Michael Heitman, of Baxter, Tennessee, will remember Super Bowl XLII for more than the 17-14 score. \"Our 13-month-old daughter took her first steps during the second half. Apparently, so did the Giants offense. Congrats to the Giants from a Cowboys fan,\" he said. David Marks, of Duquesne, Pennsylvania, said it was \"one of the best football games I'd ever seen,\" but said watching the game with his family had some drawbacks. \"I was not able to enjoy the commercials as much because my mom wouldn't stop yakking away,\" he said. \"She's 80 years old and I didn't want to say anything at first -- you don't know how much longer you have your mom at that age.

Russell Giuliano of Middletown, New Jersey I have seen every Super Bowl, and this was the best ever, even better than No. 3 with Namath. Dave Viscusi of Schenectady, New York That was one of the best Super Bowls/Super Bowl parties I have ever been to. We made 4 different kinds of pizza (BBQ chicken, cheese, sausage and peppers), boneless buffalo wings, BBQ ribs, chips of all kinds, apple martinis, some beer and topped off the Giants victory with some CHAMPAGNE! GO G-Men ... Eli deserves every ounce of credit he gets for this Super Bowl ... Way to throw it right in the arrogant Patriots' face! Ricardo Gomez of Buenos Aires, Argentina I'm a big Pats fan, and I was sad to see that last play when Manning escapes the Pats' defense and throw that pass, the one that put the GIANTS OFFENSE so close to the touchdown. Anyway, I think Pats are still the best team in the league, and I was there that snowy night when Brady got us to the Super Bowl at the last second with (Adam Vinatieri kicking) that amazing field goal! So GO PATS! GO!!! Irving Horowitz of Princeton, New Jersey There are three sport moments in my life that I will take to my grave with a broad grin and deep pleasure: The first was the Bobby Thompson home run for the New York (Baseball) Giants in 1951 to defeat the Dodgers; a varsity game while I was at Hobart & William Smith when, as a member of the faculty and staff, we defeated a first-class varsity team in 1962 and I made the winning basket with 28 seconds on the clock (I have the press clippings to prove this); and the biggest thrill of them all: Watching the New York (Football) Giants win Super Bowl XLII against the New England Patriots. When Bob Tisch spoke of \"this win is for all Giant fans who, for the past 30 years, supported the team at Giants Stadium, and before that at the Yankee Stadium, and for those who still remember being part of the Giants at the Polo Grounds,\" I felt that he spoke directly to me. After all, I am actually about a year or two older than the franchise ... Wow! 2008 is already a good year -- a good omen for America. Monique Mondesire of Bronx, New York I'm a 26-year-old female who really doesn't put much thought into sports, but that was the best Super Bowl game I have ever seen in my life. I had faith that it would happen, but the way it happened was priceless. I'm very proud to be a New Yorker and a new Giants fan. To all the New Yorkers that lost their bets yesterday, in the words of Don Corleone, \"Never go against the family.\" Lisa Ciacci of Brooklyn, New York As a die-hard Cowboys fan, I may have been the most unlikely N.Y. Giants fan last night. I could not be happier for this team. They played their hearts out in quite possibly the best game I have ever watched.

Police officers chase away a protester in Mangalore, India, Monday. By Tuesday, about 20 deaths had been reported, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police in the worst-affected Kandhamal district. The latest casualty is a police officer who died after an armed mob of about 400 to 500 mostly Hindus torched a police station in the district on Monday, Orissa state police said. Orissa's Director General of Police G.C. Nanda the policeman died when the mob opened fire at officers fleeing the burning building. The attack, he said, may have been in retaliation for arrests that police made in the ongoing communal fighting.  Watch more about the riots in India \u00bb . The attack came two days after police fired on a crowd to prevent it from attacking Christian residents. Between three and six people died in the shooting, CNN's sister network CNN-IBN reported. The violence spread to southern India over the weekend when vandals attacked 14 churches in an hour in the state of Karnataka Sunday, the network said. The Christian community in the Karnataka -- numbering about 2.5 million -- said right-wing Hindus are targeting them for opposing the violence in Orissa. By Tuesday, police had arrested about 140 people in connection with the riots, said Karnataka's Inspector General of Police A.M. Prasad. Sixty of them -- all Hindus -- were arrested for the church attacks, Prasad said. The rest, mostly Christians, were charged with disturbing the peace, he said. Orissa has historically been a tinderbox of Hindu-Christian tensions. Some Hindu groups view the work of Christian missionaries in the state with suspicion. They accuse missionaries of bribing or forcing Hindus into converting. The seeds for the current conflict were planted on August 23, when Hindu leader, Laxmananda Saraswati, and four others were killed in Kandhamal after 20 to 30 gunmen barged into a Hindu school and began shooting, the Orissa chief minister's office said. The authorities have not determined who killed Saraswati, but after the incident they detained five people who are Christians, said Sukanta Panda, spokesman for the chief minister. The government says the killings may have been the work of Maoist rebels -- investigators have many unanswered questions -- but some hardline Hindus blamed a Christian minority. They took to the streets in anger, rampaging through predominantly Christian neighborhoods, ransacking shops and torching houses. They chopped down trees to block roads, making it difficult for police to reach trouble spots. A Christian orphanage was set on fire. A 20-year-old woman, who was teaching children inside, burned to death. Christian residents fought back, and the clashes spread. Authorities imposed a night curfew in many towns and deployed state and federal forces in the troubled areas, Kumar -- the police superintendent -- said. Both sides said the violence has left Christian churches and Hindu temples razed to the ground. This is not the first time the simmering anger has boiled over in the state with deadly consequences. In 1999, a Hindu mob burned to death an Australian missionary, Graham Staines, and his two children while they slept inside their car. And last Christmas, clashing groups killed four people and burned several churches in the same Orissa district -- Kandhamal. Maoist rebels, who claim to be fighting for the poor and the dispossessed, have been battling the Indian government in an insurgency that has resulted in thousands of casualties since the late 1960s. Some Christians accept the Maoist theory, saying the rebels have also struck against hard-line Hindus because they associate them as being closely aligned with the government. But Hindu groups insists that Christians were behind Saraswati's death. Unlike Orissa, Karnataka has until now been spared the large-scale clash between Christians and Hindus. But now, many in the Christian community fear their calm and prosperous state may become another battleground between the two religions, CNN-IBN said.

Bill and Hillary Clinton campaign in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, on Monday. The article, by Vanity Fair magazine's national editor Todd Purdum, suggested that Bill Clinton's personality had changed since his 2004 heart bypass surgery and said that there were reports of Clinton \"seeing a lot of women on the road.\" Purdum quoted four anonymous former Clinton aides saying that another of his former assistants had conducted \"what one of these aides called an intervention\" about the reports of philandering. A writer for the Huffington Post, Mayhill Fowler, asked Clinton on Monday what he thought \"about that hatchet job somebody did on you in Vanity Fair,\" according to a recording of the exchange posted on the Huffington Post's Web site.  Listen to Clinton call the reporter a \"scumbag\" \u00bb . \"[He's] sleazy,\" Clinton responded. \"He's a really dishonest reporter.\" Clinton said he had not read the article but that he was told that \"there's five or six just blatant lies in there.

Late Monday, Jay Carson, a spokesman for Hillary Clinton's campaign, said that \"President Clinton was understandably upset about an outrageously unfair article, but the language today was inappropriate and he wishes he had not used it.\" Purdum, a former New York Times reporter who covered the Clinton White House and is now married to former Clinton press secretary Dee Dee Myers, defended his article on CNN's \"The Situation Room\" Monday. He told CNN's Wolf Blitzer he was \"very careful to say there is no clear-cut evidence that President Clinton has done anything improper.\"  Watch CNN's Wolf Blitzer interview Purdum \u00bb . \"I reject the notion that I'm making an insinuation,\" Purdum said. \"But I'm very comfortable quoting the people I quote because I know who they are, and I know that they are very senior people who have known President Clinton for a very long time and work for him at very high levels.\" In his article, Purdum quotes a Johns Hopkins cardiologist -- who was not involved in Clinton's health care -- who says that the former president's bypass surgery could have affected his mood, perhaps even causing depression. And on CNN, Purdum quoted \"some people who work for him\" saying that Clinton \"seems to be angry all the time.\" Purdum added he himself believes there's evidence the former president is acting in a different manner. \"I think there's a good deal of evidence that he is quite a bit angrier than he used to be,\" he said. \"He's clearly very angry at the media, and he's very angry at the way he sees Sen. Clinton's campaign has been treated.\" \"I don't suggest that anyone can say -- except perhaps his own doctors over time -- with certainty that [the surgery] has affected President Clinton,\" he said. \"But again, this article involves reporting with a whole bunch of people who have worked for Bill Clinton over many years. And this is one of the things they raised with me. I didn't go raising this.\" Clinton's office issued a rebuttal of Purdum's article that decried his use of \"one doctor who has never examined President Clinton.\" \"This theory is false and is flatly rejected by President Clinton's doctors who say he is in excellent shape and point to his vigorous schedule as evidence of his exceptional recovery,\" the rebuttal said.  Watch analyst James Carville's take on the article \u00bb . The lengthy article hits newsstands later this week, though Vanity Fair has already posted a copy on its Web site. The posting prompted a blistering response from Carson, who called the piece \"journalism of personal destruction at its worst.\" \"A tawdry, anonymous quote-filled attack piece, published in this month's Vanity Fair magazine regarding former President Bill Clinton repeats many past attacks on him, ignores much prior positive coverage, includes numerous errors, and ultimately breaks no new ground,\" he said.

Prince William and his father, Prince Charles, at his graduation from the Royal Air Force in April. William, 25, will spend the first part of his attachment on a basic sea safety course training in sea survival, firefighting and ship damage repair, according to the ministry. If William passes the course, as expected, he will join the HMS Iron Duke in the Caribbean, the department said. The ship's function is to support overseas British territories in the event of a hurricane and to carry out counter-narcotic operations. The prince, who will be called Sub Lieutenant Wales in the Navy, is expected to spend time aboard a frigate, a mine hunter, a submarine and helicopters during his attachment, which ends August 1, the Ministry of Defense said. William completed a four-month attachment with the Royal Air Force this year and received his pilot's wings upon graduating in April. He learned to fly three different aircraft during the attachment and is known as Flying Officer Wales within the RAF. William is also a second lieutenant in the British Army, where he serves in the Blues and Royals regiment of the Household Cavalry. The attachments are designed to provide the prince with military experience for when he becomes head of the armed forces as king. \"When he becomes king, he needs to know his armed forces -- instinctively be very familiar with them -- and so he is doing this visit to the Royal Navy,\" said Rear Adm. Bob Cooling, the assistant chief of naval staff. William's father, Prince Charles, had a five-year career in the navy in the 1970s. Charles served on the guided missile destroyer HMS Norfolk and two frigates before qualifying as a helicopter pilot and joining a naval air squadron that operated from the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes. Prince Charles spent his last nine months in the navy in 1976 in command of the coastal minehunter HMS Bronington. William's uncle Prince Andrew served 22 years in the Royal Navy as a helicopter pilot, seeing active service during the Falklands War between Britain and Argentina in 1982.

Mathis, a military veteran himself, was seething with anger Thursday as he spoke about the death of Army Staff Sgt. Darris J. Dawson. An unnamed U.S. soldier is accused of killing Army Staff Sgt. Darris J. Dawson in Iraq on Sunday. Dawson, and Sgt. Wesley Durbin, 26, are said to have been shot and killed by another U.S. soldier on Sunday at a base south of Baghdad. Darryl and his wife, Maxine (Dawson's stepmother), say the military has told them nothing about the incident: no details on his death, no information at all. His voice shakes as he says he believes that the military has let him down. \"I'm very disappointed -- very,\" he said. \"If I would get a straight answer, if they would actually tell me what's going on, I would have something to work on; but right now, I have nothing to work on. Everything I'm getting, I'm getting from the media.\" His wife sobs as she says her stepson's death was foreshadowed by a phone call he made to her from Iraq. \"He said that he was more shaky sometimes of the soldiers than of the enemy, because of the young guys over there.\" She said she asked him, \"What in the world do you mean? You're afraid of your own soldiers?\" \" 'These kids are trying to fight a war they know nothing about. ... They're jumpy. ... They're more scary than the enemy,' \" she said he told her. \"And I said, 'Oh, God,' \" said Maxine Mathis. On any given day, CNN receives dozens of detailed news releases from the U.S. military, including those announcing U.S. military casualties. In the cases of Dawson and Durbin, there was no mention of their names, and the releases were terse. \"A multi-national division center soldier died this morning of non-combat related causes,\" the first release read. \"The cause of death is under investigation.\" A second release came later in the day. \"A second multi-national division center soldier died this morning of non-combat related causes. The solider died of wounds September 14 at a coalition forces combat Army support hospital,\" it read. \"The incident is under investigation.\" Inquiries Thursday from CNN were met with a news release that a press officer said had been drafted Wednesday. However, the release had not been e-mailed to reporters Wednesday, as is customary. After naming the two soldiers and giving their rank and unit, it reads, \"A U.S. soldier is in custody in connection with the shooting deaths. He is being held in custody pending review by a military magistrate. The incident continues under investigation.\" The release gives no other details. The U.S. military is classifying the death of Sgt. Dawson as \"non-hostile,\" something Dawson's father finds puzzling. \"I don't know. I really don't know,\" he said. \"I just can't get it together with that. I had never heard that before. 'Non-hostile' in a war zone?\" Lt. Col. Paul Swiergosz is a public affairs officer for the area in Iraq where the incident took place. He says the \"non-hostile\" death classification was given \"because the deaths were not the result of hostile enemy action.\" But details on what happened remain scarce. After asking, CNN received an e-mail press release from Gen. Tony Cucolo, commanding general of the Third Infantry Division that a press officer said had been drafted on Wednesday. The release, however, had not been e-mailed to reporters, as is customary.  \"We do know one soldier, a fellow noncommissioned officer, allegedly opened fire and mortally wounded his squad leader and fellow team leader,\" reads the statement. A spokesman at Fort Stewart in Georgia said, \"A soldier has been taken into custody. The incident is under investigation, and that is all I can say.\" The spokesman would not even confirm information in his commanding general's press statement. Maxine Mathis says she is stunned at how her stepson's death has been handled by the military. She says the Army assigned someone to help the family with anything they needed once they found out Darris had been killed, but she and her husband don't know how he died. She said her husband asked the liaison officer whether it was true that Darris had been killed by another U.S. solider. She said the officer denied it, insisting he didn't know anything else. Darryl Mathis continues to express his disappointment in the lack of information from the military about his son, amid rumors his son's body could be home by Saturday. \"I don't even know where he's at, at this time,\" he said. Bobby Muller, president of Veterans for America, said he thinks the way the military classifies deaths in Iraq is an attempt to keep the public combat numbers down. \"There is a clear and long-standing record, regarding the classification of causalities in Iraq to minimize combat losses. And we're seeing people wounded and killed that would have well been considered casualties from hostile action in previous conflicts. It's an attempt to conceal the actual cost of this war in terms of casualties,\" Muller said. \"The Department of Defense has announced the death of every service member who has given their life in operation Iraqi and Enduring Freedom,\" said a Pentagon spokesman, Col. Gary Keck. \"We have been open and transparent on the numbers of casualties suffered in these operations.\" Mathis says his son wanted to come home to his wife and four young children and was in the process of applying for a transfer. \"Last I spoke to him was last week Monday. He called every Monday, and said he was checking his paperwork. He said he was going to call me back once he found out. That was the last I heard from him.\" Mathis' wife cannot stop sobbing. \"We don't know why, we don't know why,\" she says \"All we know is that our son died a useless, needless death. That's all we know.\" CNN's Mike Mount and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.", "51fe083191bb5568bf6a5fea1610a8e19663d7b2": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Gov. David Paterson of New York has told state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages performed in states and countries where they are legal, his spokeswoman said Wednesday. The governor's legal counsel told state agencies in a May 14 memo to revise policies and regulations to recognize same-sex marriages performed in California and Massachusetts as well as Canada and other countries that allow gays and lesbians to marry, said Erin Duggan, the governor's spokeswoman. The memo informed state agencies that failing to recognize gay marriages would violate the New York's human rights law, Duggan said. The directive follows a February ruling from a New York state appeals court. That decision says that legal same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions are entitled to recognition in New York. \"This was in direct response to a court ruling,\" Duggan told CNN. \"Just to make sure all the state agencies are on the same page.\"  See what rules your state has about same-sex unions \u00bb . Duggan says that the court's decision was consistent with the findings of several lower courts in New York State. The governor's legal counsel sent the memo one day before the California Supreme Court struck down a ban on gay marriage in that state. Court officials in California counties may begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on June 17, state officials said Wednesday. Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriages in 2004, and gay couples need not be state residents there to wed. However, then-Gov. Mitt Romney resurrected a 1913 law barring non-resident marriages in the state if the marriage would be prohibited in the partners' home state. Subsequent court and agency decisions have determined that only residents of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Mexico may marry in Massachusetts, unless the parties say they plan to move there after the marriage.

Marita Veron, who is missing, hugs her daughter Micaela. Police believe Marita was forced into sexual slavery. Trimarco, 54, has spent the past 6\u00bd years searching for her daughter, often putting herself at risk. While chasing down leads on Marita's whereabouts, she's entered dark and dangerous brothels and confronted pimps and politicians who, she says, are complicit in her daughter's disappearance. She has won accolades throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States for her work. But Marita is nowhere to be found. \"Marita is a wonderful and caring girl. My life will be completely absorbed with this fight until she is back and safe,\" Trimarco said. On April 3, 2002, Veron left her house in the northern Argentine province of Tucuman early for a doctor's appointment. She was wearing a turquoise shirt, blue jeans and old white sneakers. As she left the house, she told her mother, \"Don't worry. I'll be back soon.\" Those were the last words the two exchanged. The investigation that has followed has led police and Trimarco to believe that she was kidnapped and forced into prostitution, either in rural Argentina or Spain. So far, a series of random clues has failed to provide any concrete information on Marita's whereabouts. Now, art is imitating life on Argentina's airwaves. Trimarco's story has become the basis of one of Argentina's most popular nighttime soap operas, \"Vidas Robadas,\" or \"Stolen Lives.\"  Watch art imitate activism \u00bb . The program premiered in March on Telefe, one of Argentina's largest television networks, to a lukewarm response. But as the storyline and characters evolved and word started to spread, the audience grew, and it became water-cooler television. \"Stolen Lives\" attracts more than 2 million viewers nightly, a considerable feat considering Argentina's population is only 40 million. The show's plot centers on widowed anthropologist Bautista Amaya (played by Facundo Arana) and Rosario Soler (Soledad Silveyra) -- the mother of a young kidnapped girl, based on Trimarco -- who team up to unravel an underground prostitution ring. \"With every performance, I try to display the inner feelings of this woman who is suffering, to transmit her grief,\" Silveyra said. \"As an actress, I feel an enormous responsibility.\" The usual telenovela themes of love, passion and revenge are ever present in \"Stolen Lives,\" but the show strives to expose an issue that has remained in the dark in Argentina until recently. Human rights groups in Argentina estimate that 800 women have gone missing at the hands of human traffickers since 2007. Worldwide, about 800,000 people are trafficked across borders annually, according to the U.S. State Department. \"I am delighted that the show has been able to bring this topic to light, because no one ever talked about human trafficking in Argentina before,\" Trimarco said. \"Stolen Lives\" is the latest in a series of recent Argentine telenovelas that dissect important social issues while also aiming to entertain. One of the most important was the 2006 hit \"Montecristo,\" which examined crimes against humanity committed by Argentina's military during the 1970s and 1980s. Local versions of \"Montecristo\" are produced in nine countries around the globe, including Turkey, Portugal, Mexico and Russia. \"With these types of telenovelas, we are able to bring something entirely new to the public debate. And because we take a take a fictional and not a journalistic approach, we are able to attract and keep more viewers,\" Telefe programming director Claudio Villarruel said. \"Montecristo\" helped reunite children of Argentina's Dirty War who \"disappeared\" with lost family members. The Dirty War happened from 1976-83, when the government carried out a secret campaign to purge the country of those it considered to be dissidents. \"Stolen Lives\" is making a similarly strong impact. Trimarco established a foundation in her daughter's honor, Fundacion Maria de los Angeles, last year in Tucuman. It counts U.S. Ambassador to Argentina Earl Wayne and Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner among its supporters. According to Trimarco, the foundation has rescued 360 women and children from trafficking networks, and leads on missing people continue to pour in. Argentina passed its first national law against human trafficking this year, a law that Trimarco lobbied hard to get passed. Meanwhile, praise rings from home and abroad. In May, \"Stolen Lives\" was declared a show of \"social interest\" by the Buenos Aires City legislature. In 2007, Trimarco received the U.S. State Department's \"International Women of Courage Award\" from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at a ceremony in Washington. Later this year, Trimarco will travel to Spain to speak about human trafficking with lawmakers from the European Union. \"It's just like Condoleezza Rice told me: My screams are being heard all over the world,\" she said. Trimarco travels around Argentina constantly, educating people about human trafficking, and following up on clues about Marita. She is also raising Marita's daughter, Micaela, 9. With all the publicity surrounding the case and the success of \"Stolen Lives,\" Trimarco has herself become a target. Her accusations of political and police involvement have led to death threats, she says. Still, she remains committed to the cause and says that collaborating with the producers of \"Stolen Lives\" to tell her story has helped give her the strength to continue searching for her daughter. \"I'm content, because my pain is now serving a purpose,\" she said.", "f2463954bc7215d8a1f98cf0d85f280fd2affa58": "(CNN) -- An earthquake shook southern Iceland on Thursday, reportedly causing injuries and damaging roads and buildings.

Its epicenter was about 50 km (31 miles) east-southeast of the capital, Reykjavik, and was about 10 km (6.2 miles) below the Earth's surface. It was unclear exactly how many people were injured or the severity of their injuries, Olli Tynes, a journalist with Reykjavik's Channel 2, told CNN. A hospital in a town near the epicenter was also reported damaged, and some wings have had to be evacuated, he said. There were no reports of fatalities, but \"great material damage,\" Tynes said. Roads and bridges in the area have been closed. The Associated Press, quoting civil defense authorities, reported 15 to 20 people from Selfoss, near the epicenter, were taken for medical treatment. Iceland's emergency management agency has swung into action, and rescue crews were headed to the area most affected by the quake. Tynes said he has been speaking to residents of the towns closest to the epicenter. \"They said they thought the world was coming to an end,\" he said. \"They thought they were going to die.\" There have been no reports of homes collapsing, as most homes in Iceland are built to withstand earthquakes, he said. Alti Mar Gylfason said he had received reports of damage to the road that rings the island nation. The quake was felt nationwide, he said. \"It was a little bit like you're sleeping in a waterbed, you know ... everything floats around,\" he said, adding that people poured out of buildings into the street. \"This is not something we experience on a normal basis.\" Although Iceland is seismically active, its last major quakes were on June 17 and June 21, 2000, with quakes of 6.5 and 6.4, respectively.

Cluster bombs are usually air-dropped shells that eject multiple small bomblets to kill enemy soldiers. A document released by Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs says the countries agreed never to use cluster munitions or the explosive bomblets they contain. The countries also agreed never to develop, acquire, retain or transfer cluster munitions. Countries attending the 11-day conference agreed to the treaty Wednesday but formally signed it Friday. The accord calls for a total, immediate ban of the weapons, strong standards to protect those injured by them, contaminated areas to be cleaned up as quickly as possible and for the weapons to be immediately destroyed, he said. Thomas Nash, coordinator of the CMC campaigning organization, said Wednesday: \"This is a great achievement for everyone who has been working hard to see the end of 40 years of suffering from these weapons.\" Though some of the biggest makers of cluster bombs, including the United States, Russia, China and Israel, were not involved in the talks and have not signed the accord, organizers predicted that those nations would nevertheless be pressured into compliance. \"Take the United States,\" Nash said. \"Almost all of its allies are here. They've decided to ban these weapons. That's going to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the United States to ever use these weapons again, either on its own or in joint operations.\" The agreement requires the destruction of stockpiles of the weapons within eight years, he said. Cluster munitions, which break apart in flight to scatter hundreds of smaller bomblets, are what the International Committee of the Red Cross calls a \"persistent humanitarian problem.\" Most of a cluster bomb's bomblets are meant to explode on impact, but many do not. Estimates show the weapons fail to explode on impact between 10 and 40 percent of the time, the Red Cross says. That means unexploded bomblets lie scattered across a target area, often exploding only when handled or disturbed -- posing a serious risk to civilians. Last week, Acting Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs Stephen D. Mull called it \"an absolute moral obligation\" to rid a battlefield of unexploded ordnance after the battle. But he also predicted that the United States would not agree to any ban. \"We think that it is going to be impossible to ban cluster munitions... because these are weapons that have a certain military utility and are of use,\" Mull said. \"The United States relies on them as an important part of our own defense strategy.\" Instead, he urged that the weapons be regulated \"to take humanitarian considerations into account\" and that \"technological fixes\" be pursued that would render them harmless after a battle. During the 34-day war in Lebanon in 2006, the United Nations estimated that Israel dropped 4 million bomblets, 1 million of which may not have exploded, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. More than 250 civilians and bomb-disposal operators have been killed or injured by them in southern Lebanon since the war ended. Cluster bombs were also used in the 1999 war in Kosovo. Lt. Col. Jim Burke, a military adviser to the Irish Defense Forces said they quickly became a major killer of civilians. In more than 20 countries, according to the ICRC, cluster bombs have created lasting \"no-go\" areas, rendering them as dangerous as minefields. Laos is the most affected country. Millions of bomblets dropped during the Vietnam War continue to kill civilians more than three decades later. Still, militaries consider cluster bombs important for use against multiple targets dispersed over a wide area, such as tanks or military personnel moving across the landscape. A single bomb containing hundreds of submunitions can cover more than 18 square miles.

Indonesia has become a net importer of oil due to declining production levels. Purnomo Yusgiantoro said the move follows declining oil production levels in Indonesia that have left the country a net importer of oil. \"In the future, if our production (comes) back again to the level that gives us a status as a net oil exporter, then I think we can go back to OPEC again,\" he said. \"But today we decided that we are pulling out of OPEC.\" It was not immediately clear what effect Indonesia's decision will have on global oil prices. However the move was not unexpected. Indonesia, which joined OPEC in 1962, is the only southeast Asian country in the 13-nation oil cartel. Oil production there has steadily decreased in the last decade because of disappointing exploration efforts and declining production, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Since 1996, total production has dropped by 32 percent. The country's current output quota for crude oil as set by OPEC is 1.45 million barrels a day -- well above its production capacity. In 2006, Indonesia imported more oil than it exported.

Rear Adm. John Stufflebeem was demoted and fired from his post as director of the Navy staff. In March, when the report was submitted to Pentagon officials, Rear Adm. John Stufflebeem was demoted and fired from his post as director of the Navy staff. Stufflebeem told investigators he couldn't remember the name of the woman he had an affair with. He also lied when he told investigators he did not engage in sexual relations with the woman, identified as \"Jane Doe,\" the Defense Department's inspector general's report said. Jane Doe, who was then unmarried and working for a federal agency, told the investigators the allegations were true, the report said. Her supervisor and Stufflebeem's superiors supported her testimony. Stufflebeem was convicted April 18 of making false official statements to investigators. After the hearing, called an admiral's mast, he requested retirement. Jane Doe told investigators that she and Stufflebeem began their affair on an overseas trip in 1989, that the married admiral told her he was a widower who was raising his children as a single parent and that they had sexual relations several times, including once in a White House room reserved for \"military aides with overnight duties.\" She also told investigators that Stufflebeem came to her home on the day in August 1990 when she learned he was married and that she called him \"scum,\" shut the door in his face and never spoke to him again. Read the report (PDF) \"We found Ms. Doe to be an extremely credible, candid and articulate witness who willingly participated in our interview with the knowledge and support of her husband,\" the report said. By contrast, the report said, Stufflebeem's testimony was \"inconsistent with the weight of the evidence,\" and \"it did not appear Stufflebeem's misstatements in these areas of testimony were inadvertent.\" At issue was Stufflebeem's removal from his post as a presidential aide in 1990. Stufflebeem testified that he initiated the request to leave his White House post because of \"close family personal problems.\" But his superiors testified that he was removed from the post because of his relationship with the woman -- and that he admitted the affair. Jane Doe's supervisor told investigators that when she learned of the affair from Doe, she confirmed Stufflebeem's marital status and told Doe what she'd learned. \"Ms. Doe's reaction, according to the supervisor, was one of complete surprise and shock,\" the report said. The supervisor also said that she telephoned Stufflebeem's immediate supervisor to tell him of the affair and that when she called a few weeks later to follow up, the supervisor told her that \"everybody in town knew Boomer was f'ing some bimbo at the [federal agency].\" Stufflebeem, however, denied to investigators that he had a sexual relationship with Jane Doe, although he admitted to one kiss and said he had an \"inappropriate relationship\" with her because he told her about his marital problems. \"I did not have sex with this woman,\" he said during one of two interviews with investigators. Although he told investigators he could not remember the woman's name, he testified that he \"had to live with shame for a long time\" after the \"inappropriate relationship\" ended, that he was \"racked with guilt\" and \"had a terrible time getting myself right with my family.\" \"So I have had a great 18-year career since I left the White House,\" he said, according to the report. \"If this is the end of it, then I still leave a rewarded individual, thankful for the blessings that I have had.\" Investigators found Stufflebeem's remarks inconsistent. \"In our view, comments regarding guilt, shame, and the end of a distinguished naval career are incongruous with a physical relationship limited to one kiss,\" they wrote in the report. This year, according to the report, the inspector general's office provided Stufflebeem with its preliminary findings: that he'd provided \"false and misleading testimony\" regarding the nature of his relationship with Jane Doe, his inability to recall her name and his representation to her of himself as a widower. Stufflebeem responded with a vehement denial. \"[I] find it extremely regrettable, in a case that has such far reaching implications for my career, that you have chosen to question my integrity,\" he wrote in a February 15 letter. \"The unfortunate truth in this case is that, as a result of lack of evidence to substantiate the allegation of a sexual relationship and in lieu of investigating the underlying allegations, you have chosen to accuse me of being untruthful as I defended myself against these allegations.\" Stufflebeem further castigated the investigators because, at that time, they had chosen not to interview Jane Doe \"in deference to Ms. Doe's privacy,\" according to the report. Doe \"readily agreed\" to testify when they contacted her after Stufflebeem's rebuttal. \"Ms. Doe confirmed that she and Stufflebeem had an extensive physical relationship which began on an overseas trip and lasted intermittently for approximately eight months,\" the investigators wrote. \"The relationship included sexual intercourse on approximately one dozen occasions, to include intercourse during overseas travel, in the White House and in her home.\" Doe also said Stufflebeem told her that his wife had died of breast cancer, that a woman who answered the phone when she called his home was the children's nanny and that he continued to wear his wedding ring \"for his daughters who missed their late mother.\" According to the report, the investigation began when investigators received an anonymous letter containing \"significant\" details about the affair. Investigators had received another such letter in 1999, but it contained no detail and was not investigated. Stufflebeem became well known in the initial months of the war in Afghanistan, when he often conducted on-camera television briefings as a Pentagon spokesman. He was then deputy director for global operations on the Joint Staff. He was commander of the 6th Fleet from May 2005 to September 2007. During that time, he was deputy commander of Naval Forces Europe, joint force maritime component commander in Europe, commander of strike and support forces for NATO, and allied commander with Joint Command Lisbon.

Customs supervisor Walter Golembiowski and officer John Ajello face narcotics, bribery and conspiracy charges in the case, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Golembiowski and Ajello regularly solicited and accepted bribes to allow contraband to pass through undetected, the DEA said. Two airport workers and two others were also charged with importing counterfeit goods. Some of those items included Rolex, Cartier and Chanel watches and designer sunglasses, the DEA said. On several occasions, Golembiowski was captured on audio and video taking bribes to aid his co-conspirators in bringing in illegal drugs and counterfeit goods. \"Smuggling any kind of illegal commodity raises troubling issues at a time of deep concern over national security,\" said Michael J. Garcia, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. \"The threat is heightened when a government official accepts bribes to help smugglers breach our borders.\" The arrests came as a result of a lengthy sting operation by a state, local and federal task force. Prosecutors said numerous recorded meetings and phone calls captured the suspects talking about plans to smuggle hashish, ecstasy and other illegal items. The investigation has led to the indictment and prosecution of more than 20 people -- \"from distributors to overseas sources of supply\" -- and the seizure of more than 600 pounds of imported hashish and other drugs from the United States and France, according to the statement.", "7551503e7e57bd519913b0df90ca1e80d5305b05": "(CNN) -- The crib in Ellen Darcy's Boston home has sat empty for more than a year. And in suburban Washington, Laura Teresinski has prepared a nursery for a baby that may never arrive. Guatemala has announced it will conduct a case-by-case review of every pending foreign adoption case. They and thousands of prospective parents, eager to adopt children from abroad, have found themselves in an emotional legal limbo since two of the most popular countries for international adoptions -- Guatemala and Vietnam -- recently halted their programs. Now would-be mothers and fathers around the United States wonder what will become of their quest to adopt a child -- a pursuit that can fray nerves, cost up to $30,000 and span several years. Guatemala announced this month that it would conduct a case-by-case review of every pending foreign adoption case. That put on hold the adoption plans of about 2,000 American families. The crackdown comes amid reports that some in Guatemala coerce mothers to relinquish their children for adoption -- or steal the children outright and present them as orphans. Similar accusations have arisen in Vietnam. After the United States accused adoption agencies there of corruption and baby-selling, Vietnam said in April that it would no longer allow adoptions to the United States. \"My husband and I were absolutely devastated,\" Teresinski said. \"Adoptive parents have put a lot of emotional energy and a lot of financial resources in the process.\" Vietnam's decision affects several hundred families. Families in the United States adopted 4,728 children from Guatemala and 828 from Vietnam last year. The halt in adoptions from those two nations unfolds against the backdrop of a dramatic rise in international adoptions in the United States. The number of foreign-born children adopted by U.S. families more than tripled from 1990 to 2004, when it reached a high of 22,884, though the figure has declined slightly each year since. In 2007, the U.S. granted visas to 19,613 children so they could join an adoptive family in the United States, according to U.S. State Department figures. About 70 percent of those children came from four countries: China, Guatemala, Russia and Ethiopia. A few other countries have also halted foreign adoptions at various times, including Kazakhstan and Togo. Yet the suspensions in Vietnam and Guatemala have had the biggest impact -- they're two of the 10 countries that send the most children to adoptive homes in the Unites States. Fear of fraud stirs heartache . For Darcy, the review seems more detrimental than helpful. Her adopted daughter, Carolina, remains in a Guatemalan foster home with three dozen other babies. Darcy worries that keeping Carolina, now 15 months old, in a foster home will harm her early development. \"She's not getting one-on-one care by a consistent caretaker,\" Darcy said, adding later, \"Nobody is looking at this as a violation of the kids' human rights except for these (American) parents.\" Guatemala, which until now has had little to no oversight of its foreign adoptions, has the highest per capita rate of adoption in the world. Nearly one in 100 babies born in Guatemala wind up living with adoptive parents in the United States, according to the U.S. consulate in Guatemala. While adoptive parents in the United States undergo rigorous screening, adoptions in Guatemala had been processed by notaries responsible for determining whether the babies were relinquished voluntarily. They also arrange foster care and handle paperwork -- notaries in Latin America tend to have more legal training than notaries in the United States. Both Guatemalan and U.S. officials fear the system leads to practices such as paying birth mothers for children or, in some instances, coercion. Officials in both countries say gaps in regulations and the high sums of money at play -- adoptions can cost up to $30,000 -- may have created unintended incentives in a country where the State Department estimates that 80 percent of the population lives in poverty. The Guatemalan government has said its review could take a month or longer. As for the American families, they can only wait. \"I think it's overkill,\" said Darcy, who was matched with Carolina last March and was approved to adopt the girl last winter -- typically one of the last steps before the actual adoption is complete. \"No adoptive parent wants to adopt an abducted child -- a child that wasn't voluntarily relinquished -- but to keep them as hostages is unacceptable,\" Darcy said. Guatemala plans reforms . U.S. officials say they sympathize with the parents, but that reviews like the one in Guatemala are in the best interest of the children. \"We feel for them, it's a tough situation,\" said a State Department official who is not authorized to speak on the record. \"(But) they'll have the comfort of knowing American parents in the future who adopt from Guatemala will get children from a system that has all the safeguards in place so that children are not exploited,\" the official said. In the past, Guatemala required birth mothers to sign a document in court saying they were relinquishing their child. They were not required to reveal their reasons. Now the government may require the presence of the birth mother and child. The goal is to verify identification and make sure the mother is giving up her child voluntarily. Cleaning up Guatemala's adoption system is a step toward complying with the standards of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, an international agreement that governs adoptions from one country to another. About 70 nations have signed the convention, which seeks to ensure legitimate foreign adoptions. The United States joined the international convention last year, and rules governing adoptions from one signatory nation to another took effect April 1. The United States has stopped issuing visas to Guatemalan children after that date, blocking their travel to America -- at least until concerns are addressed. \"We're not pointing fingers at American parents,\" the State Department official said. However, the review and changes in Guatemala will ensure that it \"does not become a fertile ground for (wrongful) practices on any person, particularly children, who have not been orphaned.\" To offset corruption, the U.S. Embassy has added its own requirement: That birth mothers appear with the baby to request a visa for the baby. In August, officials also began requiring two DNA tests to confirm the identities of mother and child. Still, the Guatemalan solicitor general's office has identified at least 80 cases of adoption irregularities, including baby stealing and false DNA tests. And the Guatemalan chief prosecutor's office recently launched a criminal investigation into the two laboratories contracted to take DNA samples from birth mothers and children. 'Serious irregularities' in Vietnam . Similar concerns of corruption recently emerged in Vietnam, where investigators had found \"serious adoption irregularities,\" according to a report by the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi. Documents had been forged or altered, the embassy said, and some parents were paid, tricked or forced into giving up their children for adoption. In some cases, the embassy said, children were offered for adoption without the knowledge or permission of their parents. The Vietnamese government has denied the accusations. Even so, it said in April that it would terminate its adoption agreement with the United States, saying it won't accept applications after July 1. The program is scheduled to end September 1. Parents in the United States who were matched with an adoptive child in Vietnam before July 1 will be allowed to adopt that child. Prospective parents who had invested time and money, but had not been matched with an adoptive child, appear to be out of luck. Private adoption agencies insist that nearly all adoptions from Vietnam are problem-free, and they want the adoptions to continue. \"It's hard to let go, because we know we can advocate for these children and make a real difference,\" said Linda Brownlee, executive director of the nonprofit Adoption Center of Washington, which places children for adoption from Russia, China, Cambodia and Vietnam. She hopes the United States and Vietnam reach an agreement so that adoptions can continue. \"Without it, I think children are going to be harmed. They are going to die needlessly, and there is going to be trafficking,\" Brownlee said.", "c34a0cbf6db61323766fc86b1b89b399ff6b0666": "(CNN) -- Authorities have re-arrested three men in connection with the disappearance of an Alabama teenager in Aruba in 2005, based on new evidence in the case, prosecutors announced Wednesday.

Van der Sloot is attending school in Holland. The three had previously been arrested in 2005, Aruban prosecutors noted in a statement, but a court released them, citing insufficient evidence.

Van der Sloot, now 20, and the Kalpoes, now ages 24 and 21, were the last people seen with Holloway, 18, as she left Carlos n' Charlie's nightclub in Oranjestad, Aruba, about 1:30 a.m. on May 30, 2005. All three men have maintained their innocence in her disappearance.  View a timeline of the case \u00bb . No information was immediately available about what the new evidence was that led to the arrests. Aruban prosecutors said a team of detectives from the Netherlands has been reviewing the Holloway case at the request of authorities in Aruba, and had been on the island as late as last month to complete the investigation. The Kalpoe brothers were being interrogated by Aruban police Wednesday, Aruba prosecutor Dop Kruimel told CNN. They will appear before a judge Friday for a preliminary arrest hearing, in which the judge determines whether the arrest was credible, she said. The judge can then authorize their being detained for eight more days, meaning police have that much time to produce evidence. The suspects then go before a judge again, she said. Van der Sloot was arrested in Arnhem, the Netherlands, by Dutch police, Kruimel said. Aruban authorities have asked for him to be extradited to Aruba within eight days. Because they were not familiar with the case, Dutch police were not questioning Van der Sloot, she said. He will be questioned when he is brought back to Aruba, she said. However, he will appear before a judge Thursday in Arnhem. When CNN called the Kalpoe household, the person who answered the phone hung up. Earlier, Van der Sloot's mother, Anita Van der Sloot, told CNN her son had not been arrested, but had only reported to a police station in the Netherlands for questioning Wednesday after receiving a letter asking him to do so. Anita Van der Sloot said she had spoken to her son briefly from her home in Aruba. She said a Dutch attorney was with him, and she expected him to appear before a judge and be released Thursday. Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway, said in a statement, \"The family is always hopeful when a step in the right direction is made in the case.\" Beth Holloway was refusing interviews for now, said spokeswoman Sunny Tillman. She previously was known as Beth Holloway-Twitty, but has returned to using Holloway after a divorce earlier this year. Natalee Holloway was visiting Aruba with a group of about 100 classmates celebrating their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama, when she went to Carlos n' Charlie's that night in 2005. The group had planned to leave for home the following day, and Holloway's packed bags and passport were found in her hotel room after she failed to show up for her flight. Her disappearance triggered an exhaustive search and investigation and a media sensation in the United States, Aruba, the Netherlands and beyond, but Holloway has never been found. Aruban authorities have been criticized for their handling of the case. At least 10 men, including Van der Sloot and the Kalpoes, have been arrested and identified as suspects either in Holloway's disappearance or in an alleged cover-up. All were questioned and released. Legal experts, however, have said differences in the U.S. and Aruban systems should be taken into account. Aruba's criminal justice system is based on Dutch law and a descendant of the Napoleonic code. In Aruba, authorities' reasonable suspicion that someone knows about or is involved in a crime is enough to make an arrest, while magistrates investigate and judges determine a suspect's guilt or innocence. There are no jury trials. Aruban authorities, meanwhile, have suggested that Holloway may have overdosed on drugs or died of alcohol poisoning. Beth Holloway and Natalee Holloway's father, Dave Holloway, filed a lawsuit last year against Van der Sloot and his father, Aruban judge Paulus Van der Sloot, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The Van der Sloots were served with the suit while on a trip to New York. However, a judge in August 2006 dismissed the suit, saying New York was an inconvenient forum in which to consider it. It was unclear whether Holloway's parents have pursued legal action elsewhere. E-mail to a friend .

It was the first violence in the coastal city since a wave of xenophobia began about two weeks ago in Johannesburg, resulting in at least 42 deaths. The foreign nationals were transported from the city after angry crowds formed at a public meeting seeking to calm tensions, Jones told CNN. They were being housed at community centers and churches.

And more than 400 have been arrested for crimes ranging from murder, to causing a public disturbance, he said. The country has also seen a disturbing throwback to the 1980s apartheid-era lynching tactic of \"necklacing,\" which was widely used in the townships at the time. Used on suspected informants, the \"necklace\" is a car tire, filled with petrol, put around the person's neck and set alight. The victims are mainly immigrants and refugees from other parts of Africa, including Zimbabwe, where a devastated economy has sent at least two million people across the border in search of a better life. Some say the attacks stem from a long-standing feeling among locals that the number of immigrants in South Africa results in shortages of jobs and essential needs. Inadequate housing, a lack of running water and electricity, the rising prices of food, and escalating crime -- nearly 20,000 people were slain in South Africa last year -- add to the resentment.  Watch analysis of reasons behind xenophobic attacks \u00bb . According to South Africa's latest census, the country has about 45 million people. The South African Department of Human Affairs estimates that more than 4 million people reside in South Africa illegally, but that figure is based on a 10-year-old study and some feel the number of immigrants in South Africa is much higher. Some say that millions have recently fled to South Africa from Zimbabwe because of violence there since the county's stalled election.

George Ryan and a co-defendant lost another legal round at the Supreme Court on Tuesday and will remain in prison on federal racketeering and fraud convictions. Ex-Gov. George Ryan walks out of a Chicago, Illinois, courthouse after his April 2006 conviction. Ryan and businessman Larry Warner claimed they did not receive a fair trial, but the justices, without comment, refused to intervene in the case. Justice John Paul Stevens refused last fall to grant bail for the 74-year-old Ryan, a move that would have kept him out of jail to file more appeals. The disgraced ex-governor reported to a federal prison in Wisconsin in November to serve a 6\u00bd-year sentence. The men were convicted in April 2006 for fraud in a case stemming from bribes paid for various state licenses. Their lawyers claimed the trial judge improperly removed two jurors while deliberations in the case had commenced, but a federal appeals court upheld the convictions. Ryan, a Republican, served as governor from 1999 to 2003. He retired following investigations into political corruption in his administration. He also was noted for issuing a moratorium on capital punishment in his state in 2000 over concerns innocent inmates might be executed. The case decided Tuesday is Warner and Ryan v.

A fire burns following an attack on a pipeline in Nigeria in December 2006. The Nigerian military confirmed an attack on an oil pipeline and an explosion, but called the claim that 11 soldiers were killed a \"lie\" and \"pure propaganda.\" The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND, issued a statement saying it \"successfully sabotaged another major trunk pipeline\" belonging to the Shell Petroleum Development Company in the country's Rivers State. \"Minutes after the sabotage, our fighters encountered a military gunboat which opened fire blindly on the advance guard. We flanked them in a counter-attack and killed in close combat all the drunken soldiers numbering eleven, collecting their weapons, ammunitions and bullet-proof vests before using dynamite to sink the gunboat with its dead occupants,\" MEND said. MEND also said they found two \"traumatized, adolescent girls\" who were gang-raped by Nigerian soldiers. \"They were dropped off in the neighboring village by our men who have since returned safely to camp,\" the statement said. The military had no immediate response to that claim. Analysts say that one reason for record high gas prices in the United States is a spate of attacks on oil pipelines in Nigeria, the fourth largest supplier of oil to the United States. Exxon and Shell are two of several companies that had been extracting two million barrels of oil a day in Nigeria. Yet rebel attacks on oil pipelines in the Niger Delta have cut overall production by roughly 10 percent -- meaning 200,000 fewer barrels of oil on some days. The rebel group hopes to secure a greater share of oil wealth for people in the Niger Delta, where more than 70 percent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day. MEND has bombed pipelines and kidnapped hundreds of foreign oil workers, typically releasing them unharmed, sometimes after receiving a ransom payment. The Nigerian government has proposed a peace summit to find a solution to the region's problems, but an immediate resolution does not appear in sight.", "c9414bf55859cb9ca7e925a4a09b416b6f66446a": "(REAL SIMPLE) -- With soaring gas prices and travel costs, the cheapest route to whisk yourself away this summer is through a good book.

Barack Obama received key endorsements Friday from a top former Clinton administration official and two former Democratic senators. Robert Reich, a former Labor Secretary under President Clinton, endorsed Sen. Obama Friday. Robert Reich, a former Clinton cabinet member and longtime friend of the former president, formally endorsed Obama's White House bid, saying that \"my conscience won't let me be silent any longer.\" \"Although Hillary Clinton has offered solid and sensible policy proposals, Obama's strike me as even more so,\" Reich wrote on his blog. He served as the Secretary of Labor from 1993-1997 and is currently a professor at Brandeis University. \"His plans for reforming Social Security and health care have a better chance of succeeding,\" Reich continued. \"His approaches to the housing crisis and the failures of our financial markets are sounder than hers ... He has put forward the more enlightened foreign policy and the more thoughtful plan for controlling global warming.\" Reich, whose relationship with the Clintons dates back to their law school days at Yale, has long been a critic of the New York senator's White House bid. Shortly before the Iowa caucuses in January, he wrote that voters would have a choice \"between someone who talks the talk, and somebody who's walked the walk.\" \"I don't get it,\" he wrote then. \"If there's anyone in the race whose history shows unique courage and character, it's Barack Obama. HRC's [Hillary Rodham Clinton's] campaign, by contrast, is singularly lacking in conviction about anything.\" Reich also criticized Bill Clinton earlier in the year over the former president's sharp attacks on Obama in South Carolina. \"Bill Clinton's ill-tempered and ill-founded attacks on Barack Obama are doing no credit to the former president, his legacy, or his wife's campaign,\" he wrote in January. \"Nor are they helping the Democratic Party.\" Asked to respond to Reich's endorsement, Clinton spokesman Mo Eleithee said, \"Didn't he endorse him last year?\" Reich is the latest former Clinton administration official to announce his support for Obama. Last month, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who held several positions under Bill Clinton, also came out in support of the Illinois senator. Clinton supporter and CNN political analyst James Carville later called that an \"act of betrayal.\" Meanwhile, the Obama campaign announced that former Sens. Sam Nunn of Georgia and David Boren of Oklahoma endorsed the Illinois senator, and agreed to serve on the campaign's national security policy team. Nunn served 25 years in the Senate and was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee from 1987 to 1995. He said Obama is \"our best choice to lead the nation.\" \"I believe that he will bring to the White House, high principles, clear vision and sound judgment,\" he added. Boren -- who served in the Senate from 1979 to 1994 and is the longest-serving Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence -- was one of Bill Clinton's top choices to replace Les Aspes in 1994 as U.S. Secretary of Defense. He said Obama is a person of \"sound and good judgement.\" Obama responded to the endorsements in a statement, saying the two \"will be important sources of advice and counsel for our campaign in the months ahead.\"  Watch more from the campaign trail \u00bb . The endorsements come just four days before Pennsylvania's April 22 primary. At stake: 158 delegates. Also on Friday, Clinton accused Obama of \"complaining\" about Wednesday night's debate in Pennsylvania and hinted her rival might not be equipped to handle the rigors of the Oval Office.   Watch more from Wednesday's debate \u00bb . Obama said Thursday that Clinton was \"in her element\" at the debate, telling a North Carolina crowd she \"took every opportunity to get a dig in.\" \"That's her right to kind of twist the knife in a little bit,\" he said, before adding that he understands why she's using what he calls the tactics of the GOP.  Watch more of Obama's comments \u00bb . Clinton told an interviewer Friday morning on WTXF in Philadelphia that \"being asked tough questions in a debate is nothing like the pressures you face inside the White House.\" \"When the going gets tough you can't run away,\" she said of Obama. Meanwhile, Obama faced more criticism Friday -- this time from Sen. John McCain. McCain's campaign is crying foul over what it characterizes as repeated distortions from Obama. The most recent dustup comes after Obama criticized McCain earlier Friday for comments the Arizona senator made in an interview on Bloomberg Television. \"John McCain went on television and said that there has been quote 'great progress economically over the last seven and a half years,' \" Obama told a Pennsylvania crowd. \"John McCain thinks our economy has made great progress under George W. Bush. Now, how could somebody who has been traveling across this country, somebody who came to Erie, Pennsylvania, say we've made great progress?\" The McCain campaign immediately took issue with the comment, noting the Arizona senator also said he knows families are facing \"tremendous economic challenges.\" \"American families are hurting and Barack Obama is being recklessly dishonest,\" McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said. The McCain campaign has long argued Obama has a habit of twisting McCain's words.  E-mail to a friend .

President Bush has twice vetoed bills that would have eased limits on funding for embryonic stem cell research. People who believe that life begins at conception liken the destruction of the embryonic stem cells to killing and therefore oppose their use in research. The new research, they said, shows that alternatives are available. \"By avoiding techniques that destroy life, while vigorously supporting alternative approaches, President Bush is encouraging scientific advancement within ethical boundaries,\" the White House said Tuesday in a written statement on the new research. Bush has twice vetoed bills that would have eased restrictions on the use of federal funds for research involving embryonic stem cells. Watch Bush state why he opposes the use of stem cells . In August 2001, he limited federal funding for embryonic stem cell research to lines that had already been created. But some researchers say those cells are not useful. \"The president believes medical problems can be solved without compromising either the high aims of science or the sanctity of human life,\" the White House statement said. \"We will continue to encourage scientists to expand the frontiers of stem cell research and continue to advance the understanding of human biology in an ethically responsible way.\" Watch a Harvard expert talk about what's next in stem cell research \u00bb . \"This breakthrough provides further evidence that the most promising avenues of stem cell research are also the most ethical,\" concurred Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, a physician. \"Politicians should note that the scientific community is moving rapidly without the assistance of laws requiring the taxpayer-funded destruction of human life.\" He added, \"This breakthrough helps vindicate President Bush's policy and his vetoes of Congress' short-sighted and outdated approach to stem cell research. History will note the wisdom of President Bush's refusal to set a dangerous precedent that could not be easily undone.\" And Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said he believes \"that the current stem cell policy has been very important in driving the discovery of ethical and successful ways for scientists to find treatments and cures. \"What has too often been missing from this important debate is a simple fact of modern science: Encouraging medical research and protecting the sanctity of life are not mutually exclusive goals.\" The methods described in the papers about the new research \"should continue to be pursued and strongly promoted, as they should help to steer the entire field of stem cell research in a more explicitly ethical direction by circumventing the moral quagmire associated with destroying human embryos,\" said the National Catholic Bioethics Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in a posting on its Web site. But those views were not shared by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who has pushed for federal funding of embryonic stem cell research and said he will continue to do so. \"Our top researchers recognize that this new development does not mean that we should discontinue studying embryonic stem cells,\" he said in a written statement. \"Scientists may yet find that embryonic stem cells are more powerful. We need to continue to pursue all alternatives as we search for treatments for diabetes, Parkinson's and spinal cord injuries.\" He added that Tuesday's announcement \"reiterates the need for federal support for medical research and again points out the president's misplaced priorities in vetoing the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill which included a substantial increase for the National Institutes of Health.\" A lead author of one of the landmark studies, James Thomson of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, urged that reprogrammed cells not wholly supplant embryonic stem cells in research. \"I don't like the idea of pulling the plug,\" he told reporters in a conference call. He added that Tuesday's advances in reprogramming cells would not have been possible without the advancements in embryonic stem cell research over the past decade.

Josef Fritzl appeared in court after admitting raping his daughter and fathering her seven children. Germany's Bild newspaper quoted a holiday companion, identified only as Paul H, who said he and 73-year-old Fritzl traveled to Thailand together twice and spent time in each other's homes. \"He went [to Thailand] without his wife; apparently she had to look after the children. ... Once he had a very long massage from a young Thai girl at the beach. He really loved that,\" Paul H told the newspaper, which featured video of Fritzl laughing and receiving a massage in Thailand on its Web site. \"Once I saw how Josef bought an evening dress and racy lingerie for a very slim woman in Pattaya [Thailand] on the beach.

They were never allowed downstairs into the cellar, but we never thought anything of it,\" he told Bild. \"Now that I think of the dungeon down there, I feel really sick in the stomach.\" Paul H said Fritzl was a DIY \"genius,\" constantly extending and building on to the house. Meanwhile, family members at the center of the incest and imprisonment case have held an \"astonishing\" reunion, medical officials said. \"They met each other on Sunday morning,\" clinic director Berthold Kepplinger said Tuesday. \"And it is astonishing how easy it worked, that the children came together, and also it was astonishing how easy it happened that the grandmother and the mother came together.\" Investigators say Fritzl held his daughter, Elisabeth, captive in a cellar for 24 years. He raped her repeatedly, they say, and eventually fathered seven of her children. Elisabeth and two of her children were reunited Sunday with three of her other children and her mother, Kepplinger said Tuesday. The three children and her mother lived in the home above the cellar. Elisabeth's eldest child, 19-year-old Kerstin Fritzl, remains in hospital. A seventh child died years ago, shortly after birth. Fritzl told police he burned the infant's body in a furnace. The story of the family's imprisonment began to unravel a week ago, when Kerstin fell seriously ill with convulsions and was hospitalized. Austrian police Wednesday denied reports that they were investigating possible links between Fritzl and the unsolved murder of a woman. Franz Polzer, director of the Lower Austrian Bureau of Criminal Affairs, said Fritzl had owned an Austrian hotel near where a woman was found murdered decades ago. However, they were not investigating the incident at this stage. Meanwhile, an Austrian girl who was held prisoner in a basement for eight years said the family faced a long period of adjustment.

Pulling them abruptly out of this situation, without transition, to hold them and isolating them to some extent, it can't be good for them.\" Officials said Tuesday that DNA testing had confirmed Fritzl fathered the children.

Authorities said Fritzl sent other letters over the years, leading the family to believe that Elisabeth was a runaway who had abandoned three of her children on their doorstep. He dictated at least one of the letters to his daughter, they said. Authorities said it did not appear that Fritzl's wife, Rosemarie, knew about her husband's activities. Reports have surfaced in The Times of London and Austria's Presse that Fritzl was convicted of sexual assault in the 1960s, but there is nothing in his record to confirm this, said District Governor Hans Heinz Lenze. He added, however, that records were expunged after a certain number of years. Prosecutors were checking archives to find the information, said Gerhard Sedlacek, prosecutor for the state of Poelten.

Supporters carry posters of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. Hassan Nasrallah said: \"We don't want to have control over Lebanon, or to have governance over Lebanon or to impose our ideas over the people of Lebanon, because we believe Lebanon to be a special and diverse country that needs the collaboration of everyone.\" Nasrallah spoke a day after Lebanon's parliament elected Michel Sleiman the country's president after a six-month vacancy in the position. Nasrallah, speaking at a packed stadium, told his followers: \"I renew my appeal and invitation for a true national partnership with no eliminations or impositions. The national unity government is not the victory of the opposition against the pro-government. It is the victory of all Lebanese.\" He said Sleiman's election \"renews the hope amongst the Lebanese people to a new era and a new start.\" \"I must say that there are deep wounds from our side and theirs, we are both in front of two choices; either to expand the wounds and add salt to them or try to cure them for the sake of Lebanon and we prefer the second choice.\" The parliament had tried 19 times to vote on a new president, but failed because of disagreements over how to share power in a new Cabinet. Lebanon's Western-backed government and the Hezbollah-led opposition reached a deal last week aimed at ending an 18-month political crisis that pushed the country to the brink of civil war, and paved the way for Sleiman's election. The agreement, reached in Doha, Qatar, calls for a consensus government in which the Cabinet would be comprised of 30 posts -- 16 for the majority, 11 for the Hezbollah-led opposition and three set aside for the president to nominate. The seat allocation had been a key sticking point for the opposition, which wanted to ensure it had the power to veto major decisions. With 11 Cabinet posts, it will have that power. In exchange for the veto power and a redistricting plan ahead of next year's elections, Hezbollah agreed to end its sit-in protest that has paralyzed downtown Beirut since late 2006. In his speech, Sleiman expressed gratitude to Qatar and to the Arab League for helping broker the deal. Sleiman was the consensus candidate, and is viewed as a neutral party by Lebanon's political factions. The nation's previous presidents have been seen as either pro-Syrian or pro-Western. In his 10 years as chief of the army, Sleiman also is believed to have unified the splintered military. However, he inherits a nation grappling with divisions. Lebanon's elected, pro-Western government has long been locked in a power struggle with Hezbollah. In public statements and demonstrations in recent years, Hezbollah threatened to use its power and popularity to oust the Sunni-led government, triggering fears of a new civil war that could further destabilize the volatile region. The election helped end a political crisis that deteriorated into violence this month. That crisis was defused when the Lebanese government gave in to two key Hezbollah demands -- lifting a government ban of Hezbollah's telecommunications system and reinstating the chief of security at Beirut's airport. \"The performance of the opposition proved that it did not organize a coup, but only wanted the illegal government to withdraw its two decisions,\" Nasrallah said. \"I promise that the opposition's representation in the government will not be monopolized by Hezbollah, Amal and the Change and Reform bloc. We will give other opposition parties shares - and unfortunately we must speak of shares - even if it is at the expense of Hezbollah's shares.\" Hezbollah has been linked to numerous terrorist attacks against U.S., Israeli, and other Western targets and the United States lists it as a terrorist organization. But many in Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East -- particularly Shiites -- view Hezbollah militants as freedom fighters.", "8a5035d3527c4db4357dd1db9fb2712008dccea9": "(CNN) -- Children from a polygamist sect who one mother says are \"hurting very badly\" in state custody are likely to be returned to their parents, a CNN legal analyst says.

Consumer Reports magazine recently reached a similar conclusion when it announced the results of a study that compared the cost of ownership of more than 300 cars. Consumer Reports noted that a car with a cheaper sticker price can often cost consumers more in the long run when compared to a higher-priced alternative. The report, which appeared in Consumer Reports' Annual April Auto Issue, was based on a comparison of the 300 models in the Consumer Reports database. In short, the report concluded that a car's sticker price is one of many factors that should be taken into account when trying to decide between two cars in the same class. For example, at about $17,500, a Mitsubishi Lancer is priced $5,000 less than a Mini Cooper. But when factoring in the total costs of ownership for each vehicle, the Lancer could cost drivers about $3,000 more to own over the first five years, according to the study. And the purchase price of a Toyota Highlander is about $3,000 more than a V6 Ford Explorer -- but the Explorer's total cost of ownership is an extra $6,500 over those five years. The study took into account such factors as depreciation, fuel costs, interest paid on the car loan, insurance, maintenance, repair costs and sales tax. Online subscribers to www.ConsumerReports.org can compare the costs for one, three, five and eight years of ownership. \"We think this information is valuable for consumers who have shopped around, and settled on a couple of different cars they like, and then have to decide on one or the other,\" noted Cliff Weathers, Consumer Reports' deputy editor, autos. \"We're giving this information to the consumer to use as a tool to help them make that decision, a tie-breaker, if you will. \"If they're trying to decide between a Pontiac Solstice and Mazda Miata, for example, they can go to our Web site and find out which one will cost less to own over that five-year period. And in this particular case, the answer would be the Miata -- which was one of the least expensive cars to own of all the cars evaluated in our survey.\" Depreciation was factored into the estimates based on the assumption that the vehicle will eventually be traded in when buyers make their next car purchase. \"Depreciation is the factor that accounts for the highest cost of ownership,\" Weathers explained. \"Depreciation accounts for 48 percent of the cost of ownership over the first five years.\" Different models depreciate faster, and more significantly, than others. In order to calculate depreciation for this owner-cost comparison, Consumer Reports started with the price that a typically-equipped model generally sells for. If a particular model often sells at a largely-discounted price that was also factored in. Consumer Reports then deducted the wholesale trade-in value of the car at the end of the period, based on data from their Used Car Price Service, Weathers explained. In those cases when Consumer Reports didn't have depreciation data for a new model, it used estimates based on comparable vehicles. The Fuel Factor . The second-biggest factor in cost-of-ownership, after depreciation, is fuel costs, which account for 21 percent of the total ownership costs. \"Fuel economy can really make a big difference,\" Weathers said. \"If you have a car that gets 25 miles per gallon, and another car that gets 19 miles per gallon, that's a potential difference of thousands of dollars over five years, if you're driving 12,000 miles a year.\" Consumer Reports calculated fuel costs by assuming that the vehicles would be driven 12,000 miles a year -- the average annual mileage reported by those who responded to Consumer Reports' annual reader survey. Consumer Reports then applied the national average price of regular gas as of December 2007 or, if applicable, the price of premium or diesel fuel. Fuel costs were an especially big factor with SUVs, the comparison revealed. Drivers who buy a Dodge Nitro could pay more than $10,000 to fill up the tank over a five-year period, for example. But the fuel costs for a similar-sized, more fuel-efficient Toyota RAV4 V6 would be $2,000 less during that period. Consumer Reports' comparison also concluded that interest paid on car loans accounts for about 12 percent of five-year ownership costs. That figure is based on a five-year loan, with a 15 percent down payment, using the average interest rate of 6.86 percent reported by Bankrate.com in December 2007. Auto insurance accounts for about 11 percent of total ownership costs over five years, according to the Consumer Reports comparison. Car insurance costs can vary depending on several factors such as the driver's age, location, and driving record. Auto insurance costs, in some cases, dramatically boosted the ownership costs of models that otherwise boasted reasonable ownership costs. As an example, Weathers compared the difference in auto insurance rates for Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution and a similarly-priced Acura TL. \"Insurance for the Lancer can cost you $2,500 a year or more, based our 2007 figures,\" notes Weathers. \"Meanwhile, the annual car insurance rates for the Acura TL can cost as little as $900.\" Maintenance & Repairs . Surprisingly, maintenance and car repairs account for only four percent of the cost of ownership, Weathers said. The maintenance and repair cost figures used in Consumer Reports' cost of ownership comparison were based on information gleaned from more than a million respondents in its annual Car Reliability Survey. One notable conclusion reached in the Consumer Reports study is that Lexus  models have relatively high maintenance and repair costs -- primarily due to maintenance alone, even though Lexus owners reported excellent reliability. The Lexus ES350 racks up an average of $2,300 in maintenance and repair in the first five years. Meanwhile, owners of a comparable Lincoln MKZ can expect to pay only half that much. Another interesting tidbit discovered in the comparison is that the Range Rover is the most expensive vehicle on average for five and eight years when it comes to maintenance and repairs, costing about $2,000 in the fifth year alone. Meanwhile, the comparable Toyota Land Cruiser costs only $600 in that year to maintain and repair. Some might be surprised to hear that the sales tax on the purchase price of the vehicle accounts for as much of the cost of ownership as maintenance and repairs. For its study, Consumer Reports used the national average of 4.83 percent in 2007. With hybrid cars being a hot topic in the auto industry, Consumer Reports was also interested in the cost of owning one of those fuel-sipping vehicles. The report concluded that Toyota Prius hybrid actually costs less to own than similar conventional models. Specifically, the sale price of a Prius is about $7,500 higher than a similarly-sized Chevrolet Cobalt, but the total cost of ownership over five years is almost $2,000 less - due primarily to its much lower fuel costs, although the amount of depreciation was a factor as well. Weathers pointed to another interesting finding: \"There are some vehicles, namely BMW, that are very inexpensive to own over first five years, because all of the maintenance is paid for during that period, under the warranty,\" he says. \"But if we take it forward, the cost of maintenance and repairs over the next three years after that is going to be more expensive.\" For more information on this study, visit www.ConsumerReports.org.

If you're passionate about the topic, he wants to hear from you. Roland Martin says the three presidential candidates will never be \"regular folks.\" (CNN) -- Can we all just stop the silly nonsense over who is an elitist and whether an \"average American\" will occupy the White House? Listening to the punditry today, you would think folks who revel in the comedy of Larry the Cable Guy or Katt Williams really would have a shot at the White House. It's totally absurd. So, Sen. Barack Obama is all of a sudden an elitist because he went to Columbia and Harvard? And Sen. Hillary Clinton is an elitist because she went to Yale? Do you actually think Sen. John McCain isn't an elitist? He went to an exclusive college -- the Naval Academy, and that is one of the hardest places to get into. (You can't even apply unless a member of Congress recommends you.) Karl Rove, who tries to portray himself as the common man but is just another rich Republican, has called both Democratic candidates elitists. Well, his former boss, President George W. Bush, went to Yale. So did Bush's dad, former president George H.W. Bush, and his granddaddy, former Sen. Prescott Bush. All three Bushes also were members of the super elite organization Skull and Bones. The younger Bush later went to Harvard. He walked into the governor's mansion and the presidency on the strength of his name and his dad's money and connections. Sounds like an elitist to me! But no, we're supposed to be fooled by the cowboy boots, folksy charm and him removing brush at his Crawford, Texas, ranch (don't forget the family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, where all the \"regular\" folks hang out). Surely you recall when Bush nominated Harriet Miers for the Supreme Court? Those same conservative voices decrying the elitist Democrats were blasting her because she went to little old Southern Methodist University, that unremarkable -- their view -- university in Dallas, Texas. (By the way, that will be the home of the George W. Bush Library.) You can bet a pitcher of beer that had she graduated from Harvard, Yale or Princeton, she wouldn't have been derisively referred to as too plain and not educated enough by the elitists in the Republican Party. And let's stay with the Supreme Court for a moment. Where did its members go to school? Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. -- Undergrad and law school, Harvard. Justice John Paul Stevens -- Undergrad: University of Chicago. Law school: Northwestern. Justice Antonin Scalia -- Undergrad: Georgetown University and the University of Fribourg, Switzerland. Law school: Harvard. Justice Anthony Kennedy -- Undergrad: Stanford University and the London School of Economics. Law school: Harvard. Justice David Souter -- Undergrad: Harvard; Magdalen College, Oxford; Oxford University. Law school: Harvard. Justice Clarence Thomas -- Undergrad: Holy Cross. Law school: Yale. Justice Ruth Ginsburg -- Undergrad: Cornell. Law school: Harvard (attended); finished at Columbia. Justice Stephen Breyer -- Undergrad, Stanford; Magdalen College, Oxford. Law school: Harvard. Justice Samuel Alito -- Undegrad: Princeton. Law school: Yale. That's pretty much an elite list of schools. We have deluded ourselves into thinking the person elected to the White House is really and truly like the rest of us. All three candidates don't know what it's like to face the daunting health care challenges millions of Americans are confronted with daily. Each are members of the U.S. Senate, and they have the best health care money can buy for life -- we pay for it! While your pension plan is shot to hell, their plan will NEVER be underfunded. The members will see to that, courtesy of taxpayer dollars. Forget how many times Obama bowls gutter balls, Clinton tosses back shots of whiskey and McCain talks about how he's a regular guy. Each, courtesy of their $169,300 annual salary, makes far more than the average American. And when it comes to wealth, Clinton gets to enjoy the $100 million she and her husband raked in since he left the White House (even their hefty book advances dwarf regular authors). McCain's wife, Cindy, runs one of Anheuser Busch's largest beer distributors and is worth more than $100 million. They will never be living paycheck-to-paycheck. Obama is the poorest of the three, but he did earn more than a million bucks courtesy of his best-selling books, \"The Audacity of Hope\" and \"Dreams from My Father\" after delivering his 2004 keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention. How many average Americans wouldn't mind having a million dollars in their savings account? Bottom line: The narrative about our presidential candidates being just regular folks is a tired myth that gets repeated each and every day. And their efforts to show that they are \"just like us\" are really pathetic. You don't have to go duck hunting, be seen buying milk at the grocery store for your family or having a beer at the local bar to show that you're \"one of us.\" Just do what rich and highly educated folks do when they are in politics: Advance policies that will at least allow me to keep a few more dollars in my pocket and be able to afford a home. One more thing: Don't buy fully into the nonsense tossed out by some of the loudest voices on television, radio and in print who decry these \"elitists\" and trumpet that they are for the blue collar, middle-class worker in middle America. Many of them pull down multimillion-dollar salaries and run into these same candidates on Martha's Vineyard and in the Hamptons when they all vacation. They, too, will pull every favor they have to get their children in the posh private schools and Ivy League institutions. Yes, we even have elitists in the media. Who would've thunkit?

They're part of Esperanza de Vida (Hope for Life), Salva's youth environmental group that is out to clean up the surroundings, one plastic bottle at a time. Salva, 49, was born and raised in the Jujuy province of northern Argentina, an area known for its rich culture and spectacular vistas -- \"the reason why most people fall in love with it,\" says Salva. But despite its beauty, Salva says there's no real environmental consciousness in her community. \"We have a lot of issues to work on -- the problem of water contamination; there's so much trash,\" Salva says. \"We can't just think that it will take care of itself.\" Salva, who has been a teacher in Jujuy for 20 years, says the environmental issues aren't recent ones. Ten years ago, she and her students noticed a lot of trash outside the school. \"The parks surrounding the school were littered with plastic bottles and beer bottles,\" recalls Salva. They began volunteering with a government program, collecting and bagging waste in the area. But the program waned after a year, and students and teachers could no longer continue their environmental efforts. \"Our city had no formal recycling program or even knowledge of why it was important to learn about fresh water, forestation, and the importance of recycling,\" says Salva. So Salva began Esperanza de Vida in 1997 to organize and lead young participants in \"making our streets and our environment cleaner.\" \"I believe that change begins with the youth,\" says Salva. \"They will teach future generations how to care for nature and everything that surrounds us.\" At first, the group's activities were limited to cleaning parks near and around the school. But the organization's efforts have expanded well beyond the immediate area, and other Jujuy schools have joined in. About 150 people now take part, including about 80 children. Salva says her students are deeply impacted by the \"Pachamama\" concept, or caring for Mother Earth.  She and fellow teachers have noticed their students apply as much energy and commitment to the weekend environmental activities as they do to their general subjects. \"Some even wait by my house on Saturday for the program to begin,\" beams Salva. The group convenes early in the morning to hike together into the mountains, where they work for hours, picking up trash and separating recyclables.  Watch Salva talk about her program's impact on the students and their environment \u00bb . \"We have long days and we accomplish a lot. It gets tiring because it's a lot of walking and sometimes there are cliffs,\" says Salva. \"[But] the students enjoy it a lot. They're making changes while having fun.\" On an average Saturday cleanup, it's not unusual for the group to collect roughly 60 bags of trash for recycling, clearing thousands of bottles from the mountains. The llamas help carry the heavy load down from the mountains. \"The children call them the little eco-llamas.\"  Watch Salva discuss another way the llamas help her group in the mountains \u00bb . The local government has also pitched in, helping to provide transport of the collected recyclables to the drop-off center, located nearly 50 miles from Tilcara.

Carmen says the children are even teaching their parents to care for the environment around them.

Measles is a respiratory disease whose familiar symptom is red blotches on the skin. In all but one of the cases, the people who contracted measles had not been vaccinated. Some were too young to have gotten the shots, which are administered from 12 to 15 months of age. The CDC released the statistics Thursday to \"serve as a reminder that measles can and still does occur in the U.S. Ongoing measles virus transmission was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but the risk of cases and outbreaks from imported disease remains,\" the organization said in a news release.

Amnesty International  protestors outside the US Supreme Court in January dressed as Guantanamo Bay detainees. The 398-page report comes 60 years after the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and Amnesty says governments still need to act on their promises. \"The biggest threat to the future of human rights is the absence of a shared vision and collective leadership,\" the organization said in a statement. Irene Khan, Amnesty's secretary-general, said that in particular, \"the human-rights flash points in Darfur, Zimbabwe, Gaza, Iraq and Myanmar demand immediate attention.\" The report, the group said, \"reveals a world riven by inequality, scarred by discrimination and distorted by political repression.\" According to its count, people are tortured or subject to other ill treatment in at least 81 countries, face unfair trials in at least 54 countries and are not allowed to express themselves freely in at least 77 countries. Of the 150 countries and regions listed in the report, Amnesty paid particular attention to China, the host of this summer's Olympic Games. The group said growing numbers of human rights activists were imprisoned or harassed in China in 2007, with ethnic and religious minorities -- including Tibetans, Falun Gong practitioners and Christians -- repressed or persecuted. Death penalty statistics in China are difficult to assess, Amnesty said, but based on public reports, the group estimated that at least 470 people were executed in 2007. Amnesty also noted the repression of free speech in China and said censorship of the Internet and other media intensified last year. \"The Chinese authorities maintained efforts to tightly control the flow of information,\" the report said. \"They decided what topics and news stories could be published, and media outlets were sometimes required to respond within minutes to government directives. The authorities continued to block Web sites and to filter Internet content based on specified words and topics.\" Around 30 journalists and at least 50 others are known to be in prison for posting their views online, Amnesty said. Amnesty also criticized the death penalty in the United States, where 42 people were executed last year. It noted New Jersey's decision in December to abolish the death penalty made it the first U.S. state in more than 40 years to do away with executions. As it has in previous annual reports, Amnesty criticized the detention of hundreds of foreign nationals at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. \"The USA must close Guantanamo detention camp and secret detention centers, prosecute the detainees under fair trial standards or release them, and unequivocally reject the use of torture and ill-treatment,\" Amnesty said. The group noted that Guantanamo detainees are held indefinitely, most of them without charge and without recourse to U.S. courts. Most detainees there are held in isolation in maximum-security facilities, heightening concerns for their physical and mental health, Amnesty said. In fact, more is written on the United States than any other country listed in the report. Asked about that at a press conference Tuesday, Khan said, \"We certainly devote a lot of time to Sudan, to China, to Zimbabwe and other countries. But we look to the U.S. to provide leadership around the world. Governments around the world look to the United States as a role model for their own behavior.\" In a lengthy section on Iraq, Amnesty noted that thousands of civilians, including children, were killed or injured in ongoing sectarian violence during 2007. \"All sides involved in the fighting committed gross human rights violations, some of which amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity,\" the report said. Abductions, torture and murder, with bodies left in the street, occur daily, and the violence has caused 2 million Iraqis to flee to Syria, Jordan and elsewhere, Amnesty said. U.S. forces held some 25,000 detainees \"without charge or trial,\" the group said, and 33 people were executed, \"some after grossly unfair trials.\" In Afghanistan, conflict and insecurity aggravated by drought and floods contributed to \"large-scale displacement\" of people throughout the year. \"At least 6,500 people were estimated to have been killed in the context of the conflict,\" the report said. \"Violations of international humanitarian and human rights law were committed with impunity by all parties, including Afghan and international security forces and insurgent groups.\" Russia must show greater tolerance for political dissent, Amnesty said. \"The Russian authorities were increasingly intolerant of dissent or criticism, branding it 'unpatriotic,' \" the report said. \"A crackdown on civil and political rights was evident throughout the year and in particular during the run-up to the State Duma [parliament] elections in December.\" The European Court of Human Rights ruled that Russia was responsible for enforced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial executions in 15 judgments relating to the recent conflict in Chechnya, Amnesty said. There were fewer reported disappearances in the Chechen Republic in 2007 than in previous years, Amnesty said, but continued human rights violations made people reluctant to report abuses. The report also criticized human rights conditions in Iran, Gaza and Myanmar. Human rights conditions in Zimbabwe continued to decline in 2007, the report said, \"with an increase in organized violence and torture and restrictions on the rights to freedom of association, assembly and expression.\" Members of the main opposition party, the MDC, along with other human rights defenders, were arrested, and many were tortured while in custody, Amnesty said. Some 4 million people required food aid because of the nation's deteriorating economy, and victims of forced evictions in 2005 continued to live in \"deplorable conditions\" while President Robert Mugabe's government failed to remedy their situation. \"Human rights problems are not isolated tragedies, but are like viruses that can infect and spread rapidly, endangering all of us,\" Khan said. \"Governments today must show the same degree of vision, courage and commitment that led the United Nations to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 60 years ago.\"", "f8ddc6d36f378757d27a244529f8fe11672baa41": "MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A judge has declared a mistrial in the retrial of six men accused of plotting terrorist acts with al Qaeda.

It is unclear whether the government will pursue a third trial against the defendants.

Rozita Swinton, 33, has been arrested in a case that is not directly related to the Texas raid. Texas Rangers are seeking Rozita Swinton of Colorado Springs, Colorado, \"regarding telephone calls placed to a crisis center hot line in San Angelo, Texas, in late March 2008,\" the Rangers said in a written statement. The raid of the YFZ (Yearning for Zion) Ranch in Eldorado, Texas, came after a caller -- who identified herself as a 16-year-old girl -- said she had been physically and sexually abused by an adult man with whom she was forced into a \"spiritual marriage.\" The release said a search of Swinton's home in Colorado uncovered evidence that possibly links her to phone calls made about the ranch, run by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. \"The possibility exists that Rozita Swinton, who has nothing to do with the FLDS church, may have been a woman who made calls and pretended she was the 16-year-old girl named Sarah,\" CNN's Gary Tuchman reported. Swinton, 33, has been charged in Colorado with false reporting to authorities and is in police custody. Police said that arrest was not directly related to the Texas case. Authorities raided the Texas ranch April 4 and removed 416 children. Officials have been trying to identify the 16-year-old girl, referred to as Sarah, who claimed she had been abused in the phone calls. FLDS members have denied the girl, supposedly named Sarah Jessop Barlow, exists. Some of the FLDS women who spoke with CNN on Monday said they believed the calls were a hoax. While the phone calls initially prompted the raid, officers received a second search warrant based on what they said was evidence of sexual abuse found at the compound. In court documents, investigators described seeing teen girls who appeared pregnant, records that showed men marrying multiple women and accounts of girls being married to adult men when they were as young as 13.

(CNN) -- With the political season in full swing, much is at stake for America. The economy is in a downward spiral. We have an energy crisis. Our jobless rate is on the rise. These are the subjects that generate headlines and much debate among the candidates. But there is an underlying problem that we as a nation have not addressed, a situation that should concern any American with an eye on the future, regardless of party affiliation. It is the crisis affecting our children: . \u2022 Nearly 30 percent of this year's freshman class will drop out of high school, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. That number jumps to 40 percent in some urban areas. \u2022 The obesity rate for our kids has gone up by as much as 300 percent since 1980, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, triggering a host of health-related problems, from diabetes to heart disease. \u2022 Young people account for more than 20 percent of violent crimes in the United States, according to statistics cited by Duke University's Center for Child and Family Policy. Violent juvenile crime peaks between 3 and 4 p.m., at the end of the school day. These facts are grim enough. Factor in persistent patterns of poverty, gang activity, drug abuse and teenage pregnancy, and you have a generation of Americans that will be unprepared -- indeed, unable -- to meet the challenges posed by a complex world. We expect our leaders to lead. But as citizens, we shouldn't simply sit back and hope that politicians stand up to the test.  We can participate in the political process, advocating for policies that will benefit the health, education and well-being of young Americans, because we must do a better job of preparing our youth to lead. It is daunting to think about solving such a widespread crisis. But there are youth-serving organizations that can and do play a key role in effecting positive change -- places such as Boys & Girls Clubs, with a long track record of helping young people turn things around, get an education, lead healthy lives and become effective leaders. I know, because I was one of those kids. Club staff taught me right from wrong and made the lesson stick. They planted the seeds early on that led me to envision myself as a high school graduate, a college graduate and an achiever in whatever field I chose. Boys & Girls Clubs do this today for millions of kids, offering everything from homework help to career exploration, performing a daily miracle that turns hope into opportunity. Urging children and the adults in their lives to \"Be Great,\" these clubs communicate the idea that there is potential for greatness in every child. This powerful call to action reminds us that we can all play a role in helping youth realize their dreams. So I ask you to join me in this effort. There are many ways to help: . \u2022 Volunteering at a local youth organization. \u2022 Leading by example. \u2022 Donating to charities that make a difference. In partnership with government, schools, community leaders and parents, we can create a network and culture in which everyone embraces the importance of a positive future for our youth. But right now, with Election Day fast approaching, ask your local, state and national candidates what they are doing to help our young people become tomorrow's leaders. Ask them to make children a top priority and tell them that you hold them accountable. If we all become advocates for our children, elected officials might just take action. We can do better. And if we care about our nation's future, we must do better.

Chanting and waving flags, the protesters ended their march at the Chinese consulate, where they sat in a dense group, holding flags and banners, as police watched from nearby. \"Stop killing,\" one sign read, while another said, \"No human rights, no Olympics.\" The protests came after passionate demonstrations in London and Paris in which protesters tried to snuff the torch's flame and dozens were arrested. Meanwhile, the Olympic flame was being kept in an undisclosed location in advance of Wednesday's planed 6-mile relay in San Francisco.  Watch how the city is preparing \u00bb . The run is the only U.S. appearance for the flame, wrapping up the first week of a 23-city global tour.

The IOC's executive board will discuss the torch relay \"in general\" Thursday or Friday, but there is no proposal on the agenda to end the global tour early, IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies said.  Watch the flame get the red-carpet treatment \u00bb . The official Beijing Olympics Web site, controlled by the Chinese organizers, gives little indication of any torch relay disruption. It characterizes the demonstrators as \"a small number\" of Tibetan separatists. Beijing blames the Dalai Lama and his followers for violence that erupted in March amid protests for Tibetan independence. China has drawn international criticism for its crackdown on the demonstrations, which began peacefully on the 49th anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising. China's Foreign Ministry Tuesday reacted forcefully to the torch relay protests. \"We express our strong condemnation to the deliberate disruption of the Olympic torch relay by Tibetan separatist forces regardless of the Olympic spirit and the law of Britain and France,\" China spokeswoman Jiang Yu said. \"Their despicable activities tarnish the lofty Olympic spirit and challenge all the people loving the Olympic Games around the world.\" The flame will return to China in May to begin a relay through the host nation, ending in Beijing with the August 8 opening of the Olympic Games. One of the San Francisco torchbearers has dropped out of Wednesday's relay because of fears of protests, a torch relay spokesman said. David Perry, spokesman for the San Francisco Olympic Torch Relay, said he did not want to release the name of the person. \"I understand anyone that might feel that they don't want to expose themselves to something more than protest,\" Perry said. On Monday, three protesters scaled San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge and raised a large banner. Those who climbed the cables from which the bridge's deck is suspended were members of Students for a Free Tibet, said group spokesman Tenzin Dasang, 22. They unfurled a banner that read: \"One World. One Dream. Free Tibet.\" The three climbers, along with four people on the ground, were charged with felony conspiracy and misdemeanor nuisance charges, said California Highway Patrol Officer Mary Ziegenbein. The climbers also were charged with misdemeanor trespassing. The Golden Gate Bridge protest came on the same day that thousands of protesters forced an abrupt halt to the flame's passage through Paris after 10 miles of the 17-mile planned route. Some stops were skipped and the flame was transferred from the torch back to the lamp to be carried on a bus several times to avoid protesters. Protesters pierced the thick security bubble surrounding the torchbearers, at times getting their hands on the torch itself. The Paris demonstrations were similar to those Sunday in London, where at least 36 people were arrested, according to London Metropolitan Police. Protesters cited China's actions in Tibet, its policies on the Darfur region of Sudan and the lack of civil rights and freedoms for the Chinese people. But other demonstrators, bearing Chinese flags, turned out in support of the Chinese government, and many others were spectators there just to see the torch. An Olympic committee member suggested Monday that the public relations nightmare that has followed the Olympic flame on its way to the Summer Games in Beijing may make 2008 the last time such an ambitious global torch relay is attempted.  Follow the torch relay itinerary \u00bb . International Olympic Committee member Richard Kevan Gosper, who is also chairman of the IOC's press committee, told reporters he was always opposed to a global tour for the flame. \"I'm a firm believer that we had the right template in the first place, that the torch simply should go from Olympia, Greece, to the host country,\" Gosper said.

Middlesbrough have decided against taking up the option of re-signing Brazilian midfielder Fabio Rochemback. The Premier League club had an option to extend Brazilian Rochemback's deal by another two years, but manager Gareth Southgate has decided to let him go. \"We both feel that the time is right for Fabio to have a fresh challenge,\" Southgate said. \"He is a talented footballer and I think he's just had his best season for us, while it was fitting that he should bow out against Manchester City on Sunday with probably his best performance in a Middlesbrough shirt.\" The 26-year-old joined Boro from Barcelona in 2005 and played 91 games for the Teesside club. He signed off in style by scoring a thumping long-range free-kick in Sunday's 8-1 victory over City. Rochemback, who netted seven times for Boro, played a major role in helping the club reach the 2006 UEFA Cup final, a year after appearing in the final during a loan spell with Sporting Lisbon -- where he is expected to move back to this summer. Mendieta, 34, was one of football's costliest players when he joined Lazio from Valencia for 48 million euros in 2001, but he disappointed and joined Barcelona and then Boro on loan. The former Spain midfielder joined permanently on a free transfer in 2004, but has not played for the first team since December 26, 2006. \"It was a difficult situation for a player of Gaizka's caliber to find himself out of the first team reckoning,\" added Southgate. \"I made it clear to him that he did not figure in my plans but he decided to stay and try to get back into the first team. \"That didn't work out but his attitude to training was always excellent and he was a good influence on some of our young reserve team players.\" South Korean international Lee joined Boro on a free transfer from Pohang Steelers in January 2007. He scored only twice in 11 starts and 18 appearances as a substitute and has not appeared for the first team since early February. Southgate is still hopeful of persuading goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer to sign a new contract at the Riverside. The 35-year-old Australian joined Boro from Bradford City in a $3 million deal in February 1997 and has played nearly 450 games for the club. His deal runs out this summer and he has so far refused to sign an extension, prompting reports of interest from a host of European clubs. \"We are talking to Mark. I'd like him to stay. His experience is important but he has real drive and determination that is still increasing,\" said Southgate. \"He is the one in our dressing room that can truly say he has played at the highest level -- in World Cups, in Europe, in cup finals and so on. \"We have to negotiate and see where we go, but players have to want to stay here and we have to want to keep them. \"Mark has been here a long time so he has to decide if he needs a fresh challenge, whether what we are trying to do is going to excite him, whether he feels he is going to be appreciated here.\" Southgate also confirmed they have offered striker Tom Craddock and right-back Tony McMahon one-year extensions to their current deals, which run out this summer. Brazilian Rivaldo has changed his mind about retiring and says he will play for Greek club AEK again next season. The 36-year-old had decided to quit after AEK were denied the title because Olympiakos were awarded three points for a game they lost after the opposing team fielded an ineligible player. \"The truth is that at the end of the championship, I felt great disappointment and a (sense of) injustice, but the love and support I have received from fans and the team have contributed to my final decision ... I have decided to stay at AEK next season,\" Rivaldo said in a statement on the club's Web site. Olympiakos lost 1-0 on February 3, but Greek sports authorities gave them the points because Apollon played Roman Wallner who had turned out for two other clubs during the season. Apollon's appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport was rejected on April 21. Olympiakos finished the season with 70 points, two ahead of AEK, for their 11th title in 12 years. Rivaldo, who has played at AC Milan and Barcelona and starred in Brazil's 2002 World Cup victory, spent three seasons at Olympiakos from 2004. He moved to AEK last year after a contract dispute. Tottenham midfielder Jamie O'Hara has signed a new three-year contract with the club. The 21-year-old made his debut this season and went on to score two goals in a total 25 appearances. \"He has come a long way in a short space of time so I congratulate him and this new contract is recognition of his efforts,\" said manager Juande Ramos. \"Jamie is an example to all the young players at the club in that reaching the first team can be achieved through hard work and giving the best of yourself.\" However, Tottenham goalkeeper Radek Cerny has left the club. The 34-year-old Czech international, who was on loan from Sparta Prague, has joined ambitious Championship club Queens Park Rangers on a two-year contract.", "e2866f596c85b0191ce812260d23855c70a01192": "(CNN) -- English club Birmingham City have released a statement to explain why co-owner and managing director were interviewed by police in a corruption probe.

The club released a statement on Thursday afternoon to \"clarify the situation\" before trading resumed at 1300 GMT. \"The City of London Police investigation is focusing on payments to a football agent and two players dating back to 2002-03,\" it said. \"There is absolutely no allegation that any director of the company or the club itself has benefited financially from any of this activity. \"In so far as there may be any implications for the company, these are not considered material to its financial affairs and they are in relation to the payment, or possible non payment of PAYE and National Insurance contributions.

The club said at the time that the inquiries related to an unrelated third party. Birmingham released a statement on Wednesday night confirming that Sullivan and Brady \"willingly attended\" the interviews \"by long-standing appointment.\" \"Birmingham City Football Club is fully committed to helping the police with their inquiries,\" read a statement on the club's Web site.

This photo, taken by Warner Glenn in 1996, is believed to be the first of a live jaguar in the United States. When most people think of jaguars, they think of the jungles of Central and South America, not the remote desert ranges between the United States and Mexico. That region is known as mountain lion country, and that's what rancher Warner Glenn thought he was tracking when he saddled up his mules on a summer day 12 years ago near Douglas, Arizona. Glenn has hunted mountain lions for 60 years, since he was eight years old. But Glenn was stunned when he saw what his hunting dogs had chased up to a high mountain perch. The rancher took what's believed to be the first photo of a live jaguar in the United States. But it wasn't his last. In 2006, some 40 miles away, Glenn and his hunting party again cornered a jaguar -- a different one. Jaguars, an endangered species, have a breeding population in northern Mexico. Scientists believe there are no more than 120 left in the wild there. It's believed that since 1910, the cats are only visitors north of the border. They have been virtually unstudied here until recently. But Glenn and other conservationists worry that the possible return of breeding jaguars to the United States could be stopped in its tracks. The reason: the border fence. Last month the Department of Homeland Security waived 30 environmental laws to finish 470 miles of the fence by the end of the year. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told Congress that the agency continues to talk to some 600 landowners along the border to get their input. But in order to comply with the congressional mandate, he said, there is no time to deal with \"unnecessary delays caused by administrative processes or potential litigation.\" \"We are currently in a lawless situation at the border,\" says Chertoff. \"I feel an urgency to get this tactical infrastructure in. And although we're going to be respectful of the environment, we're going to be expeditious.\" Two environmental groups, Defenders of Wildlife and the Sierra Club, have filed appeals with the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming the waivers are unconstitutional and set a dangerous precedent. \"National security and environmental protection do not have to be at odds with each other,\" says Defenders of Wildlife spokesman Matt Clark. \"If we can drop this arbitrary deadline for constructing the fence and go through the proper procedures, then there are inevitably ways to minimize environmental impact, but as it is now it's throwing all of those laws out the window.\" Mountain lion tracker Jack Childs also worries about the impact of the fence on local wildlife, especially the jaguar. Childs captured the first video of a live jaguar in the late summer of 1996, a few months after Warner Glenn.  Watch Childs and Glenn talk about efforts to preserve the jaguar \u00bb . \"I knew historically there had been a few jaguars sighted in Arizona but in the last hundred years never in any numbers.\" His encounter sparked a passion for the big cats. Along with wife Anna and biologist Emil McCain, he created the Borderlands Jaguar Detection Project.  See images of the controversy \u00bb . Childs and McCain hike into remote mountain areas where the jaguars roam and have placed more than 50 motion sensor cameras near the border. They've taken 69 photos of three different jaguars since 2001, including several of the same cat Childs first saw in 1996. He has nicknamed that cat Macho B. A jaguar's spots are like fingerprints -- each cat has a unique set. One of the spots on Macho B resembles a Pinocchio cartoon figure, and that's how they identify him. \"We spend a lot of time walking along the border during the daytime, and we actually find his tracks going through the fence, so we know for sure that he crosses back and forth,\" says Childs. \"A fence like that is going to inhibit wildlife movements and migrations back and forth. It's not going to effectively stop human traffic. They've got wire cutters and torches.\"  See where the jaguars have been spotted \u00bb . Childs says the fence also has an impact on wildlife because drug runners and human traffickers have been pushed up into the mountain areas to avoid the fence in the lowland valleys. \"It's impacting the animals number one, what's going on down there. It's almost brought my wildlife study to a stop because they (the traffickers) are tearing down my cameras as fast as I'm putting them up because they think we're taking pictures of them.\" The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service finds itself in a unique position. Its mission is wildlife and habitat protection, but it must uphold another federal agency's mission to override environmental concerns. Bill Radke, manager of the San Bernardino Wildlife Refuge, says the Border Patrol is trying to work with his agency. \"The hope is that by working with Border Patrol that we can meet the national security mandate and at the same time protect the wildlife,\" says Radke. \"Border Patrol is putting up camera towers but are putting them up on areas that are off the refuge. They're working on barriers but not barriers that would impede wildlife and large animals like jaguars.\" At 6 foot 6, with steely blue eyes, dressed in leather chaps astride his mule, rancher Warner Glenn is every inch the American cowboy. And he is a man forever changed by his encounters with the jaguar. He has written a book, \"Eyes of Fire,\" about his experience. He says he'd like to \"invite Mr. Bush to come out on a mule\" so he can see \"what's going on here in these mountains.\" For Glenn, the cat represents all that is wild about the Southwest. \"It would be a loss to me that maybe my granddaughter or my daughter wouldn't be able to see one like I have. It's just an animal that's a beautiful, magnificent cat and they're having a little bit of trouble surviving. But they're doing it, and I would hate to see us do anything that would cause the survival of that cat to go backwards. \"I'm a livestock rancher, but I wouldn't mind donating a few calves to that jaguar, so to speak.\" Biologist Emil McCain agrees. \"They are part of our natural heritage. They are part of the American West. They are part of the American wild as much as the bald eagle or the grizzly bear, and the jaguar is really special because it is such an elusive and beautiful creature [that] it evokes a sense of imagination and curiosity about the natural world.\" Though the jaguar is elusive, conservationists say the animal is caught -- in the political crossfire at the border.

Chad President Idriss Deby, right, and Sudan's President Omar al-Beshir, left, shake hands after signing the pact. The signing came after nearly two full days of talks in Dakar, Senegal, between Sudan President Omar al-Beshir and Idriss Deby, the president of Chad. Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade facilitated the talks, and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon met with officials from both nations and witnessed the signing of the agreement at about 10 p.m. \"The idea is to get the governments of Sudan and Chad to normalize their relations with each other and to halt any action that would allow for the cross-border movement of rebel factions or armed factions of either side that could hurt the other country,\" said United Nations spokesman Farhan Haq. Each country accuses the other of supporting armed rebel groups that cross the border to attempt to destabilize the government. The rival nations' armies have skirmished several times. The United Nations says refugees and armed groups have been regularly crossing the border between the troubled Darfur region of Sudan and Chad. They allegedly include many of the rebels that attacked N'Djamena, the capital of Chad, in early February. As recently as Thursday, just hours before the agreement was signed, Chad issued a communique saying rebels from Sudan had crossed the border. Chad is still recovering from a failed attempt last month by rebels to overthrow Deby's regime. The United Nations says the swelling number of Darfur refugees and other displaced people living in eastern Chad is causing serious strain on the region. Kingsley Amaning, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Chad, said more than 10,000 people from Darfur, in Sudan, have fled into 12 official refugee camps in eastern Chad. They join some 240,000 Darfurians who have lived in Chad since 2004 because of fighting in their homeland and an estimated 180,000 displaced Chadians also living there. The number of displaced Chadians is growing because of the recent fighting there, Kingsley said. Haq said the United Nations, which has peacekeeping troops in the Darfur region, will work to assure Sudan and Chad carry out the terms of Thursday's deal.

Viktor Bout is accused of selling missiles, rockets and other weapons to FARC, a Colombian rebel group. Viktor Bout, who was recently captured in Thailand, had agreed to sell the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) surface-to-air missiles, armor-piercing rocket launchers, \"ultralight\" airplanes, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other weapons, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a news release. There was no immediate public response from Bout, who remains in custody in Thailand. Federal authorities unsealed an indictment charging Bout with four terrorism offenses: conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals, conspiracy to kill U.S. officers or employees, conspiracy to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile, and conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. FARC is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department. Justice Department officials said they are seeking Bout's extradition to the United States. The indictment alleges that Bout made agreements with FARC between November 2007 and March of this year. In their news release, federal prosecutors said Bout agreed to sell weapons \"to two confidential sources\" working with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, who had \"represented that they were acquiring these weapons for the FARC, with the specific understanding that the weapons were to be used to attack United States helicopters in Colombia.\" The news release also refers to a \"covertly recorded meeting in Thailand on March 6, 2008.\" \"With the unsealing of this indictment, we are one step closer to ensuring Bout has delivered his last load of high-powered weaponry and armed his final terrorist,\" DEA Acting Administrator Michele M. Loenhart said in the news release.

Penn is CEO of public relations giant Burson-Marsteller and is president of Penn, Schoen and Berland, his political consulting firm. Friday, he acknowledged he had met with the Colombian ambassador to the United States earlier in the week in his role as Burson-Marsteller's chief to discuss the pending U.S.-Colombia trade pact, which Clinton has criticized on the campaign trail. Penn called the meeting \"an error in judgment that will not be repeated,\" and apologized. That prompted Colombia's government to fire the company Saturday, calling the remarks \"a lack of respect to Colombians.\" Clinton and top aides were sharply critical of rival Democrat Barack Obama in February when reports indicated that his top economic adviser had suggested to a Canadian official that Obama was not as supportive of changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement as the Illinois senator claimed to be on the campaign trail. Penn said Friday that Clinton's opposition to the U.S.-Colombia pact, which the Bush administration is trying to push through Congress, \"is clear and was not discussed\" during his meeting with the ambassador. And Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee said Penn's meeting was \"not in any way done on behalf of the campaign.\" But Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell -- a key Clinton backer in his state's April 22 primary -- suggested Sunday that Penn needed to go. \"I think you've got to make it very clear for someone who is a consultant, who you are representing and who you are not representing, and I would hope that Mr. Penn, when he talked to the Colombians, made that clear.

David Perry, spokesman for the San Francisco Olympic Torch Relay, said he did not want to release the name of the person. \"I understand anyone that might feel that they don't want to expose themselves to something more than protest,\" Perry said. On Monday, three protesters scaled San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge and raised a large banner. Those who climbed the cables from which the bridge's deck is suspended were members of Students for a Free Tibet, said group spokesman Tenzin Dasang, 22. They unfurled a banner that read: \"One World. One Dream. Free Tibet.\" The three climbers, along with four people on the ground, were charged with felony conspiracy and misdemeanor nuisance charges, said California Highway Patrol Officer Mary Ziegenbein. The climbers also were charged with misdemeanor trespassing. The Golden Gate Bridge protest came on the same day that thousands of protesters forced an abrupt halt to the flame's passage through Paris after 10 miles of the 17-mile planned route. Some stops were skipped and the flame was transferred from the torch back to the lamp to be carried on a bus several times to avoid protesters. Protesters pierced the thick security bubble surrounding the torchbearers, at times getting their hands on the torch itself. The Paris demonstrations were similar to those Sunday in London, where at least 36 people were arrested, according to London Metropolitan Police. Protesters cited China's actions in Tibet, its policies on the Darfur region of Sudan and the lack of civil rights and freedoms for the Chinese people. But other demonstrators, bearing Chinese flags, turned out in support of the Chinese government, and many others were spectators there just to see the torch. An Olympic committee member suggested Monday that the public relations nightmare that has followed the Olympic flame on its way to the Summer Games in Beijing may make 2008 the last time such an ambitious global torch relay is attempted.  Follow the torch relay itinerary \u00bb . International Olympic Committee member Richard Kevan Gosper, who is also chairman of the IOC's press committee, told reporters he was always opposed to a global tour for the flame. \"I'm a firm believer that we had the right template in the first place, that the torch simply should go from Olympia, Greece, to the host country,\" Gosper said.

Skybus Airlines joins ATA and Aloha Airlines, which announced shutdowns earlier this week. The low-cost carrier couldn't overcome \"the combination of rising jet fuel costs and a slowing economic environment,\" the company said Friday. \"These two issues proved to be insurmountable for a new carrier.\" Skybus, an Ohio-based airline founded in 2004, will cease operations effective Saturday. Earlier in the week, ATA Airlines and Aloha Airlines announced they would shut down flights as both companies work through bankruptcy filings. ATA, an Indiana-based low-cost charter airline, filed for Chapter 11 status Wednesday as a result of financial problems \"following the loss of a key contract for our military charter business,\" the company said. The company started operation in 1973. Hawaii-based Aloha Airlines announced Sunday it would shut down its passenger operations this week after filing for bankruptcy protections last month, concluding 61 years of service. In its bankruptcy filing, Aloha said it was unable to generate enough revenue from its inter-island passenger flights because of below-cost fares by competitors Mesa Air Group's go! airline. The company said it was forced to match the competitor's fares during an unprecedented increase in the cost of jet fuel. Skybus said all flights Friday would be completed; passengers with reservations for Saturday and beyond were told to seek refunds from their credit card companies.

The U.S. military handed him over Thursday at Yokosuka Naval Base, south of Tokyo. A Yokosuka police spokesman identified the sailor as Olatunbosun Ogbogu, a 22-year-old Nigerian national. Taxi driver Masaaki Takahashi, 61, was found dead March 19 of stab wounds to the neck about a mile from the base in Yokosuka. The presence of U.S. in Japan has sparked controversy this year amid reports linking service members to crimes. In March, the U.S. military said it plans to court martial four Marines accused of raping a 19-year-old woman in Hiroshima last year. Authorities are also investigating allegations that a member of the U.S. military raped a Philippine woman on the island of Okinawa. And a U.S. Marine was detained in the rape of a 14-year-old girl until the girl dropped the allegations. As Ogbogu was arrested, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, Thomas Schieffer, met with Japan's foreign minister. \"We're dealing with human beings that do criminal acts from time to time,\" Schieffer told reporters afterward. \"And I think justice is going to be done in this matter because we've been able to work so closely together.\"  Watch the U.S. ambassador to Japan discuss the case \u00bb .

Keanu Reeves, second from left, and Forest Whitaker are shifty cops in \"Street Kings.\" The movie is textbook Cop Noir. Directed by David Ayer, who wrote \"Training Day\" and directed \"Harsh Times,\" from a script that originated with \"L.A. Confidential\" novelist James Ellroy, it's a story both men have told before and will doubtless return to again. Too bad that story -- the one about the constant struggle with an impure world, betrayal, disillusionment, retribution, all that jazz -- isn't told with much originality this time around. As Ludlow, a detective with a special LAPD vice squad, Reeves shoots first and asks questions much, much later. In his field the bad guys are easy to spot, and if Tom has to get his hands dirty, well, then he'll be careful to wipe away the residue before he calls it in. He works from the gut. We have Ludlow's number from the beginning: He wakes up, vomits, cleans his gun, and knocks back a couple of miniature bottles of vodka. Then he crashes a kidnappers' den and puts down four gangsters before they know what's hit them. \"Don't worry,\" he tells the distraught little girls caged up in the back. \"I'm a cop.\" It's probably superfluous to add that he's still nursing a grievous hangover from the wife who died in flagrante with a person unknown two or three years ago. It's also probably superfluous to mention that Internal Affairs (headed by Hugh Laurie) is beginning to sniff around Ludlow's unit. In particular, IA is talking to his ex-partner Washington (Terry Crews), a revelation that sends Ludlow reaching for his baseball bat. Before he can put Washington straight, though, his old pal is gunned down before his eyes by a couple of punks. Can Ludlow cover up his own potentially incriminating presence at the scene and still track down the cop killers? Hell, yes, even if he has to alienate everyone in the department before he's through. Reeves doesn't do much \"acting\" as such, but he doesn't need to: His performance is clean and spare, in synch with Ayer's clipped economy, and he has a doleful quality that goes some way to redeem a nasty and wretchedly na\u00efve character. Alcoholism doesn't appear to have thrown off Ludlow's aim any, but it must have dulled his reasoning. A broody, intuitive detective should be able to piece together this boilerplate mystery without too much head-scratching, but Ludlow never stops to look even two steps ahead. (I guess he's not a James Ellroy fan.) But what he lacks in insight he makes up for in sheer determination, not to say blood-lust. In a neat touch, when it's time to cool off his public profile for a spell, the rogue cop is transferred to a desk in the complaints department -- surely his idea of purgatory, and, obviously, an utterly pointless occupation. Forest Whitaker boosts the energy level as Ludlow's paternalistic mentor, boss, and No. 1 fan: \"You're the tip of the spear,\" he tells him. \"Who else is going to hold back the animals?\" Violent and cynical and a shade or two overdetermined, \"Street Kings\" ably demonstrates the pitfalls embedded in the pragmatics of \"a necessary evil,\" or anyone who sets himself up as a law unto himself, but ultimately it can't conceive of a better alternative. After all, the rest is politics, a game that even the most hard-boiled anti-hero would never lower himself to enter.

An aerial view taken last year shows some living quarters at polygamist leader Warren Jeffs' Texas ranch. Authorities have sealed off the 1,900-acre ranch near Eldorado and no one is allowed to enter or leave, officials with Child Protective Services and the Department of Public Safety said. The people living at the ranch are cooperating, authorities said. Escorted by police, social workers entered the compound in south central Texas at 8 p.m. Thursday after receiving \"a referral,\" said Child Protective Services spokeswoman Marleigh Meisner.  Watch police seal off the compound \u00bb . Child Protective Services \"is conducting an investigation into safety issues of the children who live within the compound,\" she said. Meisner would not provide details about the referral but did say officials responded \"within days\" of receiving it. As of Friday morning, Meisner added, her agency had \"not determined that there is a safety issue with these children.\" Several law enforcement agencies are assisting with the investigation, said Tela Mange, of the Texas Department of Public Safety. \"The people at the ranch have been cooperative and they are providing the investigators with everyone they want to talk to,\" she said. Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) bought 1,900 acres near Eldorado four years ago and built the ranch, which they call the YFZ Ranch. It is now home to as many as 400 members who relocated from their Arizona and Utah compounds. Jeffs, the 52-year-old leader and \"prophet\" of the 10,000-member church, was convicted in Utah last year on two counts of being an accomplice to rape, charges related to a marriage he performed in 2001. He still faces trial in Arizona on eight charges of sexual conduct with a minor, incest and conspiracy. State and local law enforcement agencies set up roadblocks around the ranch Thursday evening, preventing journalists from seeing what was happening on the property, according to Randy Mankin, editor of the Eldorado Success weekly newspaper. \"This came totally out of the blue,\" Mankin said. There were no indications of any violence around the ranch, he said. When CNN crews have visited the ranch, it was guarded by armed men equipped with night vision gear and other high-tech surveillance tools to prevent intruders. When CNN flew over the ranch in a small plane last year, the crew saw a massive temple, the three-story housing units where Jeffs' chosen followers live, the water tower, the school and community center, the dairy and cheese factory and a massive concrete mill. The FLDS church openly practices polygamy in two towns straddling the Arizona-Utah state line -- Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona., but members living on their Texas ranch rarely venture into Eldorado, four miles to the south. Critics of the sect say it arranges marriages for girls as young as 13, and that competition for brides may be reduced through exiling young men. If male followers are excommunicated, the critics claim, their wives and children can be reassigned to someone else. Jeffs is now being held in the Mohave County Jail in Kingman, Arizona, where he will be tried on charges of being an accomplice to incest and sex with minors. In November ,Jeffs was sentenced to 10 years in jail after being convicted of two charges of accomplice to rape.

Mikhail Gorbachev told CNN's Larry King that Russia called extra troops into Georgia to stem violence. Gorbachev told CNN's Larry King that Russia moved additional forces into South Ossetia in response to \"devastation\" in the South Ossetia city of Tskhinvali. \"This was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town, against a sleeping people. This was a barbaric assault,\" said Gorbachev, the last president of the former Soviet Union. But Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, who also appeared on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" Thursday, said he was \"profoundly shocked\" that Mikhail Gorbachev would use a television appearance \"for basically vindicating lies and deceptions.\" Last week, Georgia said it launched an operation into South Ossetia after a cease-fire was broken with artillery fire from Russian separatists that killed 10 people including civilians and peacekeepers. It accused Russia, which also has peacekeepers in the region, of backing the separatists. Hours later, the Russian news agency Interfax reported that Russian authorities said 10 Russian peacekeepers had been killed and 30 wounded in an attack by Georgians. \"Western television didn't show what happened in Tskhinvali,\" Gorbachev said. \"Only now they're beginning to show some pictures of the destruction.

The Indian Embassy in Kabul was badly damaged in the July 7 bombing. Pakistan strongly denied the allegation Friday, but Afghanistan and India have previously accused Pakistan of involvement in the attack which killed 58 people including an Indian defense attache. The official told CNN the evidence was not strong enough to draw a firm conclusion but there is a \"strong suspicion\" the Taliban was behind the attack, and that some unspecified aid came from Pakistan's Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. The official would not say how the intelligence was gathered, but he said the evidence was presented to senior Pakistani officials by a top CIA official, Deputy Director Stephen Kappes. The New York Times, sourcing U.S. government officials, reported Friday that the United States intercepted communications between Pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack in Kabul. Pakistani Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said the report \"unfounded and malicious\" and an \"effort to malign the ISI,\" -- Pakistan's Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence. The bombing killed 58 people. \"The ISI is a very disciplined organization, manned by military officials. It has played the most crucial role in the war on terror and apprehended members of al Qaeda, the Taliban, and those linked to the attack on mainland America on 9/11,\" Abbas said. Abbas said \"despite our insistence, no evidence has been provided to us about these allegations.\" Afghanistan claims Pakistan informally supports militants operating from havens in Pakistan's lawless tribal regions near the porous 1,500-mile border the two countries share. Earlier this month, Afghan lawmakers directly accused Pakistan's ISI in connection with a string of attacks in Afghanistan. Among these were the Kabul strike and an assassination attempt on Afghan President Hamid Karzai at an April 27 military ceremony. A senior Afghan government official said the charges were based on phone intercepts of conversations of plotters in Kabul with ISI officers in Pakistan. A U.S. government official, who would not comment on the specifics of the New York Times story, said, \"We've long noted the troubling reports of a relationship between the ISI and the Taliban, and the incident at the Indian Embassy seems to fit the pattern of those reports.\" India has previously blamed militants from Pakistan for the July 7 car bombing at the embassy.

Watch Pakistan deny the allegations \u00bb . \"There seems to be a bit of sensationalism in this story,\" Hasan said. He said the government has regularly denied claims that ISI is involved with militants in Afghanistan and noted that Pakistan has been cooperating in the fight against terrorism. Gul said the claims are \"preposterous\" and \"totally false,\" and cautioned that the CIA has been proven to be wrong about intelligence in the past. The New York Times report also sourced the U.S. officials as saying \"there was new information showing that members of the Pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the American campaign against them, in some cases allowing militants to avoid American missile strikes in Pakistan's tribal areas.\" Pakistan and Afghanistan have a tumultuous past. During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, religious schools in Pakistan helped train fighters who battled the Soviets. After the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 1996 and imposed fundamentalist rule, Pakistan was one of the few countries that recognized the regime diplomatically. It dropped its support after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on Washington and New York.

Three years after succeeding Pope John Paul II, Benedict is likely to address the sex scandal within the Catholic Church, the church's relationship with other faiths, the U.S.-led war in Iraq and the upcoming U.S. presidential election, said John Allen, a CNN Vatican analyst. The fallout from the sex scandal has had a serious impact on the U.S. Catholic Church in terms of its finances, its moral authority and the demoralization of Catholics.

The centerpiece of the Washington leg of the U.S. visit will be Thursday's Mass at Nationals Park, a new baseball stadium where 46,000 people will gather to watch the pope.

Despite three years as the head of the Catholic Church, the pope remains a bit of a mystery to many American Catholics. \"I think most American Catholics may not know a whole lot about him,\" Allen said. \"He's not the sexy media icon that John Paul II was, but what they've seen, by and large, they've liked.\" Of American Catholics polled by the Pew Research Center, 74 percent give Pope Benedict a favorable rating. But the survey points out that he's not as highly regarded as his predecessor.  See other meetings between popes and presidents \u00bb . For one, their personalities are different. John Paul was known for his charisma. Benedict is known as an intellectual and introvert. \"He doesn't quite get the same energy from crowds that John Paul II got,\" said Cardinal Francis George, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. \"John Paul II was extroverted and got energy talking to people, and the present Holy Father loses energy.

The teenagers seen in a video assaulting a 16-year-old could face life in prison. The suspects, who range in age from 14 to 18, all face charges of kidnapping, which is a first-degree felony, and battery, said Chip Thullbery, a spokesman for the Polk County state attorney. Three of them are also charged with tampering with a witness. Everyone involved in the case was under a gag order imposed by a judge. The only attorney for the teens who has been publicly identified did not return calls from CNN, and his assistant cited the gag order as the reason. The teens are scheduled for their first appearance in court Friday. The video shows a brutal scene: The 16-year-old victim is punched, kneed and slapped by other girls. She huddles in the fetal position, or stands and screams at her attackers, but the assault continues. Authorities say the eight teens said they were retaliating for insults posted on the Internet by the attack victim. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd called the March 30 attack \"animalistic.\" \"I've been involved in law enforcement for 35 years, and I've seen a lot of extremely violent events, but I've never seen children, 14 to 18 years of age, engage in this conduct for a 30-minute period of time and then make these video clips,\" he said. Police say the teens planned to post the video on YouTube.  Watch the disturbing video \u00bb . The victim, a 16-year-old from Lakeland, Florida, was hospitalized, and still has blurred vision, hearing loss, and a swollen face, her mother told CNN on Wednesday. The video shows only girls doing the beating; Judd said the boys acted as lookouts. The idea of girls administering a vicious beating so they can post the video online may seem shocking, but it's becoming an increasingly common scenario, according to experts and news reports.  Watch why more teens are putting fights online \u00bb . A search for \"girl fight\" on YouTube gets thousands of results, and a suggestion to also try \"girl fight at school, boy girl fight\" and other search terms. There's at least one Web site devoted exclusively to videos of girls fighting. In 2003, 25 percent of high school girls said they had been in a physical fight in the past year, according to a survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (The figure for boys was 40.5 percent.) A Justice Department report released in 2006 showed that by age 17, 21 percent of girls said they had assaulted someone with the intent to cause serious harm. Frank Green is executive director of Keys to Safer Schools, a group that studies and tries to prevent school violence. He said he's not sure whether girls have actually become more violent, or whether there's just more awareness of their fights. \"In one respect, girls have always been more vicious than boys,\" Green said. \"Their violence is of a personal nature.\" He said boys usually have some focus and a concrete goal when they fight. \"But girls want to cause pain and make the other girl feel bad,\" he said. Judd, the Polk County sheriff, said an important part of the plan in the Lakeland attack was to post the video of the beating on YouTube to humiliate and embarrass the victim. \"It's the next stage of cyberbullying,\" psychologist Susan Lipkins said. \"They want to show what they're doing.\" \"Our kids are being peer pressured, in another sense of a trend, to put these shock videos out there at other peoples' expense,\" said Talisa Lindsay, the victim's mother. \"And I hope that it doesn't come to the point where there's more people's lives that are being affected by having to take a beating for entertainment, or possibly being killed.\"  Watch mother describe how the victim is doing \u00bb . The suspects didn't have a chance to post the video online before police moved in and seized it, Judd said. The Sheriff's Department made it public, and it wound up on YouTube anyway. Judd recognizes the irony. \"In a perverted sense, we were feeding into exactly what the kids wanted,\" he said. \"But according to Florida law, [the video] is public record, and it's going to be in the public domain whether we agree with that or not.\" Judd said the suspects showed no remorse when they were arrested and booked. \"They were laughing and joking about, 'I guess we won't get to go to the beach during spring break.' And one ... asked whether she could go to cheerleading practice,\" he said. Lipkins, the psychologist, says there's a \"disconnect between their actions and their thoughts.\" \"They think the entire society is doing it, and they think it's funny. So they put it on YouTube.

CNN's Rich Phillips contributed to this report.", "9177e5ac94f038749e8d4eb526a65461e0f6df4c": "(CNN) -- The following are excerpts from the Heather Mills-Paul McCartney divorce ruling, issued by the Honorable Mr. Justice Bennett. Dollar figures are based on the current exchange rate of approximately two dollars per British pound: . Heather Mills' case \"boils down to the syndrome of 'me, too,' \" said the judge. On Mills' finances: . \"I have to say I cannot accept the wife's case that she was wealthy and independent by the time she met the husband in the middle of 1999. Her problem stems from the lack of any documentary evidence to support her case as to the level of her earnings. I do not doubt her commitment to charitable causes ... [but] I find that the wife's case as to her wealth in 1999 to be wholly exaggerated. The assertion that she was a wealthy person in 1999 is, of course, the first step in her overall case that her career, which in 1999 she says was one producing rich financial rewards, was thereafter blighted by the husband during their relationship. It is therefore connected to the issue of 'compensation.' \" On her stature as \"business partner\": . \"In my judgment the picture painted by the husband of the wife's part in his emotional and professional life is much closer to reality than the wife's account. The wife, as the husband said, enjoys being the center of attention. ... I am prepared to accept that her presence was emotionally supportive to him but to suggest that in some way she was his 'business partner' is, I am sorry to have to say, make-belief.\" On gifts to Mills from McCartney: . \"[McCartney] asserted (and there is no dispute) that he made substantial capital payments to the wife over and above an annual allowance of \u00a3360,000 ($720,000) per annum. He lent her monies in respect of his purchase and renovation of [the house] Angel's Rest. In 2002 and 2003 he gave her cash totaling \u00a3500,000 ($1 million). He lent [Heather's sister] Fiona Mills \u00a3421,000 ($842,000) to buy a property and purchased a house for [Heather's relative] Sonya Mills for \u00a3193,000 ($386,000). In 2005 he purchased jewelry for the wife worth \u00a3264,000 ($528,000).\" On some paintings in Angel's Rest: . \"[Mills] asserted in her cross-examination of the husband that some 30 paintings done by [McCartney], which are hanging in Angel's Rest, were given to her by the husband. The husband strongly disagreed. The husband told me that when the wife bought Angel's Rest she had nothing to hang on the walls and so he lent her 30 of his own paintings. He told me they were his, that he may leave them in trust for Beatrice and his other children, and that he wants them back save for the flower photographs and the Isle of Man stamp design, both given to the wife by the husband. The husband, I find, was generous towards the wife but his generosity did not extend to giving her 30 valuable paintings (of his own creation.) I accept the husband's evidence. In my judgment he is entitled to have them back.\" On the size of McCartney's fortune: . \"It is unnecessary in the instant case to arrive at a precise figure for the total wealth of the husband, given its enormous size. As he has always accepted, he can pay any sum which the court considers appropriate as for financial provision for the wife. Nevertheless I find that the husband's total wealth amounts to approximately \u00a3400 million ($800 million). I reject the wife's case that he is worth \u00a3800 million ($1.6 billion). There is absolutely no evidence at all to support that figure or any figure anywhere near it.\" On living style: . \"In my judgment the wife's attitude, ... her open offers, her oral and written evidence, and her submissions is that she is entitled for the indefinite future, if not for the whole of her life, to live at the same 'rate' as the husband and to be kept in the style to which she perceives she was accustomed during the marriage. Although she strongly denied it her case boils down to the syndrome of 'me, too' or 'if he has it, I want it too.' ... It must have been absolutely plain to the wife after separation that it was wholly unrealistic to expect to go on living at the rate at which she perceived she was living.\" On Mills' future: . \"The wife's case is that her earning capacity is now zero. The wife, as I have said, blames the husband for his attitude towards her working during the marriage. That I have found to be a false case. ... The wife would say she is at a severe disadvantage. I think she overplays her hand. ... I have no doubt that, despite the very adverse publicity in the last 2 years or a little under, the wife does have an earning capacity. She has earned her living since the age of 17. I have found that her association with the husband advanced, not stultified, her career.\" E-mail to a friend .", "f12e4bbb07211de7d43b4e331dc73404aa804562": "(Mental Floss) -- There have been presidential daughters almost as long as there have been presidents. (George Washington had no children.) President Warren Harding made child-care payments to his mistress for years until his death in 1923. What these women did -- both under the influence of and independent from their influential fathers -- make fascinating stories. Here are five you might not have heard: . 1. Sarah Knox Taylor Davis . She packed a lot of drama into her 21 years. The second daughter of future U.S. President Zachary Taylor, Sarah also was the first wife of future Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Her parents gave her the middle name Knox after Fort Knox, in pre-state Indiana, where her military father was stationed and where she was born in 1813 or 1814. Sarah was often called Knox or Knoxie. The life of an army brat was certainly more dangerous in the early 19th century. During Taylor's posting in Louisiana, Sarah and her two sisters came down with \"bilious fever,\" now thought to be malaria. Sarah survived, but her older and younger sisters died. The Taylors were stationed at Fort Crawford (now Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin) in 1832, when Sarah met and fell in love with a young officer named Jefferson Davis. Zachary Taylor opposed the relationship, and accounts vary as to why --because he didn't want his daughter to continue to be exposed to the hardships of army life, or because he and Davis didn't get along. Or both. Davis was transferred, so he and Sarah conducted a long-distance relationship for two years. They even planned their wedding by mail. The ceremony took place in June 1835, in Louisville, Kentucky. Sarah's parents did not attend. Once again there is disagreement over why they were absent. The newlyweds immediately headed south, and they visited Davis's relatives in Louisiana. Sarah, mindful of the family tragedy the last time the Taylors traveled those parts, wrote home, \"Do not make yourself uneasy about me, the country is quite healthy.\" But while staying with Davis's oldest sister at \"Locust Grove\" in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana, the couple fell ill with malaria. Jefferson Davis recovered, but Sarah died, barely three months into her marriage. Mental Floss: 5 memorable White House weddings . 2. Elizabeth Harrison Walker . Her life straddled the Gilded Age of her father, President Benjamin Harrison, and the Television Age, when accomplished women were just beginning to enter in numbers into the mainstream of public life. Elizabeth was born in 1897, four years after her father left office. A widower with two children by his first wife, Harrison had married Mary Scott Lord Dimmick, and Elizabeth was the couple's only child. She was just 4 when her father, the last of the bearded presidents, passed away. If Elizabeth's dynastic 1921 marriage to James Blaine Walker -- grandnephew of her father's secretary of state and onetime Republican presidential nominee James G. Blaine -- was conventional, much of the rest of her life was not. By the time of her wedding, she had received several academic degrees, including a law degree from New York University Law School, and was admitted to the bar in New York and Indiana at age 22. After her marriage, she began publishing a monthly newsletter, \"Cues on the News.\" Geared toward women, it offered economic and investment tips, and was distributed nationally by banks. Her expertise led to appearances on radio and, later, television, where she spoke on economic issues pertaining to women. She died in 1955, at the age of 58. Mental Floss: Quiz: Post--White House lives of presidents . 3. Margaret Woodrow Wilson . Thirty years before the Beatles went to India to sample and popularize its spiritual wonders, another musician and political activist, Margaret Woodrow Wilson, had already been. It was the final chapter in the peripatetic life of the eldest of President Woodrow Wilson's three daughters. Margaret was born in 1886, in Gainesville, Georgia. During her father's presidency, both of Margaret's sisters had White House weddings. So when their mother died in 1914, it fell to the unmarried eldest Wilson sister to become White House hostess. The president's remarriage a year later allowed Margaret to pursue her passion -- music. She studied piano and voice at the Peabody Institute of Music in Baltimore. In 1915, she made her singing debut with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, in Syracuse, New York. During World War I, she gave recitals that benefited the Red Cross and performed at Army camps. In 1918, she began nearly a year's stay in France, singing before Allied troops. The experience led to a breakdown, the loss of her singing voice, and the end of her musical career. Mental Floss: Why do we sing the National Anthem at sporting events? With the war over and women gaining the right to vote, Margaret became an advocate of a style of local participatory democracy in which neighborhood schools would become community centers. The annual $2,500 stipend bequeathed by her father upon his death in 1924 was not enough for her live on, so Margaret entered the advertising business. A speculation in oil stocks went sour, and as the 1920s ended, she ceased being a public figure. In the 1930s she discovered the writings of Sri Aurobindo, a contemporary of Mahatma Gandhi's, whose philosophy for ending foreign rule in India was grounded in yoga and meditation. Eventually she followed her guru east. When a New York Times reporter found Margaret in Aurobindo's ashram in Pondicherry, India, in 1943, she had been living there four years. At the ashram she was known as Dishta. She died there in 1944 at the age of 57 of uremic poisoning. 4. Elizabeth Ann Christian Blaesing . Probably the only advantage to being the child of one of America's worst presidents was not having his last name. Warren G. Harding had no children with his wife, but a married man with two mistresses is bound to leave a legacy. Elizabeth Ann was the daughter of Nan Britton, who as a teenager began a six-year affair with Harding, which lasted until his death in 1923. Elizabeth Ann was conceived on a couch in Harding's Senate office and was born in 1919. On the birth certificate, Britton wrote Christian as the baby's last name. Until his inauguration in 1921, Harding made child-care payments to Britton in person, but always refused to meet Elizabeth Ann. After he entered the White House, Secret Service agents delivered the payments. But when Harding died, the money stopped. In 1927, after Harding's widow refused to continue child support, Britton published The President's Daughter. The tell-all book became a bestseller. As the years passed, the story of Nan Britton and the president's \"love child\" faded, along with memories of Harding's inept presidency. As an infant, Elizabeth Ann was adopted by Britton's sister and brother-in-law for the sake of appearances. As an adult, she married Henry Blaesing. They lived quietly in Glendale, California, and raised three sons. Elizabeth Ann gave one of her first interviews, to The New York Times, in 1964. In it she revealed that her mother was living secretly nearby. Nan Britton died in 1991, \"evidently so forgotten by history that no obituary was published,\" the Los Angeles Times later wrote. Elizabeth Ann died in 2005. 5. Margaret Truman Daniel . The helicopter parent is nothing new. But that pesky parental hovering can whip up a lot of dust when Dad is straight-talking President Harry S Truman. Born in 1924, Margaret was Harry and Bess Truman's only child. Like Margaret Wilson, she began her career as a singer. She was studying history and international relations at George Washington University when her father became vice president in January 1945. Less than three months later, Franklin Roosevelt died and Harry Truman became the 33rd president. After intensive musical training, Margaret made her singing debut in 1947 with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra on a nationally broadcast radio program. She began touring the country, appeared on radio and television, and signed a recording contract. Then came her infamous 1950 concert in Washington, D.C.'s Constitution Hall, in which her father played a role perhaps larger than hers. \"Paul Hume, the music critic of The Washington Post, while praising her personality, said that 'she cannot sing very well,' added that 'she is flat a good deal of the time' and concluded that she had no 'professional finish,' \" The New York Times recalled at the time of Margaret's death last January. \"Incensed, President Truman dispatched a combative note to Mr. Hume, who released it to the press... It said, in part, 'I have just read your lousy review . . . I have never met you, but if I do, you'll need a new nose.'\" (Read the review and President Truman's response here.) The episode didn't seem to impact her career, but her professional singing days were numbered anyway. Margaret would become a radio and television personality, co-hosting the 1950s radio program, \"Weekday,\" with Mike Wallace. She acted in summer stock. And in 1956 she married New York Times editor Clifton Daniel, with whom she had three sons. But Margaret still had other media to conquer. She became a prolific author, writing several non-fiction books, including biographies of her parents. And she penned 13 mystery novels, beginning with \"Murder in the White House.\" For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com . Entire contents of this article copyright, Mental Floss LLC.
