We will try to give them a hard time.\"\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\nThe 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\n\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\"\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\", adding: \"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\"\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\nTodt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\n\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\nBahrain GP qualifying results\nBahrain GP coverage details",

    "34944735": "That is the conclusion of a study by US biologists, exploring how the colour is created in different tarantula species.\nThe hue is caused by tiny structures inside the animals' hairs, but those shapes vary across the family tree.\nThis suggests, the researchers say, that the striking blue is not driven by sexual selection - unlike many other bright colours in the animal kingdom.\nThis argument is also supported by the fact that tarantulas have poor colour vision, and do not appear to show off their hairy blue body parts during courtship.\nNonetheless, Bor-Kai Hsiung and his colleagues found that 40 out of 53 groupings (genera) of tarantula exhibit a very vibrant blue.\n\"We collected published data and constructed a super-tree, which combined the previous published small trees,\" said Mr Hsiung, a PhD student at the University of Akron in Ohio and the first author of the study, published in Science Advances.\nThey then mapped blueness onto that evolutionary tree, based on a bank of tarantula snaps scoured from the internet.\n\"If the genus has at least one species that's blue, we say that's a blue genus,\" Mr Hsiung explained.\nGiven that scattering of blue species, he added, they then calculated \"the lowest number of changes that can produce a distribution of blue colouring like this\".\nThe answer? \"Eight is the lowest number, so it's [evolved] at least eight times.\"\nWhat is more, all these blue spiders evolved almost precisely the same shade; the wavelengths the team saw in the images all fell within a tight 20 nanometre range, clustered around 450nm - a bright, cobalt blue.\nThe team also purchased specimens of eight tarantula species, and took a close look at those blue hairs.\nThey used electron microscopes to zoom in on tiny shapes within the hairs and conducted simulations of how those shapes could produce a \"structural colour\" by reflecting - very specifically - this wavelength of blue light.\nThe results, again, pointed to the colour cropping up multiple times independently: several different types of shape could be seen, even on the same branch of the family tree.\n\"That's one of the reasons why it must have evolved so many times - because we don't see a very clear pattern of how these different mechanisms split,\" Mr Hsiung said.\n\"If we could see a clear split, then it might have evolved just one or two times. But it's all over the place.\"\nSo why did all these different species acquire the same colour?\nGiven their relatively simple eyes, it is doubtful that tarantulas can distinguish this shade of blue from any other colour.\nThat is one of the reasons that sexual selection seems unlikely - by contrast with some other spiders, which have remarkably good vision and put on very colourful courtship displays, such as the mesmerising peacock spider.\n\"It evolved from multiple origins and different mechanisms produce the very same blue colour,\" Mr Hsiung said. \"That's very strong evidence to suggest that this blue colour has a very important visual signalling function.\n\"But if it's not for other tarantulas, then it must be to some other receivers out there.\"\nIt may be that this colour helps conceal the critters from their prey while they hunt at night; or perhaps it serves as a warning to stop the tarantulas themselves being eaten.\n\"We don't know yet,\" Mr Hsiung said.\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter",

He is currently not hosting the show.\nGiving evidence on Wednesday, Mr Fox said he had worked with \"hundreds\" of female colleagues during his career, but had never been accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour until last year.\nUnder questioning from his defence counsel, Jonathan Caplan QC, he told the court his teams had kept their energy up during live broadcasts by playing loud music, dancing and creating makeshift obstacle courses.\n\"It sounds daft, but it was the way we, I, got myself going, and the team would join in very much as well. They would be part of that.\"\nHe said his entire shifts, not just the on-air periods, constituted a \"full performance\" and colleagues would often make playful comments to one another.\nMr Caplan asked: \"Could those comments become edgy or sexual?\"\nMr Fox replied: \"Of course they could. Like any office. Some of it could be saucy, cheeky, over-the-top.\"\nReferring to the \"horseplay\" in the office, Mr Fox insisted he would never have engaged in such conduct if it was not consensual, \"otherwise it would create a bad atmosphere in the studio\".\nAsked whether the culture of radio had changed during the past 25 years, he said: \"I think the workplace in general, it's changed, hasn't it?\n\"Laws have changed. HR has changed. Political correctness has changed.\"\nHe added: \"But I don't think my behaviour has changed.

Asked about that, he said: \"That would be wholly wrong, totally disrespectful, and it's not something I would do.\"\nThe complainant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has also said Mr Fox once pushed her over and simulated having sex with her.\nAddressing that allegation, he said people in his then-workplace often pretended to have been caught in compromising positions - it was a \"play-acting high jinks thing\", he said.\nMr Fox told the court he had seen it \"many times\", but agreed that out of context, the \"Benny Hill-style\" comedy could have seemed inappropriate.\nProsecutor John Price QC said: \"She says that when you did that to her, she did not consent to it. Are you in a position to dispute that?\"\nMr Fox replied: \"I can't get in (her) head.\"\nMr Price continued: \"Did you ask her before you did it if it was okay?\" to which the defendant replied: \"No.\"\nMr Fox also denied having sexual contact with a 15-year-old fan, including during a private tour of Capital Radio's record library.\n\"It never happened,\" he said, although he did acknowledge he \"could have easily taken her for a tour\".\nMr Fox agreed it would be \"quite wrong\" for an adult man to \"stick his tongue\" into the mouth of a teenage girl, as the woman alleged he had done in the station's car park on another occasion.\nIf a young fan asked him for a kiss, he would respond with \"a social kiss\" on the cheek, he said.\nThe girl in question had, he added, \"become a little bit obsessed with me\".\nAsked why three unrelated individuals were accusing him of similar inappropriate conduct, Mr Fox replied: \"I don't have an explanation at all.\"\nMr Price said: \"Coincidence is ridiculous, isn't it, as an explanation for these things?\"\nThe DJ replied: \"I can't explain those coincidences.\"\nThe trial continues.",

She had been raped by the same man.\nWhen she reported the crime to elders, Wendy was made to describe it in minute detail to a group of older men.\nLater, she had to give her account again in the same room as Sewell.\nAfterwards, the elders told her that as it was only her account against that of Sewell, nothing more could be done.\nThis bringing together of the accused and the accuser in a \"judicial committee\" is a common feature of Jehovah's Witnesses' justice.\nKaren, still a teenager at the time, was put through the process.\nThe elders also ruled that their separate accusations didn't constitute the required two witnesses.\nDespite a pattern of predatory sexual behaviour, it took more than two decades to bring Wendy and Karen's abuser to justice.\nHe is now serving a 14-year prison sentence.\nHis punishment from the Jehovah's Witnesses? There wasn't one.\nEven when the case came to court, the organisation was reluctant to co-operate.\nKaren's father, John Viney, who was also an elder in the Barry congregation, says that elders who knew of Sewell's conduct and were asked to give statements or evidence in court did not want to get involved.\nIn a programme for Radio 4's The Report, we have identified this lack of co-operation in several other similar cases.\nConfidential documents from the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Britain - the official name for the Jehovah's Witnesses - that we have seen are explicit about the best way to deal with such matters being within the congregation.\nNowhere in the hundreds of pages we have seen are elders told that they must go to the police, even if the perpetrator confesses, unless state or national law makes it mandatory to report such allegations.\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses' UK leadership declined to talk to us for the programme.\nIn a statement, they said they were appealing against a recent High Court ruling in the UK that awarded substantial damages against the organisation for failing to protect a child from sexual abuse by a paedophile.\nTheir statement also insists that the organisation does take child abuse extremely seriously.\nKaren Morgan and Wendy are now pursuing a civil claim against the organisation, hoping that further financial penalty may force the leadership of the Jehovah's Witnesses to change its policies.\nFor both of them, what made it even harder was the sense that belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses was part of an all-encompassing lifestyle, with members encouraged to socialise and marry within the group.\nThe organisation has some eight million members around the world, but as Karen found to her cost, those who decide to have a boyfriend or girlfriend who is not a member may find themselves \"disfellowshipped\" or shunned.\nJehovah's Witnesses are not the only religious organisation to try to deal with allegations of sexual abuse in-house.\nFor many decades, that was the preferred method of the Roman Catholic Church, which has since reformed its child safeguarding policies following numerous court cases in the US and Europe against priests for the sexual abuse of children.\nOther churches have also tightened up their child safeguarding policies, with the Methodist Church conducting its own recent inquiry into abuse allegations dating back to 1950.\nThat inquiry has led to calls for the Church of England to hold a fresh internal inquiry of its own, separately from the overarching national public inquiry that has just begun, and from the investigation it published in 2010, which critics termed inadequate.\nHowever, it is the more closed religious communities and new religious movements where it remains hardest for the victims of such abuse to speak out and gain access to secular justice, although awareness of the issue is growing.\nOnly this month, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish scholar from Manchester - who fled to Israel after he was exposed as a paedophile - was jailed for 13 years.\nTodros Grynhaus was deported by the Israeli authorities to face justice in the UK, with his conviction for sex offences against girls leading to a change in attitudes in the Haredi Jewish community.\nThe case prompted the UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, to urge members to report child sex abuse.\nThe court had heard that both women who testified against Grynhaus in the case had been \"ostracised\" by their community as a result of speaking out about their ordeal.\nFor young Muslim girls, the price of speaking out about child sexual abuse can also be high, with many reluctant to report such abuse because of the fear that it would bring shame on them and their family.\nSexual and physical abuse at Islamic religious schools, known as madrassas, has also resulted in some prosecutions in recent years, although often victims still hesitate to come forward with such allegations.\nMany religious organisations will find themselves being closely scrutinised in the national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse,  chaired by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard.\nThe survivors of such abuse hope that the inquiry will prove itself truly independent, and help ensure that abusers will not be able to rely on their own congregations or religious leaders to protect them - whatever their faith.\nThe Inquiry will investigate a wide range of institutions including:\nLocal authorities\nThe police\nThe Crown Prosecution Service\nThe Immigration Service\nThe BBC\nThe armed forces\nSchools\nHospitals\nChildren's homes\nChurches, mosques and other religious organisations\nCharities and voluntary organisations\nFull details of the inquiry\nCaroline Wyatt's investigation will be broadcast in Radio 4's The Report at 20:00 BST on Thursday, 23 July.",

A little more charm, and a lot less cheap rhetoric, would do much to protect the UK's interests.\"\nHe also said the \"cheerleaders\" for Brexit had shown a \"disregard that amounts to contempt\" towards those that backed the losing side.\nAnd he said the UK would become \"far more dependent\" on the US after it leaves the EU, describing President Donald Trump as \"less predictable, less reliable and less attuned to our free market and socially liberal instincts than any of his predecessors\".\nSir John, who as prime minister between 1990 and 1997 oversaw the start of the Northern Ireland peace process, warned that \"uncertainties over border restrictions\" after Brexit were \"a serious threat to the UK, to the peace process and for Ireland, North and South\".\nThe ex-PM, who faced battles with Eurosceptic MPs during his time in Downing Street, also said Mrs May would have to \"face down\" people calling for \"total disengagement\" from Europe.\nBut the Leave Means Leave campaign hit back, recalling Sir John's famous \"don't bind my hands\" plea to Tory Eurosceptics ahead of EU talks and saying he was now \"seeking to do just this to the British prime minister ahead of negotiations with the EU\".\nConservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg added: \"It was a craven and defeated speech of a bitter man who was heavily defeated by the electorate for his own failings in Europe in 1997, was defeated again last June and now wishes to take out his failures on Mrs May.\"",

The Commons vote is due at 19:00 GMT.\nThe House of Commons is debating the Welfare Benefits Uprating Bill, which would keep benefit rises to 1% for three years from next April.\nThe coalition argues this is necessary to reduce the deficit, and is fair at a time when public sector pay is being capped and salaries in the private sector are rising below the rate of inflation.\nBut Labour, which opposes the cap, says it will result in a real-terms cut in support for millions of working people.\nSome Lib Dem MPs, including David Ward, John Leech, Julian Huppert and former minister Sarah Teather, are expected to rebel against the government while others - including Julian Huppert - could abstain.\nMr Leech, MP for Manchester Withington, said he found it \"objectionable that the Tories are using 'skivers versus strivers' rhetoric to justify a cut to seven million working families\".\nDespite the concerns of some Lib Dems, the coalition is thought likely to win the vote.\nLegislation is needed to implement changes announced by Chancellor George Osborne in last month's Autumn Statement - to cap increases in jobseeker's allowance, employment and support allowance, income support and elements of housing benefit.\nThe cap would also apply to maternity allowance, sick pay, maternity pay and paternity pay as well as the couple and lone parent elements of the working tax credit and the child element of the child tax credit.\nThese benefits traditionally rise in line with consumer prices in an annual process known as \"uprating\".\nBy Ross HawkinsPolitical correspondent, BBC News\nGlance at the spreadsheets and the scale of the saving is apparent.\nFigures in the Autumn Statement show raising many benefits and tax credits by 1% a year will save \u00a32.8bn in 2015/16, compared with the government's previous plans.\nThe overall welfare budget in 2011/12, as calculated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is \u00a3201bn.\nThe political debate will centre on who should feel the pain.\nJobseekers Allowance totals 2.4% of the total bill, according to the IFS. Benefits for those on low incomes make up just under 21%.\nThose for elderly people, including the state pension, make up over 42%.\nThe estimated value of fraud and error overpayments in benefit expenditure in 2011-12 is \u00a33.2 billion.\nThey increased 5.2% this year and without the planned change would have been set to rise by 2.2% - the rate of CPI inflation last September, on which the figure is calculated. The rate of inflation has since risen to 2.7%.\nDuring lively scenes in Parliament, Mr Duncan Smith said: \"The number one priority now is reducing the deficit that they [Labour] left us - the biggest deficit since the Second World War.\"\nHe added that the gap between the rate of income inflation between workers and the unemployed had \"grown\" in the last few years.\n\"These are decisions that we are not taking easily but these are circumstances that they [Labour] are in denial about,\" Mr Duncan Smith said.\nFor Labour, shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne accused the government of presiding over an increase in unemployment.\nBut Mr Duncan Smith said this was not the case and that the US and other European countries were faring worse than the UK.\nMr Byrne said the government was showing \"contempt\" by trying to \"ram this bill through the House in just one day\".\nHe added: \"It's turning into a hit-and-run on working families and we should not stand for it.\"\nGreen Party MP Caroline Lucas said: \"Isn't the truth of this that it's a mean and miserable piece of legislation from a mean and miserable government?\"\nSarah Teather, who was replaced as an education minister in last autumn's government reshuffle, said she would oppose the bill \"with a heavy heart\" because it was \"disingenuous\" to try to \"find someone to blame for our own woes\".\n\"A fissure already exists between the working and non-working poor,\" she told MPs. \"Hammering on that fault line with the language of 'shirkers and strivers' will have long-term impacts on public attitudes, on attitudes of one neighbour against another.\n\"It will make society less generous, less sympathetic, less able to co-operate.\"\nHowever, Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes told the House: \"It's difficult but the government has got the right and I believe, after this parliament, it will be vindicated by getting more people in work and fewer out of work.\"\nDavid Cameron's official spokesman said: \"The prime minister's view is that the welfare system has to be brought back under control. The measures that the government has been taking, ever since the government came to power, have been designed to that end.\"\nThe BBC's political correspondent Gary O'Donoghue said an \"impact assessment\" published by the government suggested single parents would be most affected by the cap - losing \u00a35 a week or about \u00a3250 over the three year period.\nThe majority of working age households in receipt of state support are likely be an average of \u00a33 a week worse off.",

    "14958201": "Everton had won on their last four visits to City - and for an hour frustration was in the air again as they mounted a wall of well-organised resistance that kept Roberto Mancini's side at bay.\nThe introduction of substitute Mario Balotelli on the hour led to the breakthrough as he scored with a deflected shot after 68 minutes and finally unsettled Everton with an impressive cameo.\nIt was the type of result and performances that adds weight to the argument that City will mount a serious title challenge this season\nRead more of the blog\nJames Milner, another second-half substitute, added the second with two minutes left from David Silva's sublime pass to allow City to move top of the Premier League ahead of Manchester United's visit to Stoke City.\nAnd it was a win City deserved for demonstrating the patience and persistence they will need as Everton's dour approach is likely to be mirrored by plenty of sides who will attempt to suppress City's wide range of attacking options at Etihad Stadium.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nEverton's tactics appeared designed to secure a draw and perhaps aim to take an isolated chance on the break.\nBut David Moyes' side were undermined by a failure to offer anything in attack, although substitute Louis Saha - and his manager - were rightly infuriated when referee Howard Webb failed to award a free-kick when he was blatantly fouled on the edge of the area by Vincent Kompany with the game still in the balance.\nMoyes also believed Everton had been the victims of injustice in the build-up to Balotelli's crucial goal, claiming City were wrongly awarded a throw in.\nMancini will relish the manner of this win as much as other victories earned in real style this season. Everton offered a stern test and City showed growing maturity to get the three points.\nEverton's superbly drilled defensive formation offered nothing other than frustration to City in the first half as they stood firm.\nMoyes had clearly earmarked Silva as central to City's threat and he deployed youngster Jack Rodwell to man-mark the Spaniard. And when he received a yellow card for a foul on Silva responsibility briefly switched to Phil Neville, until he drew similar punishment from referee Webb after a clash with Silva.\nSergio Aguero was City's main threat in the early exchanges, but it was the 53rd minute before Everton posed a serious threat as Tim Cahill's header from Seamus Coleman's cross floated over the bar.\nIt was only when Balotelli came on for Edin Dzeko on the hour that City made serious inroads into the Everton defence. Samir Nasri had a shot well saved by Tim Howard before the Italian broke the deadlock seven minutes after his introduction.\nBalotelli's finish from the edge of the area was measured and also took a decisive touch off Everton defender Phil Jagielka to send the ball tantalisingly out of Howard's reach into the bottom corner.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe visitors now needed to shift the entire emphasis of their approach, but City were playing with renewed confidence and Silva hit the woodwork with Howard beaten.\nBalotelli was then narrowly off target before setting up Silva for a tap-in, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside.\nSilva was at his creative best as City wrapped up the win with one minute left. Everton substitute Royston Drenthe lost possession in midfield and Silva threaded through a perfect invitation for Milner to slide his finish past Howard.\nEverton had offered next to nothing in terms of attacking threat, although another City substitute Stefan Savic made a timely intervention in injury time to clear Marouane Fellaini's shot off the line.\nLive text commentary",
    "34352262": "Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs a target to reduce six week delays in discharging patients had been delivered.\nBut Labour said it had not been met for more than three years, and called for her to amend the record.\nMs Sturgeon's office said she would not be revising her remarks because the six-week target had been met in the past.\nDelayed discharge - sometimes referred to as bed blocking - is when a patient is not released from hospital despite being clinically well enough to be discharged, often because of a lack of care of care services.\nMs Sturgeon faced criticism over the issue during first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament, with Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale saying that people had remained in hospital for a total of 612,000 days last year when they were well enough to go home.\nShe said Ms Sturgeon had told the SNP conference in 2011 that patients spent 200,000 days in a hospital bed when they did not need to.\nMs Dugdale added: \"That means it has more than trebled under the SNP government since this first minister admitted there was something badly wrong. So, by any measure that is unacceptable.\n\"That is thousands of patients, the majority of whom are elderly, ready to go back home or into the community but can't because the extra support they need just isn't there.\"\nShe also claimed that delayed discharge got worse during the peak of summer despite Health Secretary Shona Robison saying in February that she wanted to \"completely eradicate\" the problem.\nThe substance is this. In the middle of a flood of stats, Ms Sturgeon said: \"Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we have progressively toughened that target.\"\nA delay of that duration, for the avoidance of doubt, involves a patient being kept in hospital for at least six weeks longer than clinically necessary, generally because no alternative care is available.\nDr Simpson said he had checked with parliament's own information centre. Based on that research, allied to his own knowledge, he believed the First Minister's remarks were misleading.\nAccording to Labour, Scotland's patients had not enjoyed \"zero delays over six weeks\" for three years. That is, there had been patients during that three-year period who had stayed more than six weeks in hospital beyond potential discharge.\nThe immediate response from the First Minister's office is that the target - of zero delays over six weeks - had been met in the past. The general tenor of her remarks was that matters were improving - while there remained more to be done.\nDr Simpson has now, in effect, suggested that Ms Sturgeon might reconsider that stance.\nRead more from Brian\nMs Sturgeon responded by acknowledging that there was still work to do, but said \"real progress\" was being made.\nShe later added: \"Since 2007 there's been a 52% reduction in delays over four weeks, a 55% reduction in delays over six weeks, the number of delays over three days is down by 50%, the number of delays over four weeks has been reduced as well.\n\"Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we've progressively toughened that target and we're now focusing on ensuring patients are discharged within 72 hours.\"\nThat comment drew an angry response from Labour MSP Dr Richard Simpson, who subsequently made a formal point of order to the presiding officer.\nDr Simpson said that the six-week target had been missed in every month since 2012.\nHe also said that official statistics showed that more than 4,700 patients had been delayed more than six weeks despite being fit to leave since 2012, and nearly 400 in the past two months alone.\nDr Simpson added: \"We all know that nationalist rhetoric is divorced from reality but this is completely unacceptable.  It was completely wrong to claim that these targets had been met when in reality thousands of patients had waited in hospital beds.\n\"Our NHS is in real trouble. The health minister pledged to abolish delayed discharge by the end of the year. Instead it is going in the wrong direction. Meanwhile we see the first minister is making completely false claims about her government's record.\n\"Patients and staff don't benefit from bogus claims about NHS performance. The first minister should correct the record, and this SNP government should get a grip of delayed discharge rather than bury their heads in the sand.\"\nBut a Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"The first minister was correct that the old six week target was met, on a number of occasions, under this government.\n\"Subsequently, the Scottish government introduced new tougher targets that no patient should wait more than four weeks, and later two weeks, from when they are clinically ready for discharge.\n\"Working with our partners in local government we've made the level of performance we expect tougher still, with an ambition for patients to be delayed for no more than 72 hours.\"",

    "34541803": "If he does become the next Premier League manager to lose his job, it would not just be unfair, it would be absolutely ridiculous.\nI cleaned Tim's boots when I was an apprentice at Norwich in the late 1980s, and he was the captain at Blackburn Rovers when we won the Premier League together in 1995.\nOf course I am not just backing him to succeed at Villa because I used to play with him - the reason is that, since the earliest days of my career, I have always seen him as manager material.\nWhen I was a teenager I looked up to him because I liked the way he went about things and how he dealt with me and other people. Even though he was a young man then too, the other players all thought the same.\nCharacter is a bit of a buzzword these days, but as a player I looked around for team-mates who had the ability to handle pressure and Tim was always one of them.\nAt 46, he is a relatively young manager now, certainly in terms of experience, but you have to remember he was quite a young captain at Blackburn too - he was 26 when we were champions.\nWe had some pretty big-hitters in terms of personalities in that dressing room, the likes of Alan Shearer, David Batty, Tim Flowers and Colin Hendry.\nThey were never afraid to have their say but, if you speak to them, they will all tell you they admired Tim not just for what he brought to the team as a player but also his contribution to the club's success as captain.\nFor Tim to be skipper ahead of, say, Shearer shows you what the Blackburn boss Kenny Dalglish thought of him too.\nHe always had the leadership qualities you need as a manager and, on top of that, I always thought he was extremely knowledgeable about the game.\nHe comes across as confident or even cocky in some respects, but in the dressing room it doesn't matter whether you are an introvert or an extrovert as long as what you are saying makes sense. Tim always did.\nSo it does not surprise me that, as a manager, he has got the best out of players who had been under-performing - like Emmanuel Adebayor at Spurs or Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Villa last season - because he has always had the ability to get people playing for him.\nAt times he might say things that players don't like - because he tells the truth. That ruffles a few feathers but I don't mind it, in fact he should be commended for it.\nThese days I hear a lot of people in football say things with no substance behind them, but Tim certainly is not like that - he can always back his opinions up.\nTim earned his right to have a proper crack at being Villa boss with the incredible job he did to keep them up after taking charge in February, when they were in desperate trouble with a dreadful scoring record.\nVilla have been fighting relegation for a few years now under several different managers so this season was never going to be any different.\nBut, just eight games into the new campaign and at the first sign of adversity, Sherwood already appears to be under massive pressure.\nYou have to take into consideration that he lost his two best players over the summer in striker Benteke and midfielder Delph, who were both inspirational for him last season, and realise he is trying to build a new team with all the signings that Villa have made.\nVilla's net spend over the summer was under \u00a310m - and a lot of that went on young players with little or no Premier League experience.\nThey have plenty of potential, and also plenty of sell-on value which seems to be a big part of the club's thinking, but it is a gamble whether they work out for Villa now and that is Sherwood's problem.\nI don't know who had the final say on each deal but from what I understand, Villa's head of recruitment Paddy Reilly and sporting director Hendrik Almstadt play a big part in the process.\nYou cannot blame Tim for the squad not being strong enough if it is not just down to him, but he is the one who is being criticised because Villa have not won since the opening day.\nI get why the club's owner Randy Lerner might be getting twitchy because of the amount of money at stake if they go down, but the logical thing to do is to give Sherwood more time because he is an intelligent man who has already shown he can improve players - which is exactly what Villa need now.\nSherwood has chopped and changed his team and formation a lot so far, but that is only because he is trying to find the right balance between attack and defence while he beds those new signings in and finds a system that works with the players he has got.\nThe choices he has to make with his current forwards is an example of how difficult that is.\nLike Benteke, Rudy Gestede has tremendous physical attributes and is as good as there is in the air in the Premier League.\nIn an effort to make the most of that, Sherwood has tried to get his full-backs forward to get crosses into the box - Jordan Amavi and Alan Hutton or Leandro Bacuna have all done that far more than any of Villa's midfielders.\nBut what Gestede doesn't have is the ability to link up play, or the pace to get behind defences. In that way, Benteke was much more of an all-round striker.\nSherwood can leave out Gestede and play Gabriel Agbonlahor or Jordan Ayew if he wants pace, but then he does not have that same physical presence up front, or any aerial threat.\nWhoever he picks, he is missing something that Benteke provided on his own.\nBecause he is trying to find that balance between attack and defence, he cannot always play two up front to solve that problem, especially because he is also trying to fit Jack Grealish into his team as an attacking midfielder.\nGrealish is a young player who has a lot of talent but picking him creates a different issue because winning games is not just down to what happens when you have got the ball.\nHowever good Grealish is going forward, he does not always put in a shift going back the other way.\nWhen you lose possession, you need to be compact and tight defensively and Villa have lacked that in the games I have seen, notably in their defeat by Leicester when they were hit on the counter-attack time and time again.\nYou really need defensive responsibility when you are in Villa's position near the bottom of the table.\nThat might be one of the reasons why Sherwood has apparently used this international break to try to get Grealish fitter.\nAfter trying so many formations and line-ups, maybe we will see Sherwood sticking with just one in the next five or six games.\nA settled system and some continuity is what Villa need at the moment. Tim knows that and, if he is given the chance, I am confident he will get it right.\nChris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

Manchester City are in a top-four fight now.\nForm: Unbeaten in past 12.\nUpcoming fixtures: 21 January - Stoke (away), 1 February - Hull (home), 5 February - Leicester (away).\nManchester United are showing definite signs of improvement under manager Jose Mourinho, but like neighbours City their fight is now for the top four rather than the title.\nThey could have closed to within two points of Liverpool with victory at Old Trafford on Sunday, but 12 points is surely an impossible gap to breach between United and Chelsea.\nUnited have drawn seven league games - including five at home - and the simple fact is they have squandered too many points to make up the deficit.\nMourinho is definitely moving United forward, but not fast enough to make them title contenders this season.\nVerdict: Top four should be the target.

Last year, according to Amnesty International, death sentences were imposed in 63 countries, but only 21 countries actually carried out executions.\nIndia has shied away from executing people for many years now.\nThere have been only two hangings in the country in the past 12 years and the majority of convicts on death row can expect their sentences to be commuted to life. Former president Pratibha Patil commuted the death sentences of 35 convicts midway through her five-year term.\nClemency pleas of 29 prisoners on death row in India are pending before the president. They include Afzal Guru, who was convicted for carrying out an attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001. The Supreme Court upheld his death sentence as long ago as 2004.\nThen there is a serious practical problem: there are only one or two hangmen available in India. Two years ago, I met one in a Calcutta prison who had been employed as a hangman-cum-sweeper, and was still waiting to carry out his first execution.\nRecently, 14 retired Indian judges wrote to the president asking him to commute the death sentences of 13 inmates being held in prisons across the country. And the Supreme Court itself recently admitted that some death penalties it had upheld were erroneous.\n\"Public opinion in India can no longer ignore the global movement in favour of abolition of the death penalty,\" says AP Shah, the former chief justice of the Delhi High Court in an interview in today's The Times of India.\nWhat do you think?",

    "26553115": "They also provide the first direct evidence that there may be as much water trapped in those rocks as there is in all the oceans.\nThe diamond, from central-west Brazil, contains minerals that formed as deep as 600km down and that have significant amounts of water trapped within them.\nResearchers have published their findings in the journal Nature.\nThe study suggests water may be stored deep in the interiors of many rocky planets.\nDiamonds, brought to the Earth's surface in violent eruptions of deep volcanic rocks called kimberlites, provide a tantalising window into the deep Earth.\nA research team led by Prof Graham Pearson of the University of Alberta, Canada, studied a diamond from a 100-million-year-old kimberlite found in Juina, Brazil, as part of a wider project.\nThey noticed that it contained a mineral, ringwoodite, that is only thought to form between 410km and 660km beneath the Earth's surface, showing just how deep some diamonds originate.\nWhile ringwoodite has previously been found in meteorites, this is the first time a terrestrial ringwoodite has been seen. But more extraordinarily, the researchers found that the mineral contains about 1% water.\nWhile this sounds like very little, because ringwoodite makes up almost all of this immense portion of the deep Earth, it adds up to a huge amount of deep water.\nDr Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, commented: \"Finding water in such large concentrations is a hugely significant development in our understanding of the ultimate origin of water now present at Earth's surface.\"\nThe observation is the first physical evidence that water can be stored in the deep interiors of planets and solves a 25-year-old controversy about whether the deep Earth is dry, wet, or wet in patches.\nDiscussing his findings, Prof Pearson told BBC News: \"The discovery highlights the unique value of natural diamonds in trapping and preserving fragments of the deep Earth.\n\"It's incredible to think that, as you hold this sample in your hand, the residual pressure at the interface between the diamond and the inclusion is 20,000 atmospheres.\"\nDescribing his diamond sample, he said: \"It looks like it's been to hell and back, which it has.\"\nProf Joseph Smyth of the University of Colorado has spent many years studying ringwoodite and similar minerals synthesised in his laboratory.\nHe said: \"I think it's stunning! It implies that the interior may store several times the amount of water in the oceans. It tells us that hydrogen is an essential ingredient in the Earth and not added late from comets.\n\"This discovery implies that hydrogen may control the interior processes of the Earth just as it controls the surface processes, and that water planets, like Earth, may be common in our galaxy.\"\nA key question posed by the observation is to understand the extent to which plate tectonics on Earth leads to oceans of water being recycled deep within our planet, and to predict the likely amounts of water trapped in other rocky planets.\nRingwoodite is expected to form deep in Mars as well, for example, where it sits against the metallic core.\nGrains of the same mineral synthesised in Prof Smyth's laboratory shine bright blue under the microscope.\nGiven the new findings of ringwoodite's water-bearing capabilities, its abundance at depth, and its beautiful hue, the term \"blue planet\" seems even more appropriate for Earth.",

    "38735486": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nIt's 1997 and ID7 television are filming at Dunkirk rugby club in northern France. Their subject is in his mid-30s, has a full head of hair and is strangely familiar. He's not French, but he's fluent. Only when the cameraman asks him to say his name does the penny drop.\n\"Je m'appelle Vernon Anthony Cotter.\"\nFor four and a half minutes he doesn't miss a beat - and why would he? Cotter had been in the country for years by then. Four seasons playing in the back row with Rumilly in the south-east, two years with Lourdes in the foothills of the Pyrenees, a year with Saint-Junien in west-central France and he would soon kick on for the small southern village of Castelnau-Riviere-Basse, where he played and coached while briefly contemplating a new life as a winemaker.\nCotter is now sitting in Murrayfield talking about the past, the present, the future. The New Zealander has been Scotland coach for 31 Test matches - 16 victories, 15 defeats, nine of which were by seven points or less, five of them by three or less.\nHe's given a first cap to 26 players. Eighteen of the squad he has just named for the Six Nations have appeared on his watch.\nHe has just five more Tests before France reclaims him. Montpellier await. Time for reflection, then. Time to remember where Cotter came from and where he has taken Scotland in his two and a half eventful years.\nCotter is big into culture. Rugby culture. He learned about it first as a player with Counties in New Zealand but a lot of his knowledge came in those early years in France. \"I used to think I was a reasonably physical player, but I was a baby,\" he says.\nI understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here\n\"I learned a lot about character and defending the jersey. You couldn't help but get swept away. The French flair - I used to laugh at that. It wasn't true. Overlaps were created because two forward packs were generally having a good whack at each other.\"\nHe tells a story about a derby match from the mid-90s, his own Lourdes team versus Pau. No love lost between them. In their previous meeting there'd been \"scuffles\" and Lourdes had come off second best.\n\"Our players were doing cartwheels going on to the paddock,\" Cotter recounts. \"The coach said, 'Right boys, tactics for the day. The first five [eighth] kick it straight into the stand and we run up and punch them.' That's what happened. I had somebody who had given me a gentle tickle in the away game and I managed to line him up.\n\"There was an all-out brawl, but no penalty. We had a scrum in midfield and our locks came through and caressed the opposition front row a little bit with their hands. A couple of them needed treatment and we scored a try from there. It was an insight.\n\"It wasn't just a game. I enjoyed the fact that you were playing for your town and your colours. They could be absolute psychopaths on the paddock and gentlemen afterwards.\"\nYears later, while coaching at Clermont, Cotter was given a nickname - les yeux de glace ('eyes of ice'). Years after that, in Scotland, he was christened Stern Vern. To understand what makes him tick, the period of his life in a country where he's already done 17 years, and where he will soon return for another three, is important.\nEight seasons at Clermont turned Cotter into one of the hottest coaching tickets in world rugby. The season before he took over, the club finished a poor eighth in the French championship. In his first year - and for the three years that followed - they made the final.\nIn 2010 they won the first league title in their history. Cotter - with his great friend Joe Schmidt as assistant coach - had become immortal in the French game.\nClermont were never out of the top four on Cotter's watch. Then, the move to Scotland. Not a lot of people in France could understand why he did it. Going to New Zealand, they would have understood. England, they could get. Ireland, perhaps. But Scotland?\n\"It's something that I didn't have to do, it's something that we wanted to do as a family,\" he explains.\n\"One of the key motivating factors was that people [in France] would take the mickey out of Scotland and its rugby. It sort of upset me. I was defending the underdog.\n\"Before the Six Nations, everybody would take a sweepstake and Scotland was always last pick.\n\"Look, I remember the 1990s. I remember Scotland coming to New Zealand [in the summer of 1990] and they should have beaten the All Blacks. We weren't inventing the game, Scotland were doing it. When we first came together as a squad we looked at some footage of those days. They were brave, confident warriors.\n\"Trying to bring that back to Scotland was one of the key things. They [Jim Telfer and Ian McGeechan, the coaches of the era] were ahead of their time. Any comparison to those two great men is very nice. I would take inspiration from what they did. The game has moved on but some of the essential things they were coaching are still relevant, especially to the Scottish psyche.\n\"Scotland has a proud history. It's a humble country and it's a place you can become attached to very quickly.\"\nIn Cotter's first Six Nations, in 2015, Scotland got whitewashed, Wooden-spooned and, at times, embarrassed. Last season brought progression. The brilliance and pain of the near-miss against Australia in the World Cup, the home win against France in the Six Nations, the fact - incredible as it seems - that 2016 was the first time in the 17-year history of the competition that Scotland managed to score more points than they conceded, and hit double figures for tries scored.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nScotland have become an exciting team. More than at any point since last winning the championship under Telfer in 1999, they're posing a threat to the big nations.\n\"The principal foundations are mindset and skill-set,\" says Cotter. \"It was about creating clarity.\n\"The other thing is leadership, creating a leadership group so that they determine behaviour and standards because it's always much easier when you have a group that can think on its feet, that's autonomous. I think that's where we're getting.\n\"You've got a team that's experienced some good things and some bad things. We've become aware of what we can do. Winning is the most important thing. So how do we win? We go through a painful process of learning how to win.\n\"There's been improvement. Would we have liked quicker improvement? Yeah, we probably would. Would we have liked to nail some of those close games? Yes. But we've used them as benchmarks.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOn the opening day of the Six Nations, Ireland come to Edinburgh. \"We played them at the end of the competition in the last two years and their strength in depth showed through,\" Cotter recalls.\n\"We have more depth now to stay a bit more robust until the end. I'd like to think this game will be closer than those two.\n\"It's a really big challenge for our guys. Joe [Schmidt, Ireland coach] is a really good friend and we'll probably have a beer afterwards. Unfortunately, he's always the one with the smile on his face - and I'd like it to stop. I'd like to get one back on him.\"\nBeyond that, it's a trip to France, then a visit from Wales, then a journey down to England. Scotland have moved forward, but that's no guarantee of victories in the coming weeks.\n\"We know that these teams are very good,\" he insists. \"When they see us on the fixture list they know they're going in as favourites, very confident that they'll beat us. It's our job to try to surprise them somehow, to have something that will take them away from the comfort zone and create errors in their game that we can exploit.\"\nFive more games and then he's away. It's not the way he planned it. It's just the way it is, he says.\nWhen the news broke that this was going to be Cotter's final Six Nations, an audible gasp could have been heard around Scottish rugby. There had been little hint of it, no suggestion his time was coming to an end.\nHe would have preferred to stay on, but Gregor Townsend was ready for an elevation and there was only one way that was going to happen.\nWill he miss it? \"Undoubtedly, but we'll come back on holiday,\" he says. \"You never know, you might find that Glasgow are in Montpellier's pool next year in European rugby.\n\"It was always going to be the deal. The SRU had made it known at the outset that they'd like a Scottish coach in the national position sooner or later and I respect entirely the decision. Would I have liked to continue? Yeah, probably would have, but that's the way it is.\"\nCotter, without doubt, has been good for Scotland but he says Scotland has been good for him, too.\n\"I understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here,\" he explains. \"I recognise it in our rural communities.\n\"I'm not an extroverted person - I'm introverted, I'm quiet - and I love the countryside, I love what Scotland has got to offer, whether it's the coastline, the mountains, the rivers. I enjoyed my time in Colonsay, fishing on the west coast in Plockton, stalking in Glen Shiel.\n\"We've got some good friends in the Borders who love their rugby and it's nice to see their passion. They talk about passion in France, but there's some real passion here for the game.\n\"It's been a privilege, the whole thing. I've only got fond memories. I move on. The game has existed in this country for over a hundred years and it will exist long after I've left. There's another project to move to after I finish here. We were going to go back to New Zealand but then Montpellier came up. They wanted something constructed and the communication I had with the president convinced me that there was perhaps another adventure to take on.\"\nMore than anything he wants to exit on a high. In the coming weeks he says he wants the team to deliver moments that will bond them together not just in the here and now but for decades down the road.\n\"They give everything, these guys,\" he adds. \"They're striving to give people something to be proud of. The stadium is a sell-out for Ireland. So, game on...\"",

One found someone who needed support at home to take medication or monitor a health condition like diabetes would score the same on the benefits criteria as people who needed help with a therapy such as kidney dialysis.\nA second ruling said people who struggled to travel independently because of conditions such as anxiety scored the same as someone who was, for example, blind.\nThe government said the combined effects of the rulings would have added \u00a33.7bn to the benefits bill by 2023.\nThe benefit payments are aimed at helping people cope with the extra costs of living with ill health or disability and are made according to the points a person scores in an assessment of their needs.\nThe replacement of Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which was partly self-assessed, with PIPs, where eligibility is tested by a company, has been controversial.\nEligibility for PIPs is reviewed regularly and the qualifying criteria are also stricter.\nIn a written statement to the House of Commons on Thursday, Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work Penny Mordaunt said the government monitored how effective the payment was in supporting those facing the greatest barriers to leading independent lives.\nShe said that PIPs were designed to give \"non-physical conditions... the same recognition as physical ones\".\nBut she added: \"Now, over two thirds of PIP claimants with mental health conditions get the higher Daily Living award, worth \u00a382.30 per week, compared to 22% under DLA.\"\nShe said amendments to the criteria would \"provide greater clarity\", saying: \"This will not result in any claimants seeing a reduction in the amount of PIP previously awarded by DWP (the Department of Work and Pensions).\"\nBut Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, Debbie Abrahams, said: \"Instead of listening to the court's criticisms of Personal Independence Payment assessments and correcting these injustices, the government has instead decided to undermine the legal basis of the rulings.\"\nIt was an \"unprecedented attempt\" to subvert a tribunal judgement, she said.\nShe said Labour would fight changes to \"strip\" entitlements from more than 160,000 disabled people - describing them as a \"step too far, even for this Tory government\".\nA Lib Dem work and pensions spokeswoman said it was \"utterly outrageous\" the government was using the ruling to \"make matters worse\" for disabled people.\n\"What makes things even worse is that they have sneaked this announcement out under the cover of [Thursday's] by-elections,\" she said.\nCampaigners said the government should instead embrace the tribunal's findings.\nPhilip Connolly from Disability Rights UK said the changes showed \"escalating levels of unfairness\" in the government's approach to a benefit it had created.\nPeople with \"very serious conditions\" including dementia, learning difficulties and diabetes would be hit, he said.\nThis change was one of several benefit cuts disabled people faced, he said.\nCampaigners are due to stage a protest in Westminster on Wednesday about a \u00a329-a-week cut to employment support payments.\nA DWP spokeswoman said the government was \"committed to ensuring our welfare system is a strong safety net for those who need it.\n\"That's why we spend around \u00a350bn a year to support people with disabilities and health conditions.\"",

Passion for the game was in them all.\nSporting Khalsa entered the local Walsall and District Sunday League, then moved into Saturday football, pushing the boundaries of what could be achieved.\nIn 2004 they joined the West Midlands Regional League. Three promotions have taken them to the upper echelons of the Midland League.\nDecisions now, as they always have, are achieved through discussion and consensus, sometimes in the car as they travel to away games.\nSporting Khalsa's architects were Asian. Their official website calls them a semi-professional Asian club.\nBut it has always been open to all, regardless of religion, skin colour and gender.\nThey bought a pitch at Bloxwich Town but when Aspray Arena became available after Willenhall Town went into administration in 2009, the opportunity to relocate to a stadium barely 400 yards from the Sunday league pitches where the Sporting Khalsa concept first emerged was too tempting to reject.\n\"There is a group of 12 who you could say are the core of the club,\" said Grewa.\n\"We were always aware some of us could not play at a good standard. But we just love the game - and we wanted to see how far we could push ourselves.\n\"You still get the odd comment. We were at an away match recently and someone said, 'I thought you lot only played cricket', so that stereotype is still there.\n\"It makes me angry that something like that still happens because it is absolutely not true.\n\"We just love football. It doesn't matter to us if you are black, green or yellow. We welcome anybody.\n\"We have kids teams from under-6s upwards and four ladies teams. We are a community club - and the community is everybody.\"\nThe club have ambitions of climbing higher up the football pyramid, but there is also a conflict about how progress could permanently alter the identity of the club.\n\"We want to get to the National League,\" said Grewa.\n\"Once you go into the Football League, it becomes a business. I don't know whether we want that.\n\"The founders of the club have never fallen out. That only happens if there is money involved. As it is, everyone is treated equally.\n\"Up to the National League, we could still do our jobs and handle it.\"\nAt 15:00 BST on Saturday, the dreaming must stop.\nBy any logic, Sporting Khalsa do not stand a chance of bridging the gap to FC United, akin to a League Two side taking on a Premier League team.\nThey do have an international, central defender Tes Robinson, who plays for St Kitts and Nevis. They also have a forward, Craig Bannister, who has scored nine times in this season's FA Cup.\nSaturday's match is Sporting Khalsa's seventh FA Cup tie of the season, more than Arsenal played in lifting the trophy in 2014-15.\nThe players share lifts to away games. Many still play Sunday football in addition to Saturdays. And it was not known for certain until less than 24 hours before they left for their replay against Spalding last week that their goalkeeper and winger would be able to play because of work commitments.\n\"I am a Manchester United fan,\" said manager Ian Rowe, who was appointed at the start of the 2014-15 season.\n\"I have followed the FC United story from the start. Next to having my kids, this will be one of the proudest moments of my life.\n\"But let's not kid ourselves.

She says some of her MP colleagues are \"dinosaurs\".\nThe alternative version is that Johann Lamont wasn't up to the job - that she failed to counter the SNP, that she failed to modernise the party sufficiently to cope with a new Scotland where people are no longer prepared to back Labour as a duty, that she failed to attract new talent who might freshen up the party's portrait for the electorate in 2016, when Holyrood goes to the polls.\nReacting to news of the resignation, SNP deputy leader Nicola Sturgeon said that Ms Lamont \"carries my personal best wishes\".\nBut she added: \"There is no question that her shock resignation reveals Labour to be in complete meltdown in Scotland.\"\nMs Sturgeon said: \"The scale of the infighting between Scottish Labour and Labour at Westminster is exposed for all to see.\"\nThe timetable for choosing a new leader will be set out soon.\nIn the meantime, deputy leader Anas Sarwar is in charge and an MSP will be chosen to stand in for Ms Lamont at Holyrood.\nWhoever replaces her will become Scottish Labour's seventh leader since the Scottish Parliament was established 15 years ago.\nMs Lamont, a former English teacher who joined the Labour Party as a teenager, has represented the Glasgow Pollok constituency at Holyrood since 1999.\nShe took over as the party's Scottish leader in the aftermath of the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, when Labour suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the SNP.\nIn the weeks after the independence referendum, she said she wanted to lead Labour to victory in the next Holyrood election in 2016 and become first minister.\nLabour leader Ed Miliband said she deserved \"significant credit\" for the successful \"No\" vote in the Scottish referendum campaign.\nHe added: \"She campaigned the length and breadth of Scotland making the case for social justice within the United Kingdom.\n\"She has led the Scottish Labour Party with determination. I know she will continue to serve her constituents.\n\"Having elected a new leader, I believe the party will show the same will and determination it did in the referendum campaign to help us to victory in the general election of 2015 and the Scottish elections of 2016.\"\nFormer prime minister Gordon Brown has constantly been linked to the job, as has fellow MP Jim Murphy, who also played a prominent role in the referendum campaign.\nMr Brown said he was sorry to hear that Ms Lamont had resigned.\nHe added; \"She brought determination, compassion and a down-to-earth approach to the leadership and deserves great credit for taking on the challenge after 2011.\n\"I wish her well in the future.\"\nSenior Labour sources have indicated that both the former Prime minister, Gordon Brown and the former Scottish Secretary , Jim Murphy, will be approached to see if they are willing to lead the Labour Party in Scotland.\nIf the two men refuse another scenario being canvassed is for a joint ticket between the MP Anas Sarwar and the MSP Kezia Dugdale.\nMr Sarwar would be the leader and would seek to improve relations between Westminster and Holyrood. Ms Dugdale  would lead the group at Holyrood. One Labour source described this as the \"ideal option\".\nOthers believe Mr Murphy should be encouraged to stand. One figure said that if \"Jim doesn't stand it will be a disaster\", but added he believed the shadow cabinet member could be persuaded.",

One was threatened with having his kidney removed by money lenders back home if he didn't pay his debt.\nArefin's crimes were  described as a \"clear case of modern day slavery\".\nAt Fort William Sheriff Court, he was found guilty of breaches of the Asylum and Immigration Act.\nHe carried out the crimes between 2008 and 2010. He recruited his victims by offering them jobs as chefs at his hotel.\nThey were told to pay him substantial sums of money which he described as a \"deposit\" in exchange for employment and a salary.\nOn their arrival at the hotel, their wages were reduced to a fraction of the contracted amount and they were required to work far longer hours with their duties extended beyond the kitchen.\nThe men told how they had to paint the hotel, clean rooms and cut and move logs in the hotel grounds in freezing winter temperatures.\nArefin threatened his victims with termination of their employment when they complained and refused to return the money they had paid him.\nIn one case the victim described how money lenders in Bangladesh had threatened to remove his kidney as a result of his inability to pay back what he owed.\nThe crimes came to light following an investigation by the UK Border Agency and the then Northern Constabulary.\nResponding to Arefin's sentencing, Kath Harper, the Crown's national lead prosecutor for human trafficking, said: \"Arefin's greed had life-changing implications not just for his victims, but for their families and others who supported them.\n\"Human trafficking can come in many forms and as prosecutors we are committed to doing all we can do eradicate it from Scotland.\"\nKevin Hyland, independent anti-slavery commissioner, added: \"The victims of these particular crimes endured exploitation and abuse many thought was a distant memory of the past.\n\"This is a clear case of 'modern day slavery' and I commend the bravery of the four men who gave evidence at the trial.

Last week, he said women and children were being killed \"in large numbers\" by Russian raids.\nMr Medvedev said Russia was \"not trying to achieve some secret goals in Syria\", adding that \"we are trying to protect our national interests\".\nTheir comments were made at a security conference in Munich, days after world powers agreed a deal to push for a cessation of hostilities in Syria within a week.\nAgreement to try to bring about a cessation of hostilities and allow more access for humanitarian aid was reached by world powers late on Thursday in Germany, but neither the Syrian government nor the rebels were involved.\nUnder the plan, efforts will be made to try to make urgent aid deliveries to besieged and hard-to-reach areas in Syria. Steps will also be taken to work towards an eventual ceasefire and implementation of a UN-backed plan for political transition in Syria.\nThe halt will not apply to the battle against jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Nusra Front.\nThe tentative deal reached here in Munich to pause the fighting in Syria was always going to be a tough sell to the warring parties on the ground. Now its chances of success look even slimmer - \"Forty-nine per cent,\" said Russia's foreign minister. \"Closer to zero,\" said his British counterpart.\nFor much of the day the Russian and Western ministers have been trading accusations and counter-accusations as to who is to blame for the ongoing misery that is the Syrian civil war.\nFrance, Britain and the US all accused Russia of targeting mainstream rebels and civilians with air strikes while leaving so-called Islamic State largely unscathed. Russia flatly denied this, saying most of those civilians were being besieged by rebels rather than by Assad's forces. Again, Western delegates disagreed.\nSo there are clearly two, diametrically opposed, versions of what is going on in Syria. That leaves little prospect of the concerted effort for peace by all parties that is so desperately needed.\nRebel groups in Syria have told the BBC they would not stop fighting because they do not believe that Russia will end its bombing campaign in support of the government.\nThey also reiterated their demand that President Assad be removed from power. On Friday, the president said he wanted to retake \"the whole country\" from rebels.\nBut US state department spokesman Mark Toner said Mr Assad was \"deluded\" if he thought there was a military solution to the conflict.\nSyrian government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, have almost encircled rebels in parts of the northern city of Aleppo.\nMore than 250,000 people have been killed and some 11 million displaced in almost five years of fighting in Syria.\nIn another sign of the complexity of the conflict, reports said that on Saturday Turkish forces had shelled Kurdish militia targets in Aleppo provinces.\nThe Kurdish fighters had seized territory from Islamists in recent days. Turkey views the Kurdish militia as allied to the PKK group, which has a waged a campaign against Turkish security forces for decades.\nOn Saturday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Saudi Arabia would send war planes to the Turkish air base of Incirlik, from where they would attack militants in Syria from the so-called Islamic State.\nSaudi Arabia is already part of the international coalition against IS.\nMr Cavusoglu also said it was possible that troops from his country and Saudi Arabia might participate in a ground operation against IS forces. The US has so far ruled out a ground invasion.\nMoscow has warned against any new foreign ground intervention in the country, saying such a development could even lead to a world war.\nWhy is there a war in Syria?\nAnti-government protests developed into a civil war that, five years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory.\nWho is fighting whom?\nGovernment forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, as well as less numerous so-called \"moderate\" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other.\nHow has the world reacted?\nIran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes.",

    "37493670": "In the press release for the new record The Systems Are Failing, the musician writes: \"We're destroying the world, and we're still miserable. Fat, sick, stupid and anxious are no ways to live.\n\"These systems are failing. Let them fail. Change or die.\"\nWhat makes this different from a Moby album?\nI think a lot of people think of me as making sort of down-tempo quiet, electronic living room music and this record is much more of a fast, aggressive post-punk record and, based on the reactions I've had so far, people have been a little nonplussed at that.\nWhat reactions specifically? Do people think you're crazy or are they applauding a brave new direction?\nBoth in equal measure, part of what led me to want to make a record like this, is the awareness that people don't really buy records any more and people especially don't buy records from 51-year-old musicians who are making their 15th record, so with those two things in mind there's also a sense of emancipation that comes with that.\nYou can either bemoan the fact that, in 2016 the audience for albums is quite small, but I see it as being really liberating because there's no external pressure at all. I'm not trying to sell records, I'm not trying to get on the radio, I'm honestly just trying to make a record that excites me and that I think is interesting.\nYou've been very commercially successful and some might say that puts you in the privileged position of not having to worry about it.\nYes and it would be hard for me to argue that. I would feel absurdly presumptuous criticising anyone else's choices, there are a lot of musicians who have children or alimony payments or sick relatives, so they need to make commercial compromises in order to pay the rent. I'm lucky because I live a relatively simple life and I can make whatever music I want to make without any worry about any commercial ramifications.\nIn your mission statement for this project you state: 'When some of my middle-aged compatriots try to accommodate the pop market place, the results are so anodyne and depressing'. Did you have someone specific in mind?\nI did have people in mind but, in the interest of avoiding public feuds, I can't even begin to name names because in the course of my life, whenever I've criticised a fellow musician, it has ended up being something that I have truly regretted. But the truth is that a majority of musicians as they age don't do so in a graceful way. What I mean by that is, I understand that as you age, you want to hold on to your glory days and for most musicians that was decades ago, so you find yourself dressing the same way and touring and taking out your contact lenses so the audience will be blurry and look bigger than it is.  If I don't have to go down that route, I'd just as soon not.\nBut your album Play was the first album to have every track licensed to advertisers - if a corporation came to you now and asked to use Don't Leave Me from the new album - what would you do?\nI have a feeling that on my death bed the last question someone asks me before I die will be about licensing music to advertisements. At this point, most of what I do and I hesitate to say this because it does sound a little self-aggrandising but it's sincere, is that most of the work I do now is non-profit.\nI own a restaurant in LA and 100% of the profits goes to animal welfare charities and my only show this year is a fundraiser for an animal rights group. I don't mean that in a self-congratulatory way, I just mean my criteria has changed. How do my choices benefit the causes that I care about? So, if an advertiser came to me with a dump truck full of money to license a song, I would probably say \"yes\" and simply direct the dump truck to one of the organisations I work with.\nI've always tried to employ that ethos when it comes to advertising,  like \"rob from the rich and give to the poor\" or, more accurately, \"take from corporations and give to those who work against those corporations\". But even when I was being crucified for that, I really didn't want to talk about it because it seemed defensive. It made me uncomfortable trying to justify myself even if there was justification there.\nWith that and the Pacific Void manifesto, it sounds like you're having a conscientious mid-life crisis but, instead of buying a sports car, you're trying to right the world's wrongs.\nI've always been potentially an annoying, opinionated loudmouth. I was raised by very active hippies with an idea that whatever you do, in so far as you can, you should try and make the world a better place. Again, I can't be so presumptuous to say I am making it a better place but at least I want to try. There's so much, especially in the public arena, of this shameless, endless self-promotion that it just makes me nauseous.\nI don't want to be like them, there are too many horrifying pressing issues. Just putting out a new fashion line or lending your name to a perfume company would be fine if the world wasn't an inch away from catastrophe.\nIs this your main creative drive now or will you go back to recording under Moby?\nI made a record about two years ago that was very choral and so I used the name The Void Pacific Choir, which is a DH Lawrence quote because I liked it, but I scrapped the album and then started work on this one but I kept the name. But the truth is that it's me on my own so if I go back and record something under my name, it all seems kind of arbitrary to me.\nDo you intend on touring the new album?\nDear God no. It's another thing that's emancipating . Most musicians put out a record with the intent of touring and my intention is to never tour again as long as I live because I hate touring. I love playing music but going to the same airports and the same hotels and the law of diminishing returns, as you age you play smaller venues and you try and play new songs but the audience just want to hear the hits which I understand because when I go to see middle-aged musicians, I want to see the hits.\nBut if I never ever go on tour again, I would be very happy.\nHave you said everything you need to with this album?\nI've already made the follow-up record, I'm just trying to figure out when my record label will let me release it. Part two is all ready to go but clearly record companies don't love middle-aged musicians who refuse to tour, so I can't be too haughty and high-handed with them. I have to rely on their good graces.\nThe debut album by Moby & The Void Pacific Choir is released 14 October 2016.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

Some 11.5 million others - more than half of the country's population - have fled their homes.\nRebels have made numerous attempts to seize key installations held by the government, but with little effect.\nOn Thursday, 13 Islamist fighting groups and al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, came together to launch a co-ordinated assault on several fronts.\nA statement said the aim of the new coalition, called Ansar al-Sharia (Partisans of Islamic Law), was \"the liberation of Aleppo and its countryside\", after which they would work with other groups to govern the city according to Islamic law.\nWestern-backed groups also said they were taking part in the offensive, organised through a joint operations room called Fatah Halab (Conquest of Aleppo), the New York Times reported.\nThe rebels launched simultaneous attacks on western districts of the city controlled by government forces, firing hundreds of rockets and shells, the Syrian Observatory reported.\nThe offensive unleashed on government-held western Aleppo by Ansar al-Sharia seems to be the most serious since the battle for Aleppo began.\nAn early test of its prospects will be one of the first apparent objectives - the loathed and feared Air Force Intelligence headquarters in Zahra, on the western edge of the city. Rebels have tried many times to capture it, and failed.\nThe offensive has been building up for some time, following the capture of Idlib by a newly-coalesced rebel alliance, Jaish al-Fatah (Victory Army), in March.\nWhat's making the difference is that rebel groups, and their outside backers like Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which were competing in the past, now seem to be pulling together - bad news for the regime.\nThe success of the new campaign may depend on whether Damascus is seriously determined to hang on to Aleppo. If it is, rebel progress will be slow and hard.\nThe UK-based group said the fighting continued into the early hours of Friday and was focused on the frontline in Zahra, a heavily-defended area that houses several major security compounds.\nAt least nine people were killed and dozens wounded by the rebel barrage, it added.\nThe military responded with a heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of rebel positions in the city, and the fighting continued for several hours.\nOn Friday morning, military sources told Sana and Reuters news agency that the assault had been repelled and that heavy casualties had been inflicted on the rebels.\nThe Syrian Observatory said the rebels had managed to seize some buildings in the north-western outskirts of Aleppo, but that the gains were not of strategic importance.\nThe BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says that if the rebels do manage to capture all Aleppo, it would be a huge blow to the government.\nThere have been persistent reports in recent weeks that it is preparing to give up both the northern city, and Deraa in the south, the better to defend the core areas of western Syria with the limited manpower at its disposal, he adds.\nBut state media reported that the prime minister has just been in Aleppo, visiting front-line units and dispensing large amounts of cash to the city authorities for reconstruction and administrative expenses.",

This would be available in mid-2016 should anything go wrong this month.\nGlobal Xpress sees Inmarsat take its first, firm step into Ka frequencies to deliver communications.\nTraditionally, its spacecraft have worked in the L-band.\nThe higher frequency of Ka allows faster throughput connections, giving the new satellites broadband speeds that are 100 times faster than the company's previous generation of spacecraft.\n\"If there has been any benefit from the delay, it's that it has allowed us to fix network issues that we would have had anyway in this period,\" said Mr Franci\n\"So, once we go really live at the end of the year, the network will be more stable and more reliable.

[Don't worry, BBC graphics designers, I'm not seriously thinking of doing this. Not yet at least!]\nBut the important point here is that the composition of the different magnets and their respective strengths would be very different from one constituency to another.\nIn this era of multi-party politics, every single seat is more or less a law unto itself.\nTake for example two of our key local marginals, Dudley North and Solihull.\nIn the Black Country seat, Labour are defending a majority of just 649.\nIn 2010 their closest challengers were the Conservatives. This time, though, with nine seats on the local council its is UKIP who are breathing down Labour's neck.\nSolihull is another key Conservative target. The Liberal Democrats had a majority over them of just 175 last time round. But since then, the Green Party has established itself as a real force in the town, thanks to a potent combination of green belt and housing issues.\nExtreme examples though they may be, these two constituencies reinforce the point that whether or not UKIP or the Greens succeed in winning seats themselves, or even come close to doing so, they will undoubtedly have significant and differing impacts on the established parties from one seat to another.\nLike a collection of by-elections perhaps?\nThat may be overstating it. But I am becoming increasingly convinced that this election offers us regional and local broadcasters a unique opportunity to explore the local dynamics of individual seats and to explain the possibility that in the shake-out of seats between the biggest parties it is not unreasonable to envisage gains and losses in both directions.\nAnd what does this tell us about those headline national poll ratings pointing to a hung Parliament, in which the two biggest parties in lock step with each other followed by UKIP, the Liberal Democrats and then the Greens?\nOr, about those \"percentage swing to win or lose\" statistics which have been calculated in a predominantly two-party environment?\nAll it tells us is how little they tell us.\n\"Never assume\" said the recently-departed doyen of cricket commentators Richie Benaud.\nIn an election as unpredictable as this, maybe the assumptions about a hung Parliament are themselves suspect.

Early predications refer to a \u00c2\u00a320bn inward investment, nearly 2,000 new jobs and an unquantifiable impact on tourism and leisure.\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) there's an International Woman's Day flavour to question time, with questions on: the UN framework preventing violence against women, gender inequality, discriminatory practices and harmful cultural and social norms, from Baroness Kinnock; improving the reading skills of 16 to 24-year-old women, from Baroness Rebuck and on increasing the representation of women in political and public life, from Baroness Gale.\nThen peers turn to the detail of the Housing and Planning Bill - in the fourth day of seven of committee stage - and already the debate is lagging well behind schedule, raising the prospect that the bill might not get to its report stage immediately after Easter, as planned.\nThe sections under scrutiny on Tuesday include right to buy for tenants of housing association properties and high value council property sales. This is the a contentious part of the bill - but, as usual, committee stage debates are preliminary sparring, and no votes are expected; but the debates will foreshadow amendments for report stage, when a serious attempt to re-write these provisions looks likely.\nThere will also be a short debate on a political solution to the civil war in Syria- led by the Bishop of Coventry.\nThe Commons meets at 11.30am - for half an hour of questions to the ministers at the Cabinet Office, the government's \"engine room,\" followed, at noon by questions to the prime minister.\nPlaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts has a Ten Minute Rule Bill calling for the law on cyber-crime to be brought together from around 30 different statutes, and for new duties to be imposed on internet service providers and social media companies, to remove offensive material.\nShe has cross party support and this looks very much like the start of a campaign, rather in the tradition of her predecessor, Elfyn Llywd, who scored significant success in toughening up the law on stalking.\nThen MPs move on to the detail of the Enterprise Bill - where the crunch vote will be on an amendment, spearheaded by Tory backbencher David Burrowes, and signed by 22 Conservatives, to delete the government's proposals to loosen restrictions on Sunday trading.\nLabour will be whipped to back it, the Northern Ireland DUP is on board - but it looks as if the SNP will not be. There's also an amendment from the former Cabinet Minister Caroline Spellman which would allow a limited relaxation in Sunday opening hours for larger shops.\nThe day's Westminster Hall debates cover BT service standards (9.30am-11am); the government's proposals on fixed recoverable costs in clinical negligence claims (11am-11.30am); the contribution of the Scotch whisky industry to the UK economy (2.30pm-4pm); the management of the Health and Safety Executive (4pm- 4.30pm) and competition in the UK energy market (4.30-5.30pm).\nIn the Lords (3pm) peers launch into the report stage of the Immigration Bill, where votes are expected on amendments dealing with overseas domestic workers and permission to work for asylum seekers. Watch out, too, for an amendment from Lords Alton and Forsyth, and Baroness Cox, to guarantee asylum for people fleeing genocide, as defined in the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide; and from Lord Dubs, to allow for asylum for people employed by the UK Government in Iraq or Afghanistan.\nThe really big clash over this bill, on unaccompanied child migrants, will come the following week - unless the government makes a pre-emptive concession.\nThere will be a lot of interest on the debate on the report from the special committee set up to examine the impact on trade union political funds and (Labour) party funding (the Burns Report, after the crossbench peer who chaired the committee).\nThe Committee suggested a number of fixes which would reduce the impact of the current proposals in the Trade Union Bill - which have been denounced as a partisan attack by the government on Labour.\nThis will be the first chance to debate them and to get a response from ministers. And the committee report will tee up a series of amendments when the bill comes to report stage, on Wednesday 16 March. Opposition parties are waiting to see the colour of the minister's money on this issue - but even if the government signs up to the Burns Report compromise, there's still plenty left in this bill to argue about - not insisting on postal ballots and allowing e-voting for union ballots, the \"check-off\" system for deducting union subs from pay-packets, facility time for union reps and much more.\nThe various sides are still circling each other and we could still see a long drawn-out bout of trench warfare when report stage commences.\nThe Commons opens (9.30am) with Transport questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Chris Grayling. He will be under considerable pressure to announce the dates of forthcoming parliamentary recesses, and of the next Queen's Speech. MPs are particularly keen to know whether there will be a recess covering the EU Referendum and whether the the start of the next parliamentary year will be put back until after the referendum, implying a State Opening ceremony in July.\nThen MPs turn to the report stage and third reading of the Northern Ireland (Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan) Bill 2015-16, which implements the latest deal on the powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The scheduling implies that the powers that be don't expect any great controversy over this measure, and that the debate will be fairly brief.\nThe decision to end the centuries-old practice of recording Acts of Parliament on vellum - treated cow skin - will be raised in a Backbench Business Committee debate. James Gray, a member of the House of Commons Commission, which signed up to that decision (which came from the Lords) wants to carry on using vellum - and it may all come down to how much it would cost to keep it, and who pays.\nIn the Lords (from 11am) peers debate the detailed provisions on \"pay to stay\" and ending secure tenancies, in the Housing and Planning Bill (see Tuesday, above).\nThere will also be a short debate on the renewal of the BBC's Charter, led by the Liberal Democrat Baroness Bonham-Carter. As I write there are 16 peers are down to speak, which is quite a turnout for a short debate on a Thursday - suggesting there's a considerable level of interest in this issue in the Upper House.\nThe Commons meets (9.30am) to debate private members' bills - I'll list what's down on the Order Paper at the moment, but it's an increasingly inaccurate guide to what actually happens on the day. The main reason for this is that we're now approaching the end of the parliamentary year, where cunning operators like the wily Peter Bone angle to get second reading debate on issues they want to raise - although they then have little prospect of becoming law.\nBut the announcement of the date of the EU referendum has put Mr Bone, one of the prime movers in the increasingly important Grassroots Out organisation, into campaign mode, and he has not been able to be in the Chamber to move some of the many bills he has put down for debate.\nHis close ally, Christopher Chope, has stepped into the breach to move some of those bills - specialising in the ones with an EU dimension. But sadly we're unlikely to get a debate on the Prime Minister (Temporary Appointment) Bill, which would have provided a mechanism, in case the PM was run over by a bus.\nFor the record, the current batting order is:  Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) Bill (Peter Bone); National Health Service Bill (Caroline Lucas); Criminal Cases Review Commission (Supplementary Powers) Bill (Andy McDonald); Regulation of Enforcement Agents (Collection of Council Tax Arrears) Bill (Yvonne Fovargue); Health Services Commissioning (Equality and Accountability) (No. 2) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Perinatal Mental Illness (NHS Family Services) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Scotland Act 1998 (Amendment) Bill (Angus Brendan MacNeil) and the House of Lords (Parliamentary Standards Etc) Bill (Sir Edward Leigh).\nThere are many more bills listed, and if some of those above are not moved, they may even be debated - if their movers are there to do so.\nIt's also private members' bill day in the Lords (10am) where peers will consider the Gambling (Categorisation and Use of B2 Gaming Machines) Bill and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (Information) Bill. More bills may be added to this list.",

I hit the first one as hard as I really could considering how close the pin was to the edge of the green.\"\nThe world number four went straight to the practice green after taking 35 putts in round one but he said his efforts on Friday, when he took 30, were \"pathetic\".\n\"Putting let me down at [the US Open in June at] Oakmont and then putting let me down here again,\" he said.\n\"My tee to green game - there's not much wrong with that. It's pretty solid. If you had given anyone else in this field my tee shots this week, they would have been up near the top of the leaderboard.\n\"It just shows you how bad I was around the greens.\"\nThe Swede was grouped with the year's other two major winners - Masters champion Danny Willett and US Open victor Dustin Johnson - and he outscored them on both days.\nHe dropped to one under par after three-putt bogeys on the 12th and 13th holes but a three-foot eagle putt on the par-five 18th, his ninth, followed by three birdies on the front nine, moved him one clear of the field.\n\"I got off to a bit of a wobbly start and stood over a six-foot putt on the 14th to avoid going three over, so I'm quite happy that went in and I turned it on from 18,\" said the 40-year-old, who won his first major at Royal Troon two weeks ago.\n\"That could easily have gone the wrong way but I was hanging in there and got the good stuff coming in.\"\nWillett birdied the ninth to card a 70 and make the cut on one over, but pre-tournament favourite Johnson is going home after adding a 72 to his opening 77 for a nine-over total.\nNeither American has never won a major and while Walker has five victories on the PGA Tour, Streb has just one and has missed nine cuts in 23 events in 2016.\nWalker, 37, made a solid start to round two with two birdies and seven pars in his opening nine holes before moving clear of the field with a run of three successive birdies from the 12th.\nHe pulled his tee shot on the 17th into a hospitality area and escaped with a free drop and par five but an almost identical shot on the last was not so lucky, ending up in a lake and resulting in a dropped shot.\n\"The finish wasn't what I was looking for, but it's fine,\" said Walker. \"I think you take 66 at any tournament all day every day. So it's good.\n\"I will watch the leaderboard on Saturday. I don't think that's a big deal. I enjoy watching it.

I enjoyed the last few holes,\" he said. \"It was important for me to finish the way I did.\"\nAndrew Johnston continued to impress in the majors, after finishing tied for eighth at The Open, with a one-under-par 69 to reach halfway at one under.\nThe Englishman, better known by his nickname 'Beef', started on the 10th and was two under after nine holes. He dropped back to level with bogeys on the fifth and seventh holes, but he then birdied the eighth.\n\"Every hole, man, I get so many nice comments,\" said the 27-year-old. \"Even after the fifth hole, when I three-putted, they are like, 'Don't worry, Beef, come on, bounce back, you've got this one'.

    "30206231": "David Anderson QC said his \"central concern\" about the proposals first unveiled by David Cameron in early September was: \"Where are the courts?\"\nTemporary Exclusion Orders are one of the measures in the counter terrorism bill published by Theresa May.\nIt also includes tougher powers to stop people going abroad to fight.\nIt will include plans to stop some British citizens returning to the UK, and others from leaving the country.\nIn other developments on Wednesday:\nAnalysis by Political Correspondent Robin Brant\nThe government proposes the law, parliament passes it, then David Anderson reviews it - and sometimes makes recommendations. That's the usual sequence of events.\nBut today the independent reviewer was criticising the process before the new Counter-Terror and Security Bill was published.\nThe QC used his customary polite, sometimes understated, tone - but this was a criticism of politicians whom he said hadn't fully thought through some of the proposals announced in early September.\nRead more from Robin\nMrs May's new measures to tackle terrorism come days after she said the UK faces a \"greater\" terror threat than ever before.\nThe measures include requiring airlines to pass on details of their passengers and changes to the way TPIMs - Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures - work to monitor terror suspects who cannot be prosecuted.\nBut campaigners have condemned it, saying it threatens civil liberties.\n'A more sensible way'\nMr Anderson - appointed by the government to be its independent reviewer of terrorism legislation - said the new anti-terror legislation was \"nothing like as dramatic\" as David Cameron had proposed earlier this year.\nHe told the Joint Committee on Human Rights the original plan to block suspected British jihadists returning from Iraq and Syria as \"an announcement waiting for a policy\".\nBut he said it soon became clear such a move would \"neither legally or practically\" work and the current plan was now much \"closer to managed return\".\nHe argued there could be \"a more sensible\" way of dealing with some people suspected of being involved in terrorist activities.\n\"One could look at it in terms of young, possibly vulnerable people caught up with the wrong crowd in Syria - didn't really know exactly what they were doing,\" he said.\n\"Do you want to throw the book at them straight away in terms of arrest and charge? Or is there something to be said, even though you do suspect them of having fought, of keeping them under a very light regime where they might have to report daily to a police station?\nThe new Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill includes:\n\"They might have to notify their residence; they might have to go along to meetings with probation or with some similar which perhaps might be for some people be a more sensible way of dealing with them than putting them straight into the criminal justice process.\"\nMr Anderson said the use of exclusion orders would require the cooperation of carriers, such as airlines and of states where these people might find themselves.\n\"But certainly presented with an order at the check-in desk, the person might say: 'I want to come home,' or decide not to come home,\" he said.\n\"The concern I have about this power and the central concern about it is: where are the courts in all of this?\n\"If the home secretary wants to impose a TPIM she has to go to the court first and if the court says she's got it wrong, it will say so.\n\"One will want to look very carefully to see if this is a power that requires the intervention of the court at any stage, or whether it's simply envisaged as something the home secretary imposes.\n\"If one is abroad when this order is served on you, then it's a little difficult to see in practical terms how a right to judicial review could be exercised.\"\nMr Anderson spoke out as a week-long counter-terrorism awareness campaign enters its third day.\n'Changing threats'\nThe UK's terror threat level remains \"severe\" after it was upped from \"substantial\" earlier this year in response to conflicts in Iraq and Syria.\nSpeaking ahead of the bill's publication, Mrs May said: \"We are in the middle of a generational struggle against a deadly terrorist ideology. These powers are essential to keep up with the very serious and rapidly changing threats we face.\n\"This bill includes a considered, targeted set of proposals that will help to keep us safe at a time of very significant danger by ensuring we have the powers we need to defend ourselves.\"\nThe government wants to \"fast-track\" the bill through Parliament, citing the need to tackle the direct threat posed by the group calling itself Islamic State (IS) and the increasing number of Britons travelling to Iraq and Syria to fight on its behalf.\nBut shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said more was needed to be done to stop British citizens from being radicalised and to deal with any threat this posed to national security.\nAmnesty International called the powers \"draconian\", adding none of the measures seemed \"properly thought through\".\nAnd Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty, said: \"Yet again, politicians resort to high talk and rushed legislation in an attempt to look tough in the face of terrorism. Another chilling recipe for injustice and resentment by closing down the open society you seek to promote.\"\nThe Home Office says communications data has played a major role in \"every Security Service counter-terrorism operation over the last decade\" but gaps in the UK's access to such information need to be filled.\nMrs May has warned that even the new data retention powers will not fully address the threat, reiterating the need for a Communications Data Bill to bring in more wide-ranging web monitoring powers.\nThat bill - labelled a snooper's charter by critics - was scrapped following Lib Dem opposition.\nTechnology firms said there had been insufficient consultation on the more limited proposals in the bill requiring firms to keep information to help the authorities to match internet protocol (IP) addresses to an individual user or a device.\nThe Home Office said it had met internet service providers and other groups to discuss the measures but the Internet Services Providers Association said there had been \"a distinct lack of engagement\" with the industry.\nMinisters want to amend legislation passed earlier this year to require firms to retain data, including that \"required to identify the sender or recipient of a communication, the time or duration of a communication, the type, method or pattern of communication and the telecommunications system used\".\nHowever, the bill stresses that the content of messages and details that would \"explicitly identify\" what websites someone had visited would not have to be stored.\nOn Tuesday a report into last year's killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby raised questions about whether social network providers should have to report details of extremist activity.\nDavid Cameron said companies had a \"social responsibility\" to act on terrorist material posted online after the report detailed how Michael Adebowale, one of two men convicted of Mr Rigby's murder, spoke on Facebook about wanting to murder a soldier.\nFacebook said it did not allow terrorist content and aimed to stop it.",

It's a place you just really want to go.\nThat message permeates, and has made it into one of the most desirable races on the calendar.\nFor a start, the ambience is terrific - and, let's be honest, this is what appeals to the business visitors, rather than the demands of racing on one of the longest tracks in F1 in crippling humidity.\nSingapore is a fascinating destination full stop, thanks to its place at the crossroads of south-east Asia and colonial past. But hosting the race at night adds an extra dimension.\nThe track jags through the city centre under lights, Chinese lanterns adding a dash of colour, the futuristic city skyline the backdrop.\nAs the sun sets, the whole place seems to shimmer and sparkle for a while.

I felt I had been tossed to the one side, I had no feelings of self worth,\" added Mr Birnie.\nSeveral months after the incident, Mr Birnie made an official complaint to the Northern Health and Social Care Trust.\nIn a letter to Mr Birnie dated October 2015 and seen by the BBC, the trust explained that as he was so unwell they had spoken to his sister.\nThe trust also said that if the infection had caused his heart to stop, medical staff would not have been able to bring him back and that attempts at cardio respiratory resuscitation would not have been in his best interests.\nHowever, Mr Birnie said he does not accept that a DNR notice was placed on his file in advance of him being admitted without his or his sister's consent.\nIn a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for the Northern Health Trust confirmed that a DNR notice was placed on Mr Birnie's file in January 2014, but not before a conversation had taken place with their patient.\n\"The decision to implement a DNR is a medical one, which is taken in cases where medical professionals feel that if a person's medical condition at that time causes their heart to stop, resuscitation attempts would be futile and therefore not in their best interests in providing a dignified death.\n\"This was discussed with Mr Birnie initially and was put in place following a conversation with his next of kin who indicated that they had talked it over with Mr Birnie and agreed with the decision taken,\" the statement said.\n\"A DNR notice is reviewed and, if felt appropriate, renewed on a daily basis. There is currently no DNR on Mr Birnie's file and his treatment remains unaffected.\"\nA DNR notice is an extremely sensitive issue. Often the subject can arise when a person least expects it or is not in a position to make a rational judgement.\nThe order means medical staff will not attempt to bring the patient back to life if they stop breathing or their heart stops.\nThe decision to use one is ultimately a doctor's, but official guidelines from the British Medical Association (BMA) state medical staff have a duty to discuss it with relatives wherever possible.\nThe problem for medical staff is that sometimes the conversation between doctor and the patient or family may not take place in time.\nThe usual circumstances in which it is appropriate not to resuscitate are when it will not restart the heart or breathing; when there is no benefit to the patient; and when the benefits are outweighed by the burdens.\nThe guidelines also say that it should only be issued after discussions with the patient or family.\nHowever, according to Neill Birnie that did not happen.\nAs a quadriplegic who requires 24-hour care via the computer, he told me he is still a human being with feelings: \"The lights are still on and I am definitely at home.\"\nVia his voice-activated computer, he told a rude joke that made me laugh.

You have to hike up to above 2,500m to find the gibbons. That's where the good quality forest usually starts - everywhere below there has been logged.\n\"Then you have to wake up really early in the morning and you listen out for the haunting song of the gibbons, which carries in the forest canopy.\n\"And when you hear it, you rush through the mud and the mist, and run for hundreds of metres to try and catch up with these gibbons.\"\nThe researchers estimate that there are about 200 of the Skywalker gibbons living in China - and also some living in neighbouring Myanmar, although the population size there is currently unknown.\nThe team warns that the primates are at risk of extinction.\n\"The low number of surviving animals and the threat they face from habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and hunting means we think they should be classified as an endangered species,\" said Dr Turvey.\nIn response to the news, actor Mark Hamill - the original Luke Skywalker - said on Twitter that he was so proud to have a new jungle Jedi named after his character.\nFollow Rebecca on Twitter.",

    "40122246": "Regardless of the horse race that sprung from Lord Derby calling it right and winning that toss at Epsom in 1779, defeat would have had a much wider significance.\nThe event and its name are believed to be the root of the expression 'derby match', and it's worth considering that the loser was Sir Charles Bunbury.\nYou'll agree the 'Merseyside Bunbury' or the 'North London Bunbury' hardly have the same ring.\nMore than two centuries on from that coin toss to decide whose name the race should take, trainer John Gosden - who is due to have five runners in the 238th Derby, including big fancy Cracksman - marvels at what was created.\n\"It's a unique track,\" he says, staring out over the course as it snakes its way up, down and around the Surrey Downs barely 15 miles south west of central London.\n\"Obviously Bunbury and Derby had had a very good lunch when they came up here and pegged it out and flipped a coin.\n\"It's a very demanding track. You have to stay, you have to have great dexterity, agility, balance and a turn of foot comes in very handy.\n\"It is a proper test of a horse - you wouldn't necessarily design it as a track for anything other than a rigorous test of a three-year-old in the first week of June, and that's what it is.\"\nGosden, whose ever-powerful string based at Newmarket is the biggest threat to the prevailing dominance of Ireland's Aidan O'Brien, should know.\nIt's 20 years since he saddled Benny The Dip to win, and two since he masterminded Golden Horn's big-race success with Frankie Dettori riding in the silks of owner-breeder Anthony Oppenheimer.\nGolden Horn, who by that point had won the regularly significant Dante Stakes at York, went on to stamp his authority on proceedings that season.\nAfter Epsom, he galloped off with the Eclipse Stakes, the Irish Champion Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe before suffering one of just two defeats, at the Breeders' Cup fixture in Kentucky.\nCracksman represents the same owner-trainer-jockey combination, and comes to Epsom with two wins from two starts, the second at Epsom when narrowly beating fellow Derby hopeful - and this year's Dante winner - Permian.\n\"Cracksman is not a Golden Horn,\" Gosden told BBC Sport, \"but he's a superior horse to Benny The Dip.\n\"He's still learning a lot, and when he came here and won the trial he grew up overnight, so we're excited.\"\nBelieving there is no standout in this year's Derby, worth a total of nearly \u00a31.625m - a record, Gosden fields three more runners than ever before.\nCracksman, who like fellow leading contender Eminent is a son of champion racehorse-turned-fledgling stallion Frankel, is joined by striking Goodwood winner Khalidi - added as a late entry, for \u00a385,000 - plus three longer shots in Crowned Eagle, Glencadam Glory and Pealer.\nA multitude of runners under a single, or near-single, banner is something of a feature of the 2017 staging of the world's best-known flat racing prize.\nO'Brien - looking for a sixth win after Galileo, High Chaparral, Camelot, Ruler Of The World and Australia - saddles another formidable Coolmore-owned challenge.\nCliffs Of Moher, winner of the Dee Stakes at Chester, with Ryan Moore riding, leads six, ahead of well-supported Capri and Venice Beach. Douglas Macarthur, The Anvil - on which the trainer's apprentice jockey daughter Ana becomes the third female jockey to take part - and Wings Of Eagle make up the raiding party.\nO'Brien's son Joseph, the jockey on board when Camelot and Australia were victorious but now training, saddles Rekindling.\nVia his Godolphin operation and his son Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed, owner Sheikh Mohammed is represented by Permian, Lingfield Trial winner Best Solution, once-raced Dubai Thunder and Benbatl, the Dante Stakes runner-up.\nStrongly supported Eminent, sixth in the 2000 Guineas, trained by Martyn Meade and the mount of flat racing's champion jockey Jim Crowley, heads 'the rest'.\nIt does look genuinely wide open.\n\"We don't have any exceptional favourite standing out and frightening everyone away,\" said Gosden, whose father 'Towser' trained 1966 winner Charlottown as a two-year-old before ill health forced his own retirement.\n\"That's why we're winding up with a pretty big field. But I still think that the first three will be very, very good horses.\n\"The biggest problem is probably going to be for the jockeys getting around in a big field. You try riding around Epsom with so many other runners. It's not an easy job at all.\"\nFood for thought for apprentice jockey Paddy Pilley, who replaces Gina Mangan - barred from taking part on safety grounds - on 1,000-1 outsider Diore Lia.\nHowever, the presence of Diore Lia, the large field and the chance for Frankel to father a first European Classic winner gives the whole thing an intriguing narrative.\nIt'll take a lot more than a spin of a coin to sort out this one.",

She'd turn around and say I'm not allowed.\n\"Whatever was going on in her head was so strong she just couldn't comply.\"\nHer mother, Marie, said it \"was just horrific\" and \"a nightmare.\"\n\"[Pippa] hated herself. She thought she was the ugliest person in the world. Whatever you said, it didn't make a difference because that's what the anorexia was telling her.\n\"We needed some trained mental health workers to work with us but they weren't there to do that... We were let down by everybody I think. Everybody had a part to play.\"\nDeborah Coles, director of INQUEST, a charity that supported the family during the court process, said her parents' \"concerns were dismissed and minimised throughout\".\n\"Pip's death has exposed a mental health system which pushed through the discharge of a highly vulnerable child without any of the support or care in place to make sure she would be safe,\" she said.",

In some cases, they are changing the voting habits of a lifetime.\nThe first switcher was just a few blocks from the Republican convention location. Tim - who didn't want to give his last name - is a lawyer who works in Cleveland's Key Tower, the tallest building between Chicago and Philadelphia. A lifelong Republican, he believes that Mr Trump is not just telling tall stories, but dangerous ones.\n\"I am very concerned about any leader who appeals to the worst instincts of human nature. That's very dangerous for the country and I love my country more than I love my party.\"\nSo will he vote for Hillary Clinton? \"I may. I haven't quite got there, but I definitely won't vote for Donald Trump. Anyone who knows me knows how ridiculous that sounds, that I would even think of voting for her.\"\nI heard a very different view in the run-down town of Warren, 50 miles east of Cleveland. At the 422 restaurant, the only place to eat on what local people say was once a bustling strip, I met a group of disillusioned Democrats. They used to work at the town's steel mill, which is now nothing more than a fenced-off patch of wasteland.\nAs jobs, opportunities and hopes have disappeared, so too has the loyalty they felt - or were encouraged to feel by the unions - towards the Democratic Party. During the 35 years that Joe Shrodek worked in the mill's blast furnace, he always voted for Democratic presidential candidates. But not this time.\n\"When I was there I voted Democrat the whole time, the unions endorsed [the candidate]. All that's gone now. I just want change, that's all. They need to clean house in Washington.\"\nSo, is Mr Trump the man to do that?\n\"I don't know,\" he says, \"but I'm voting for him.\"\nWatching Joe and his friends mop up the restaurant's roasted hot pepper dip with slices of white bread, local Republican Party chairman Randy Law predicts that Mr Trump will soak up the votes of many other white working class voters like them.\n\"I see it every day. People calling me, emailing me. There is this anti-Hillary feeling. People seeing it as a third term for Obama. People are fed up with a lot of those policies that have hurt big business, small business and trade and people are tired of being politically correct.\"\nCrossing the state line into Pennsylvania, another swing state, where polls suggest a tight contest, I encountered a different type of switcher. Judie Radel, who owns the Yee Haw farm in Duncannon, has always voted Democrat. She was a Bernie Sanders supporter in the primaries. Patting her \"girls\" - the milk cows she tends on the 160 acres she farms - she says that she's leaning Republican.\n\"I don't trust Hillary. We've had eight years of a Hillary administration and I think we need change.\"\nShe says that she enjoyed Mr Trump's speech at the Republican convention. \"I like that it was a doom and gloom speech that didn't sugar coat what's going down in our country. Our country's in dire straits right now. We need to wake up.\"\nShe expresses some misgivings about a Trump finger on the nuclear button, but doesn't think it disqualifies him from the White House.\nAn hour south-east of Yee Haw farm, in Pennsylvania's more affluent Lancaster County, Ann Womble is rather more concerned. She has been an active Republican Party member for 30 years and was a delegate to the 2012 convention in Tampa.\nBut the Trump takeover has led her to take a big decision - she's just cancelled her party membership. She dismisses comparisons between the reality TV star, Donald Trump, and the Hollywood actor, Ronald Reagan, who first attracted her to the party.\n\"Reagan's candidacy was a sunny, happy conservative insurgency into the Republican Party, because it was optimistic. Now, we're in the opposite place. Trump is attracting people to his candidacy for dark, gloomy and dangerous reasons.\n\"His view is of an autocratic, almost Third World leader. If he were actually president of the United States and tweeting these things that he tweets all hours of the day, saying these things to camera, it could be apocalyptic.\"\nBut, despite that assessment, Ann can't bring herself to vote for the Republican Party's bogeywoman, Mrs Clinton, in November. Although she'll support Republican candidates for Congress, she may not vote in the presidential election at all.\nAnd that represents one of the challenges for the Democratic Party.\nWhile disillusioned Democrats are embracing Mr Trump, disillusioned Republicans find it much harder to support his opponent. Mrs Clinton's convention may project a positive vision of America. But to really succeed it needs to address and counter the negative impression that many Americans have of her.",

Not an unqualified one - there are some quibbles - but in all key respects, it grips, it stirs, it delights.\"\nCavendish praises the \"thrill-a-minute\" stage craft which sees pupils heading to Hogwarts, at the start of the play, change into school uniforms \"in the blink of an eye\" as they head to the infamous Platform 9\u00c2\u00be to make their way to school.\nThe Stage also gives a five-star review, with Mark Shenton describing Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - co-devised by Rowling, with director John Tiffany and playwright Jack Thorne - as a \"truly game-changing production and a thrilling theatrical endeavour\".\nIt is an \"entirely original\" piece of work, with \"Dickensian sweep and momentum to the storytelling\", writes Shenton, adding: \"It earns its place on the stage, feeling distinct from both the books and the screen adaptations.\n\"By turns playful and gripping, disturbing and detailed, poignant and powerful, it is superb family entertainment.\"\nShenton also praises \"the theatrical wizards who've created this stunningly-realised alternative universe deliver one coup de theatre after another\".\nIn a nod to the Kings Cross platform number, Ann Treneman gives the play four and three-quarters stars in The Times, saying the \"wizardry on display\" is \"out of this world\".\nShe says the plot is complex (\"there are mazes that are more straightforward\") but adds: \"It's a raunchless Game of Thrones with heart.

    "33733410": "There were celebrations in Europe after Germany surrendered.\nBut on the other side of the world in the Pacific Ocean, Japan was still fighting against America, Britain and their allies.\nThe Americans, however, had a secret plan to end the war - by using the most powerful weapon ever created.\nOn 6 August 1945, at 8.15am Japanese time, an American B-29 bomber plane, called 'Enola Gay', dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.\nThe devastation was beyond anything seen before. The city was immediately flattened.\n80,000 people were killed as a direct result of the blast, and another 35,000 were injured.\nEven then, Japan didn't surrender.\nThree days later, another nuclear bomb was dropped by the Americans on the Japanese city of Nagasaki.\nShortly afterwards, on 15 August 1945, Japan finally admitted defeat.\nWorld War Two was over.\nWhen the bomb exploded in Hiroshima, the city has struck by a flash of blinding light then a giant cloud shaped like a mushroom.\nThe blast flattened buildings within a 2.5 km radius of the bomb.\nThere were 90,000 buildings in Hiroshima before the bomb was dropped but only 28,000 remained after the explosion.\nThousands and thousands of people were killed.  Many were badly injured.\nBut the suffering didn't end there because it wasn't just a normal bomb.\nThe nuclear radiation released when it exploded caused people to suffer horrible illnesses.\nThousands more people died from their injuries and radiation sickness in the weeks, months and years that followed.\nJapan was at war with America and its allies, which included Britain and Soviet Union (a nation made up of modern-day Russia and other countries).\nThe allies were winning the war and the Japanese forces had been pushed back from many locations.\nHowever fighting was still very fierce and soldiers and civilians were dying every day.\nJapan had been at war for many years.\nIt had invaded the countries near to it such as China and the Japanese had attacked America.\nEverywhere the Japanese soldiers went, they were known for their cruelty.\nThey treated prisoners of war very badly, including  American and British soldiers who had surrendered.\nUS President Harry S Truman wanted the Japanese to surrender as quickly as possible so he could save lives.\nThe atomic bomb was a deadly new weapon.\nPresident Truman hoped the massive destruction it caused would shock the Japanese into realising they had to surrender.\nUS President Truman wanted to avoid a land invasion of Japan.\nThere were 2.5 million Japanese troops stationed there and Truman's staff estimated that defeating them would cost the lives of 250,000 US soldiers.\nSome historians also say that the US wanted to avoid Japan being occupied by Soviet troops.\nAmerica and the Soviet Union were allies but they did not really trust each other.\nIt was the first and only time that atomic bombs have been used in a war.\nAlthough the scientists who made the bombs were proud of what they'd achieved, it scared them as well.\nThe way the atomic bomb was built meant it had huge power - enough to destroy whole cities on it's own.\nMany people now believe that the devastation caused in Hiroshima, and in Nagasaki, was so awful that the bombs should never be used again.\nToday, a small number of countries around the world, including USA, China and the UK, have nuclear weapons.\nSome campaigners argue that there is no place for nuclear weapons and that all countries should get rid of them immediately.\nOthers say that having such terrible weapons will keep a country safe, even if they are never used.",

Or would research rivals in Germany or China snap them up to the detriment of the UK economy?\nShowing how seriously they take this, Oxford University has appointed its own head of Brexit strategy.\nSo you could say that at least Brexit has already created one extra job.\nBut this new postholder, Professor Alistair Buchan, saw leaving the EU as threatening to relegate the UK's universities behind their global competition.\nOxford has been ranked as the world's top university, but Prof Buchan said that in 1970s the UK's universities did not have that top status. This had been built through the EU years and growing networks of international partnerships.\nHe described Brexit for universities as the \"Manchester United problem\".\nWhy would any football team with international ambitions deliberately want to restrict its access both to better talent and to bigger markets?\nThere were warnings about the financial impact of losing European research funding.\nThe UK's universities are among the biggest winners from Horizon 2020 research network, bringing more than \u00c2\u00a32bn into the higher education sector.\nThis is no small-bi\u00c3\u00a8re, with some individual universities worrying about the loss of hundreds of millions.\nIf the UK is to stay ahead in research, Dr Anne Corbett of the LSE said the UK government had to be ready for some \"serious funding\".\nProfessor Stephanie Haywood, president of the Engineering Professors' Council, warned that losing access to EU students would make skills shortages in engineering even worse.\nBut could there be an upside in higher tuition fees?\nIf EU students are designated as overseas students after Brexit, UK universities could charge them much higher fees.\nBut such a tuition fee windfall depends on those students not staying at home or going somewhere else.\nProf Barnard raised the example of those talented eastern European mathematicians.\nWould they really be able to pay \u00c2\u00a317,000 or so a year? Or would it mean that universities in the UK would have pay for scholarships rather than see them go elsewhere?\nCommittee chairman Neil Carmichael pushed his witnesses for more evidence and facts.\nBut what came back most often was even more questions.

In conversations late last year, he was still exultant at his own role in triggering the invasion which unseated Saddam Hussein. For him, that was the overarching goal that justified any possible means.\nBut it was not just the removal of the dictator that plunged Iraq into the chaos which has continued to shake and fragment the country ever since.\nIn the months that followed, every political and security structure holding the country together was dismantled, including the all-pervasive Baath Party (a process in which Ahmed Chalabi played a role), the army and the intelligence services.\nThousands of highly experienced officers and officials from Saddam Hussein's minority Sunni community were sent home with a burning grudge, setting the scene for the subsequent Sunni-based insurgency, sectarian fragmentation and blood-letting, and the eventual emergence of IS.\nIS began in Iraq and later spread to Syria, where it could exploit the chaos and vacuums caused by the civil war to entrench and grow, eventually erupting back into Iraq with the storming of Mosul last year.\nNow it is firmly entrenched in both countries, and the prospects for pulling both of them back together as unitary states are daunting, given the degree of fragmentation in both.\nThat is the spectre haunting the West, as it ponders how to deal with a crisis that has sent millions of refugees into neighbouring countries, and hundreds of thousands flooding into Europe.\nDoing nothing may increasingly not be an option. But the fate of Iraq since 2003 underscores the potentially disastrous dangers of ill-conceived meddling.",

The USAF lease the RAF bases.\nMr Hagel said he understood it would mean job losses and thanked those who had supported the US Air Force.\n\"I know that this will result in a reduction of our local host nations workforces at some locations; I value the tremendous support they provided us for decades.\"\nThe USAF KC-135 tanker fleet based at Mildenhall will be moved to Germany.\nRAF Lakenheath, with two squadrons of new F-35 jets (48 of them) arriving by 2020, will be the aircraft's only European base.\nThe Pentagon said the loss of about 2,000 US military and civilian personnel is due to relocation away from Mildenhall, but will be offset by the addition of about 1,200 people stationed permanently at Lakenheath.\nMatthew Hancock, West Suffolk MP and Minister of State for Business, Enterprise and Energy, said he would support the community affected.\nMildenhall had a long and proud history of strong relations with the United States Air Force and the move \"will come as a shock to many\", he said.\n\"I have met with the defence secretary, and others in government to ensure we can work, together with the American administration, to support the community.\n\"We will create a Mildenhall, Alconbury and Molesworth (MAM) Working Group, which I will chair, inviting local LEPs [local enterprise partnerships], councils, the Ministry of Defence and US representatives to ensure no stone is left unturned in supporting Mildenhall and the surrounding area.\"\nA UK Ministry of Defence spokesman said: \"The US Department of Defence (DoD) has been reviewing its requirement for bases across Europe as part of (its) European infrastructure consolidation review.\"\nRAF Mildenhall is used as a transport hub by the USAF and is home to air refuelling tankers and special operations forces.\nIt has about 3,200 military personnel, with 400-500 UK civilian staff employed there.\nBoth bases are in the Forest Heath District Council area.\nJames Waters, leader of the council, said: \"The USAF contributes significantly to the local economy so the expansion of RAF Lakenheath, and with it the US government's commitment to the site as part of its long term plans, is very welcome.\n\"But this happiness is obviously tempered by our sadness that Mildenhall is to close.\n\"Both announcements mean huge changes to the landscape of Forest Heath , but I am optimistic that with every change there are opportunities for reinvention, growth and investment.\"\nFor some years now the US military has been reviewing its bases in Europe, eager to reduce its footprint to rationalise and cut costs.\nIn part it is due to budget constraints but it is also driven by strategic changes as the Pentagon turns its gaze increasingly towards the Asia-Pacific.\nRAF Mildenhall has been an important base for the Americans since the early 1950s when it was home to strategic bombers.\nCurrently it houses US Air Force Special Forces and a fleet of air-to-air tankers.\nThe latter, though less glamorous than fast jets, are some of the most important elements of the USAF, described by one analyst as the \"kryptonite\" of modern air power.\nThey enable combat and support aircraft to reach their targets and to remain over combat zones for the time needed to carry out their missions.\nIt is likely that the KC-135 tankers from Mildenhall will move to a US base in Germany.\nBritish defence sources are eager to stress that the base closures here - two US-run communications stations at RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire are also to shut down  - do not represent any dilution of Washington's commitment to European security.\nIndeed RAF Lakenheath is due to host two squadrons of new F-35 aircraft when they enter service.\nOver recent months the Americans have deployed small but significant reinforcements to Europe to reassure NATO allies like Poland and the Baltic republics in the wake of Russia's actions against Ukraine.\nThe US had hundreds of tanks in Europe during Cold War but there was a brief moment after 2013 when all US tanks had been withdrawn from Europe.\nToday about a battalion's worth are back in Europe exercising with allies.\nBut the Pentagon has plans to store an armoured brigade's worth of equipment - some 150 tanks along with other armoured vehicles  - in Europe by 2015.\nRAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth are used as USAF communications bases, rather than for flying, and their operations were expected to move to RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire.\nThe USAF has about 750 military personnel at the two Cambridgeshire bases, with a further 1,500 civilian employees and dependents.\nJason Ablewhite, leader of Huntingdonshire District Council, said the news was \"hugely disappointing\" as both bases contributed about \u00a340m a year to the local economy.\nHe said it would mean the loss of 760 personnel and 1,500 civilian jobs, adding: \"The impact on the local economy could be considerable.\n\"However, the Enterprise Zone is on the same site as RAF Alconbury, and will provide thousands of jobs over the coming years.\"",

    "40814250": "Current drugs help manage the symptoms, but do not prevent brain cells dying.\nThe trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression of the disease.\nThe University College London (UCL) team is \"excited\", but it urges caution as any long-term benefit is uncertain and the drug needs more testing.\n\"There's absolutely no doubt the most important unmet need in Parkinson's is a drug to slow down disease progression, it's unarguable,\" Prof Tom Foltynie, one of the researchers, told the BBC.\nIn Parkinson's, the brain is progressively damaged and the cells that produce the hormone dopamine are lost.\nIt leads to a tremor, difficulty moving and eventually memory problems.\nTherapies help manage symptoms by boosting dopamine levels, but the death of the brain continues and the disease gets worse.\nNo drug stops that happening.\nIn the trial, half of patients were given the diabetes drug exenatide and the rest were given a placebo (dummy treatment). All the patients stayed on their usual medication.\nAs expected, those on just their usual medication declined over 48 weeks of treatment. But those given exenatide were stable.\nAnd three months after the experimental treatment stopped, those who had been taking exenatide were still better off.\nProf Foltynie told the BBC News website: \"This is the first clinical trial in actual patients with Parkinson's where there has been anything like this size of effect.\n\"It gives us confidence exenatide is not just masking symptoms, it's doing something to the underlying disease.\n\"We have to be excited and encouraged, but also cautious as we need to replicate these findings.\"\nThey also need to trial the drug for much longer periods of time.\nAn effective drug would need to hold back the disease for years in order to make a significant difference to patients.\nParkinson's progresses slowly and the difference in this 60-week trial was definitely there, but was \"trivial\" in terms of the impact on day-to-day life, say the researchers.\nThe drug helps control blood sugar levels in diabetes by acting on a hormone sensor called GLP-1.\nThose sensors are found in brain cells too. It is thought the drug makes those cells work more efficiently or helps them to survive.\nIt is why the drug is being tested in other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's.\nDavid Dexter, the deputy director of research at Parkinson's UK, said: \"The findings offer hope that drugs like exenatide can slow the course of Parkinson's - \u00e2\u20ac\u0160something no current treatment can do.\n\"Because Parkinson's can progress quite gradually, this study was probably too small and short to tell us whether exenatide can halt the progression of the condition, but it's certainly encouraging and warrants further investigation.\"\nDr Brian Fiske, from the The Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, said: \"The results from the exenatide studies justify continued testing, but clinicians and patients are urged not to add exenatide to their regimens until more is known about their safety and impact on Parkinson's.\"",

    "39815663": "After Brexit, that would obviously exclude London where the vast majority is currently done.\nThat has always been a major grievance for other European capitals who sense an opportunity to restart an old fight for a big prize.\nLondon's financial district - or \"The City\" - is like a coral reef. It has grown into a complex ecosystem over hundreds of years with lots of specialist organisms feeding off each other.\nThe coral is home to plants and anemones which in turn are home to fish, and crustacea of dazzling variety.\nBankers and traders may be the apex predators but there are lawyers, accountants, insurance brokers and tech workers swimming around them.\nIt's very hard to replicate but that doesn't mean it can't be damaged. If you chip a bit off - you lose a few of the resident clownfish too.\nThat rather extended metaphor is perhaps one way to think about the subject of euro clearing. It's a very basic, boring and yet incredibly important bit of the reef.\nClearing is the process by which a third party organisation acts as an intermediary for both buyer and seller.\nThey deal with the clearing \"house\" rather than each other which centralises everything and makes the whole complex business easier and quicker. 75% of all everything bought and sold in euros - anywhere in the world - is cleared in London - some 850 billion euros EVERY DAY.\nClearing houses also bear the risks that once side of the transaction doesn't cough up.\nIn return for that risk, buyers and sellers have to keep money in a special account with the clearing house in case there are problems. The more business you do with them, the less money proportionately of your trading volumes you need to keep in that account. Bigger clearing houses are therefore cheaper for their customers.\nIf you start chipping bits off the reef and carting them off to Europe those costs could rise. Some estimates put the cost of fragmenting this bit of the reef at an additional 77bn euros to the people that use them.\nIt would cost UK jobs too. An Ernst and Young study last year estimated that over 80,000 UK jobs would go if euro-clearing moved from London.\nOther financial centres have tried for years to steal this business. In fact, the European Central Bank in Frankfurt tried to insist that all euro trades in the EU were done inside the eurozone. A policy it had to scrap when the European Court of Justice ruled in 2015 it discriminated against non-eurozone countries who are part of the EU.\nIf that court case is run again once the UK is outside the EU, that defence no longer works.\nThis new raiding party is led by the EU Financial Services Commissioner Valdis Dombrovkis who is arguing that either the EU has greater policing powers over clearing in London (a cup of cold sick in political and regulatory terms) or, the business has to relocate to the EU (two cups).\nIt's not clear, however, that a defeat for London would be a victory for the EU. Some euro clearing also happens in the US and many think that the way firms will minimise the cost of disruption and fragmentation will be to do their business in New York - another big reef - which would only serve to weaken Europe as a whole in the global financial power league.\nThat is what Chancellor Philip Hammond was getting at when he warned that the UK and Europe \"should be careful of any proposals which might disrupt growth, raise the cost of investment in Europe and the UK or weaken financial stability\".\nNew York is watching closely on the sidelines as the battle for Britain's finance industry starts in earnest.",

That would have punished higher earners as well but not by as much as the Isa-style option.\nIt would also have encouraged saving for retirement by the less well off (20p taxpayers) by, in effect, giving a pound for every four they saved.\nMick McAteer, co-director of the Financial Inclusion Centre, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"very disappointed\" that the government had stepped away from tackling the \"clear inequality in our pension system\".\nDot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, Britain's biggest pensioner organisation, said: \"The chancellor has wasted a golden opportunity to not only reform the unfair system of pension tax relief, but at the same time solve the funding crisis in social care.\"\nConservative MP Mark Garnier, who sits on the Treasury select committee, acknowledged that the present system \"massively favours those people who are earning more money\" and told Today he favoured \"a fundamental rehash of the pension system\".\nHowever, he said a flat rate relief would have been \"quite difficult to administer\" and more thought should be given to what reforms would work best.\nMr McDonnell said the chancellor was \"putting the interests of his party ahead of those of our country\".\n\"The big test for this Budget is whether it can start to lay the secure foundations for the economy of the future. This decision suggests George Osborne is only interested in securing the future leadership of his party.\"\nFormer Liberal Democrat pensions minister Steve Webb, who now works in the pensions industry, said Mr Osborne had been right to resist changes.\nHe called for a \"period of stability\" in pensions policy in the interest of encouraging people to save for the long term.\nSavers pay no tax on money they put into a pension but they do pay tax on what they take out each year beyond the personal allowance.\nThe government also allows pensioners to withdraw 25% of their pot tax free as a lump sum.\nThe way the relief works is that some of a person's earnings that would have been taken by government in tax can be contributed to their pension instead.\nPension savers receive tax relief at the highest rate of income tax they pay.\nThis means that the cost of a \u00a310,000 pension contribution would, in effect, be \u00a38,000 for a basic rate taxpayer because otherwise \u00a32,000 would have gone in tax. For a 40% taxpayer the saving would be \u00a34,000, and \u00a34,500 for those at the 45% rate. So present arrangements favour the better off.\nThe amount anyone can save into a pension and receive tax relief on is capped at \u00a340,000 annually and \u00a31.25m in their lifetime.\nMr Osborne was warned ahead of the Budget that introducing Isa-style arrangements could prompt a mass withdrawal from pension funds.\nConservative MPs had also become concerned about the impact on their constituents of any move to flat rate relief, which would have reduced breaks for higher rate taxpayers.\nBBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said Mr Osborne's decision was also a recognition of how fragile the EU referendum campaign is and removed the risk of upsetting voters ahead of the vote on 23 June.\nAn ally of the chancellor told the Times that Mr Osborne did not want to put people off saving. \"Now isn't the right time, with uncertainty in the global economy and reforms such as auto-enrolment still bedding in, to turn things on their head.\nThe prospect of radical reform had also been opposed by the pensions industry.\nChanges to the pensions system in recent years have included automatic enrolment into workplace pensions in 2012, and people aged 55 and over being allowed to take their retirement pots how they want rather than being required to buy an annuity retirement income - introduced in 2015.",

At 5ft 10in and 14 stone, the 34-year-old plays an old-fashioned way: finding space where others seek contact, appearing unhurried when fly-halves have never had less time, still managing to play on instinct when set moves and patterns are everywhere you look.\nIt's not that Carter doesn't do the nasty stuff. In Racing's semi-final win over Leicester Tigers he made 16 tackles.\nIt's how he does it. Whereas Jonny Wilkinson, the original big-hitting number 10, stopped opposition runners like a rogue flanker and brought gasps from the stands and lungs of the victim alike, Carter tackles like he does everything else - with economy rather than anger, with perfect yet undemonstrative technique, with efficiency over ostentation.\nCarter is not quite the player he was. The outside break and sudden acceleration that defined so many of his early masterclasses have quietly been lost to the years. It doesn't really matter. In his swansong he appears to worry less about what he lacks than utilise what he does.\nIf it wasn't the sort of thing that in his home town of Southbridge would trigger disbelief - expressed, because this is the South Island of New Zealand, by something as flamboyant as a raised eyebrow or muted cough - you'd say it was all rather Zen: the impossible calm in a sporting storm, the balance between self and team, equanimity in even the biggest occasions.\nThere is the ritual of his relentless kicking practice, whether at the posts that his father put up next to the family home or on the foreign fields of France; the meditation brought about by those repeated simple actions; the carefully constructed humility of an All Blacks environment where 100-cap heroes like Carter and retired captain Richie McCaw were expected to clean up the dressing room like backroom juniors.\nAnd it is all done in the most unobtrusive way. Wilkinson kicked from the tee with such exaggerated movements that half-cut punters in pubs could do impressions. Dan Biggar has his little soft-shoe shuffle, the 'Biggarena'. Owen Farrell, Carter's opposite number on Saturday, has the laser eyes and robotic head-turn.\nCarter? Even after so many penalties and conversions, it's still hard to remember exactly how he looks in sweet motion. The fact that he has been the same with ball in hand - perfectly timed passes or offloads, but all done in the most discreet and understated way - have sometimes made it hard for people to understand what has made him so special. He doesn't always stand out, so how can he be outstanding?\n\"He's fascinating,\" admits Ronan O'Gara, arguably Ireland's finest fly-half and now, in early retirement, assistant coach at Carter's Racing.\n\"He's just extremely humble, extremely respectful. He smiles, he always finds a way of getting the job done.\n\"He doesn't stress, he's always polite, he's a breath of fresh air. You can learn an awful lot by just watching him.\"\nCarter isn't the only sporting great who can appear to be operating in slow-motion and fast-forward at the same time, but he maintains that composure longer than most.\nTennis' Roger Federer at his best was both unhurried and unflustered, but at the moment of victory all that held-back emotion would come crashing out. In cricket, Chris Gayle remains expressionless when thrashing unfortunate bowlers for six after six, but will dance with his top off when victory has been won.\nLionel Messi, for all the gossamer touches with that left foot, is all beautiful bustle and obvious energy, Cristiano Ronaldo all strut and preen on the football pitch.\nEven Tiger Woods, who before his fall could hold his form and nerve in the final-round meltdown like no other golfer, would spit and cuss his way round the course when the mojo left his side.\nCarter, in the biggest moments he has faced, has looked as perturbed as if he were back at Christchurch Boys' High School, from the second Test against the Lions in 2005, when he turned in a performance that led to him being described as \"the perfect 10\", all the way through to last October's World Cup final.\nAgainst the Wallabies at Twickenham that day, there was a moment to epitomise so much of what had come before: the All Blacks suddenly under huge pressure, their 17-point lead cut to just four with 15 minutes to go.\nIn his first 110 Tests Carter had landed a total of just six drop-goals. A week after adding another to put away South Africa in the semi-finals, he took a pass flat with the defence charging, his feet and eyes set for the short pass to Sonny Bill Williams on his outside shoulder.\nForty metres out, the game's greatest prize in the balance, chaos all around. Not for Carter. Instead, a little pocket of space and tranquillity and time where no-one else could see it, a turn of the shoulders and hips, a perfect contact with his left boot to send the ball arcing between the sticks.\nWilkinson was also touched by Eastern philosophy, first by Buddhism as cruel injuries kept keeping him out, later by a Japanese school of thought called Kaizen.\nBecause of the man that Wilkinson is, that was more about a tortured form of self-improvement. \"You imagine being watched by a video 24/7 to help you get better each day and make good decisions,\" he has said.\nFor Farrell, who shares much of Wilkinson's dedication, Saturday is also about a particular kind of personal development.\nAfter his yellow card in the critical World Cup group match against Australia and the two-week ban for a dangerous tackle after Saracens' Champions Cup semi-final win over Wasps, he will be watching Carter not just to keep his influence in check but to learn from the old master too.\n\"It's just how calm he is, how much he is in control of what he does that stands out,\" the fiery Farrell says.\n\"Trying to be calmer on the pitch, it's definitely something I'm always trying to do. The more you're calm, the more you're in control and the more you're thinking about the right things.\"\nCarter in control. The career moves on, but the philosophy remains the same.\nFor the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.",

This will allow us to educate those using and those thinking of trying it for the first time that extremely serious consequences are attached with this drug.\n\"My experience with those addicted to Spice is that they can be very volatile and present with mental health issues, often without mental health being an issue prior to using Spice.\n\"The fact of the matter is that more and more addicts are dying and the addiction problem continues to rise.

    "34037168": "But the \"You Stink\" campaign said the decision did not mean it was giving up.\nThe move comes after two days of demonstrations in the capital descended into clashes in which dozens of protesters and police were hurt.\nPrime Minister Tammam Salam has appealed for calm and threatened to resign over the crisis.\nIn a televised address on Sunday, he warned that Lebanon was heading towards collapse, with the country's \"political garbage\" crippling his unity cabinet.\nThousands of people gathered outside the prime minister's office in central Beirut on Sunday to protest against the government's failure to have the large piles of rubbish which have been building up in the capital for weeks removed.\nChanting \"the people want the downfall of the regime\", some protesters threw rocks and sticks at riot police and lit fires. Officers responded by firing water cannon and tear gas.\nThe clashes left at least 44 demonstrators and 30 police officers injured, officials said. Dozens of people were also injured on Saturday, when police fired rubber bullets.\nLike the issue of electricity in Iraq, the failure of a public utility in Lebanon - rubbish collection - has brought to a head simmering, chronic public indignation over a deadlocked political system riddled with corruption, inefficiency and sectarianism.\nAs the embattled Prime Minister Tammam Salam pointed out, it is this issue that threw the spotlight on the \"political rubbish\" that is the real problem - one that has paralysed his own cabinet and the twice-prorogued parliament from taking effective decisions on any issue.\nBehind the political stagnation is the unbending stand-off between the two major political blocs, divided primarily over attitudes to the Syrian regime - the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its mainly Shia allies on one side, and the Saudi-backed, mainly Sunni pro-Western 14 March movement.\nMr Salam's warning of an imminent collapse should be a wake-up call to those blocs that it is time to collaborate on solutions, not least to the 15-month vacancy at the country's presidency. That seems unlikely, with regional struggles as unresolved as they are.\nProtesters are also broadening their demands to include an end to the pervasive sectarian political system, something that is even harder to imagine.\nBut public pressure is mounting.

He was completely at ease saluting families, kissing babies and tenderly embracing a young disabled man, as the Pope was driven in an open jeep around the packed square.\nPope Francis also speaks when he remains silent.\nPope Francis, formerly Buenos Aires Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio, was elected on 13 March, becoming the first non-European pope for almost 1,300 years.\nHe replaced Benedict XVI, who held the office for eight years and became the first pontiff in more than 700 years to resign, saying he no longer had the physical strength to continue.\nIn his Urbi et Orbi (To the city and the world) speech, Pope Francis began with a simple \"Happy Easter!\"\nThe 76-year-old Pope, who has begun his tenure by emphasising humility, went on: \"Christ has risen! What a joy it is for me to announce this message... I would like it to go out to every house and every family, especially where the suffering is greatest, in hospitals, in prisons.\"\nLater in his speech, Pope Francis said: \"We ask the risen Jesus, who turns death into life, to change hatred into love, vengeance into forgiveness, war into peace.\"\nThe Pope then mentioned troubled regions of the world in turn.\nIn pictures: Easter festivities\n\"Peace for the Middle East, and particularly between Israelis and Palestinians, who struggle to find the road of agreement, that they may willingly and courageously resume negotiations to end a conflict that has lasted all too long.\n\"Peace in Iraq, that every act of violence may end, and above all for dear Syria, for its people torn by conflict and for the many refugees who await help and comfort.\"\nFor Africa, the Pope referred to Mali, Nigeria - \"where attacks sadly continue\" - the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.\nHe added: \"Peace in Asia, above all on the Korean peninsula: may disagreements be overcome and a  renewed spirit of reconciliation grow.\"\nProfile: Pope Francis\nPope Francis concluded by saying: \"Peace in the whole world, still divided by greed looking for easy gain, wounded by the selfishness which threatens human life and the family, selfishness that continues in human trafficking, the most extensive form of slavery in this 21st Century.\"\nBBC Rome correspondent, Alan Johnston, says the Pope has reinforced his image as a man of simple, down-to-earth tastes, not wearing the more ostentatious of papal costumes and, for the moment, not moving into the grandiose papal apartments.\nOne pilgrim in Rome on Sunday, Briton Tina Hughes, said that Francis represented a \"new beginning\".\n\"I think he brings something special. He connects with people.

Its aim has been to overthrow the government through guerrilla warfare.

Dylan has to keep his arms down but he's being held and I don't think there is any malice in it. The nature of the game didn't justify a red card. I think Smith went down pretty easily, which was disappointing.\n\"I think the referee's initial decision of a yellow card would have been the correct decision.\n\"I thought Luther Burrell was outstanding. After 20 minutes we said we were still going to take them on and what we needed from Luther was to stay strong and on his feet and he did that brilliantly.\"\nLeicester Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill:\n\"I'm frustrated with how we managed that second half. We got what we deserved. You have to control that field position and get that forward pack into the right areas of the field so we can have opportunities to create attacks.\n\"We were defensively poor. We were too narrow.

In addition, September's survey indicated that new business in services rose at the fastest pace since February and that the rate of job creation had picked up.\nHowever, Mr Williamson pointed out that the pace of expansion had cooled since the beginning of the year, \"reflecting widespread concern about the potential future impact of Brexit\".\nOfficial growth figures for the second quarter were revised up to 0.7% last week, by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), from an initial reading of 0.6%.\nPantheon Economics agreed that the Bank of England would probably refrain from cutting rates in November but predicted growth would continue to slow in the coming months, \"as firms hold back from hiring and investment due to 'hard' Brexit risk and households' real incomes are squeezed by rising inflation\".\nThe PMI survey showed that services firms reported the fastest rate of input price inflation since February 2013 in September, with providers subsequently raising their charges at the fastest rate since January 2014.\nThe services industry - which includes everything from financial advice to retailers - accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy.",

So when things go wrong I fully understand the dissatisfaction of passengers and the inconvenience that is caused.\n\"Although there are no guarantees major failures won't happen, I give my reassurance that ScotRail has learned lessons and is far better prepared for contingencies, including communication with passengers, when such incidents do take place.\"\nHe added: \"I know about the work that is required and the service that is to be delivered.

    "24478245": "Scientists believe kissing helps people judge the quality of a potential mate through taste, smell and fitness.\nOnce in a relationship, the Oxford University study found kissing was a way of getting a partner to stick around.\nWomen were found to value kissing more highly in long-term relationships.\nAn online survey of 900 adults by the Oxford team, published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behaviour, showed that men and women who were more attractive or had more casual sex partners were more selective in choosing mates, and those groups valued kissing more highly.\nThis suggests that kissing helps in sizing up a potential partner, the study says.\nProfessor Robin Dunbar, from the department of experimental psychology at Oxford University, said courtship in humans was complex and involved a whole series of assessments before men and women decided to carry on their relationship.\n\"Initial attraction may include facial, body and social cues. Then assessments become more and more intimate as we go deeper into the courtship stages, and this is where kissing comes in.\n\"In choosing partners, we have to deal with the 'Jane Austen problem': How long do you wait for Mr Darcy to come along when you can't wait forever and there may be lots of you waiting just for him? At what point do you have to compromise for the curate?\"\nProf Dunbar said that Jane Austen, whose works of romantic fiction included Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, realised that people were extremely good at assessing where they were in the \"mating market\" and pitching their demands accordingly.\n\"It depends what kind of poker hand you've been dealt.\n\"If you have a strong bidding hand, you can afford to be much more demanding and choosy when it comes to prospective mates,\" he said,\nIf kissing plays a part in selecting a partner then it also plays an important role before sex in short relationships and at a range of different times in committed relationships, the study found.\nThe study found that kissing was particularly important to women in long-term relationships.\nThis may be because it plays a role in increasing feelings of affection and attachment among couples, the researchers suggest.\nPrevious research had found that women placed greater value on activities that strengthen long-term relationships because being pregnant and raising children is easier when two parents are present.\nIn another study in Human Nature, researchers from Oxford suggest that women's attitude to romantic kissing also depends on where in their menstrual cycle and their relationship they are.\nWomen valued kissing most at the start of a relationship and around the time they were most likely to conceive in their cycle.",

    "34078819": "The electrostatic coating allows the netting to carry much higher doses of insecticide.\nIn experiments, the coating killed off many more mosquitoes than usual.\nDutch researchers, writing in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, say this could help control diseases such as malaria.\nInsecticide resistance in mosquitoes has become a significant problem in many parts of the world where malaria is endemic.\nIt is thought that water-based spray insecticides and bed nets, which often contain low levels of insecticide, don't always kill the mosquitoes, allowing them to develop resistance.\nIn this study, researchers from the Netherlands used a charged surface, originally developed for trapping airborne pollen, and applied insecticide to it.\nThe long-lasting electrostatic charge allowed high levels of insecticide to stick fast to the netting, giving the mosquitoes a lethal overdose when they came into contact with the surface - even for just a few seconds.\nThe technique was tested on different strains of mosquito in South Africa, Tanzania and at a lab at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.\nThe research team found that the electrostatic coating of insecticide killed more mosquitoes than other nettings and, for certain insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, was 100% effective.\nConventional nettings kill fewer than 10% of mosquitoes, the study said.\nMarit Farenhorst, who led the research, from In2Care at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, said the coating could be used on screens on windows and doors around the home, on curtains and walls, and in mosquito traps and wall ventilation tubes in homes.\n\"It's a new way of trying to target and contaminate mosquitoes,\" she said.\nShe also said the new method would be suitable for a number of different types of chemical insecticide.\nHowever, she said the coating was probably not suitable for bed nets because people regularly touch and wash them so the insecticide would come off over time.",
    "39523865": "It could see Spotify register shares on a stock exchange and become a publicly listed company without raising new cash, the Wall Street Journal reported.\nShares would be traded on the day of listing, with the price based on supply and demand, rather than new investors buying shares the day before trading.\nSpotify declined to comment.\nA direct listing would save the music service the underwriting fees needed to launch an initial public offering (IPO), and would avoid diluting the value of existing stakes in the company.\nIt could also sidestep a surge in first-day trading that often takes place after an IPO, which can signal that a company undervalued its newly issued shares.\nThe tactic, though rare, is usually used by smaller companies that do not expect high levels of trading in their stock.\nA direct listing of a company is \"basically just sticking it on eBay\", says CMC Markets senior market analyst Michael Hewson.\nWhereas with an IPO new investors can buy shares from existing investors the day before trading begins, with a direct listing investors buy shares on the open market on the day they are listed for the going rate.\nVery rare. \"No-one does it,\" says Mr Hewson. Normally firms use an IPO as an opportunity to make lots of cash.\nIn general, IPOs can also cost a fair chunk of money, and, crucially for Spotify, they can take a lot of time to set up.\nAn IPO needs an investment bank or banks to underwrite an issue of new stock. Underwriting often amounts to the bank buying new stock to resell after the company floats.\nThe bank also looks at the company as part of the process for setting a reasonable initial offer price for the shares. The underwriters \"build a book\" - that is, they go to institutional investors to gauge the appetite for the shares in the company that's going to be floated. Fund managers say how many shares they want and the price they would be willing to pay, and the level of this demand is one of the factors used to set the initial offer price.\nAll of this to-ing and fro-ing eats up cash and time - and for Spotify, the clock is ticking.\nIn March last year, the firm raised $1bn from investors at an interest rate of 5% a year, plus a discount of 20% on shares once they list.\nBut under the terms of the agreement, the interest rate goes up by one percentage point and the discount by 2.5 percentage points every six months until the shares are listed.\nSo as time ticks by, Spotify has to pay more to its creditors, and give them more of a discount on shares.\nAs well as being a faster process, direct listing also means fewer regulatory hurdles, and it helps keeps expectations about share prices in check.\nSpotify, which last year issued a $1bn (\u00c2\u00a3801m) convertible bond, was publicly valued at $8.5bn (\u00c2\u00a36.8bn) in 2015.\nThe Swedish firm was founded more than a decade ago and now has more than 50 million paying subscribers.\nThis week it also signed a new long-term licensing deal with Universal Music Group, the world's largest record label.\nSpotify includes TPG and Goldman Sachs among its major investors.",

Both men reiterated calls for all sides to observe the cessation of hostilities, the Russian foreign ministry said.\nMr de Mistura is due to travel to Russia on Tuesday.\nMr Kerry's trip to Geneva was hastily arranged after Mr de Mistura appealed to the US and Russia, which back opposing sides in Syria's five-year conflict, to rescue the cessation of hostilities they brokered in February.\nAt the start of a meeting with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir on Monday, Mr Kerry said he would press rebel groups in Aleppo to separate themselves from the powerful jihadist group, al-Nusra Front.\n\"This is what we're discussing, among other things. There are a number of different ways to approach it,\" Mr Kerry told reporters.\n\"We're getting closer to a place of understanding. But we have some work to do.\"\nThe Syrian government and Russia have said the Aleppo air strikes are targeting only al-Nusra, which is affiliated to al-Qaeda and is excluded from the cessation of hostilities along with the rival Islamic State group.\nHowever, the opposition and the US have dismissed the claim, and accused the government of targeting civilians and rebels abiding by the cessation of hostilities.\n\"What is happening in Aleppo is an outrage. It's a violation of all humanitarian laws. It's a crime,\" Mr Jubeir said, adding that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would be held accountable and would be removed from power either through a political process or by force.\nThe fighting in Aleppo has also seen dozens of civilians killed in rebel artillery attacks on government-held areas.\nAfter at least 50 people were killed in a reported government air strike on a hospital last Wednesday night, the International Committee of the Red Cross warned that Aleppo was being \"pushed further to the brink of humanitarian disaster\".\nLarge parts of the city have been destroyed and its infrastructure has been severely damaged, leaving civilians without water and electricity for months.\nThe talks in Geneva come a day after the Syrian military extended a \"regime of calm\" around the capital, Damascus, for another 24 hours.\nThe unilateral truce also covers the northern countryside of the coastal province of Latakia,\nMore than three dozen rebel factions said on Saturday that they would not respect the truce, unless the government agreed to extend it over the whole country.",

    "36128318": "Mrs May said the convention, which is separate from the EU, \"can bind the hands of Parliament\".\nDavid Cameron has previously refused to rule out leaving the convention.\nEx-cabinet minister and Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith said her \"remarkable intervention\" had \"utterly undermined\" the government's position.\nIn her first major speech of the referendum campaign, Mrs May said the UK had to \"stand tall and lead in Europe\" rather than leaving the EU, and that membership made the UK  \"more secure from crime and terrorism\".\nShe also raised concerns about more countries joining the EU.\nThe ECHR, which is separate from the EU institutions, was incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act.\nThe Conservatives have pledged to replace the Human Rights Act with a \"British Bill of Rights\" but have not proposed leaving the convention altogether.\nBBC political editor\nThe home secretary is one of the most senior politicians in the country. Of course, her backing of the Remain campaign is important. And it's certainly better for the prime minister and the Remain campaign to have her In, rather than Out.\nBut her qualified support suggests there are three, rather than two, positions at the top of the Conservative party - 'Remain', 'Leave', and perhaps now, 'Reluctant Remain'.\nIt was the Out campaign struggling to contain their internal differences. Tonight, it feels like cracks might appear on the other side too.\nRead more from Laura\nA Downing Street spokeswoman urged journalists not to \"overdo the differences\" between the prime minister and the home secretary on withdrawal from the ECHR.\nShe said Mr Cameron \"rules nothing out\" as he seeks reform of the convention, saying the home secretary had been \"setting out a clear distinction between the ECHR and the EU\".\nRegardless of the outcome of the 23 June EU referendum, Mrs May said she still believed the UK should leave the ECHR which she said \"adds nothing to our prosperity\".\nIt was the ECHR, not the EU, that was responsible for controversial human rights decision affecting the UK, she said.\nEarlier pro-Leave Justice Secretary Michael Gove  warned that five potential new members of the EU - Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Albania and Turkey - would result in millions more people having the right to move to the UK.\nMrs May said Albania, Serbia and Turkey had \"poor populations and serious problems with organised crime, corruption, and sometimes even terrorism\".\nShe added: \"We have to ask ourselves, is it really right that the EU should just continue to expand, conferring upon all new member states all the rights of membership?\"\nShe said the UK had \"forgotten how to lead\" in Europe and must re-assert itself to force change from within, adding that it could veto Turkey joining the EU.\nIn her speech - and during a question and answer session - Mrs May admitted that being in the EU made it harder to control the \"volume of immigration\". But she said the UK was able to control its border by blocking entry to terrorists.\nShe praised David Cameron's leadership in trying to seek a better deal for the UK, but said the UK's collective posture was too often to \"blame Europe\" for its problems and the UK \"has to have more confidence to get things done\" rather than \"shouting from the sidelines\".\nMrs May said the issue the British public faced on 23 June was how the UK \"maximised\" its \"prosperity, security, influence and sovereignty\".\nIn what she said was an analysis of \"the risks and opportunities\" of EU membership rather than an attack on Leave campaigners, she said the post-war order had seen the UK and other countries \"cede sovereignty in a controlled way\" by co-operating to prevent a greater loss of sovereignty through military conflict or economic decline.\nMrs May said the question was not whether the UK could \"survive\" outside the EU given that it was the world's fifth largest economy which had \"friendships and alliances across the world\" - but whether the UK was \"better off in or out\".\nWhile \"the sky would not fall\" in the event of Brexit, she said she had concluded it was a matter of \"hard-headed national interest\" to remain in, based on security, trade and prosperity.\nOn security, she said EU membership enabled the UK to access EU-wide information, such as criminal records, to allow the UK to turn away serious criminals and terrorists at the border, fast-track the extradition of offenders and simplify the deportation of prisoners.\nThe UK had extensive intelligence-sharing with the US and other allies outside the EU, she said but being excluded from the EU-wide information sharing would make the UK \"less safe\".\nHowever, she called for major changes to the way the UK did business in the EU, including reducing the power of the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice.\nMr Duncan Smith told the BBC the home secretary's comments on the ECHR and EU expansion had \"thrown the gauntlet down\" to the government.\nOn EU expansion, he claimed, the prime minister is \"in favour of extending our borders to Syria\" by allowing Turkey to join the EU.\n\"She actually basically questions the very campaign she says that she supports,\" he said.\n\"This is a remarkable intervention. She has really thrown the gauntlet down and undermines the whole of the 'vote stay in' campaign.\"\nMr Duncan Smith said immigration was \"out of control\" and free movement of people rules meant the UK had to accept criminals coming into the country.\n\"An elected government in the UK elected on a platform to reduce immigration right now cannot deliver that because the EU is an open border,\" he told Radio 4's Today.\n\"You cannot reject anyone unless you can demonstrate categorically that they pose an immediate threat to the life and livelihood of the UK.\"",

When I'm there I just can't wait to get into the snooker hall.\"\nLuckily for Page, his teachers recognise his potential and are happy for him to forego as many lessons as is necessary for him to pursue his snooker ambitions.\nAfter a week in school, Page will travel to Cyprus for the European Championships, where winning the under-21 or senior competition would give him the opportunity to turn professional.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWith Page in Cyprus will be his mother Clare, who along with father Andrew, has been integral to his snooker development.\nBeing the parents of a budding player has meant driving him from school to the local snooker hall every day, then for a whole day of practice on Saturdays and usually a tournament on Sundays - of which Page enters about 33 a year.\n\"We're so proud, we just can't believe it,\" says Clare.\n\"We came down here with no expectation. He did, he had expectation because he's got all the confidence in the world.\n\"We were just thinking we've got a couple of days off work, we'll come down with him, and my head was mostly down because I couldn't watch.\"\nAndrew was the first person Jackson saw as he left the table after his first and second-round wins, and he begins to well up as he reflects on his son's achievement.\n\"It's emotional. Even seeing him walk out on the big stage, you get a lump in your throat,\" says Andrew, his eyes glistening as he struggles to restrain his tears.\n\"When that last black went in - I don't know if it was the first round or the second, I can't remember - I was the first one out of there, before anyone could see me crying.\"\nThe pride, warmth and sheer enthusiasm with which Page's parents speak is infectious. They joke that it is just as well they have only one son - as they would simply not have the time to support another child as lovingly or committedly.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nPage, while equally amenable and friendly, is more reserved. His is a temperament made for professional sport.\nPerhaps it is a quality he has gleaned from two-time world champion Mark Williams, who is from Cwm - just a couple of miles away from Ebbw Vale - and has been helping Page train.\n\"He's very laid back, which is a good trait to have,\" Page says. \"I've played with Mark on the practice tables a few times. You learn off him and get tips off him.\"\nWilliams, a former world number one with 18 ranking titles and about \u00a35m in prize money to his name, will be a valuable influence as Page aims to establish himself.\nThe financial rewards for leading snooker players can be great and, this week, Page got a taste of things which might be to come.\nReaching the third round of the Welsh Open earned him \u00a33,500 - a far cry from the pocket money or paper rounds with which most 15-year-olds have to make do.\nTrue to form, the measured Page plans to put the majority of that sum in the bank. Surely, though, after such a remarkable week, he can afford himself a little treat?\nHe ponders his options, smiles and says: \"I might get a McDonalds later.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFormer world champion Terry Griffiths\n\"When I saw Jackson play, it reminded me of when I was 15 years of age and how I thought about playing. He just loves to be there.\n\"He takes on shots that other people turn down because he's excited at that age and to win two matches as he has done is exceptional.\n\"He's a tremendous potter, he's got no fear at all.\"\nFormer world champion Mark Williams\n\"He's played a few pros already and beaten them. I didn't do that when I was 15. What he is doing is incredible.\n\"He is a very fast player, he will slow down when he's older, but he is only 15. He keeps winning under-21 tournaments, so he doesn't need to change too much.\"\nDeputy phase director of Ebbw Fawr Learning Community, Paul Freeguard\n\"We are very, very proud of his achievement, but not surprised, as he is an under-18 world champion.\n\"The other pupils are following the tournament, they are all avid fans now. They are getting time to catch up and watch him.\n\"He will have exams when he comes back, same as everyone else, so he will be expected to catch up on the work he has missed.\n\"Jackson will make a professional career out of snooker so it would be unfair if we hadn't supported him. But I couldn't tell you why he doesn't like history or English, but luckily he's doing well in those subjects.\n\"He will get a hero's welcome when he returns to the school.\"",

And just like her chart career, her marriage to Carl Dean turned 50 this year.\n\"I thought, well, this would be a good year to write an album of love songs,\" she says. \"I've never done that before. I've usually had a story song or a gospel song, but this was all love stories.\"\nThe BBC caught up with the star to discuss the new record, her legendary Glastonbury set, and why she admires Adele.\nFirst of all, congratulations on celebrating your golden wedding anniversary!\nThank you so much. That's a long time to do anything, ain't it? Especially to be married.\nWhat's the secret?\nWe've always been good buddies. We have a lot of fun and a lot of respect for one another. It was his first marriage and mine and we never thought we'd ever want to do that again. Why bother?\nYou renewed your vows earlier this year. What was that like?\nThat was sweet. There was no pressure at all. We had our own little ceremony in a little chapel on our property, then we went in our little RV down to Ringgold, Georgia, and spent the night where we had married 50 years before. We took some beautiful pictures and got all dressed up. It was fun really.\nDid you wear your original wedding dress? Could you still fit into it?\nWell, I could but I don't know where it is now! I only had a simple little white dress that my mother had made for me for that wedding, but I had always wanted a beautiful, long, beaded wedding gown, so I dressed completely to the nines. I made a right nice bride!\nThat sense of romance permeates your new album.\nOh yes! In fact a lot of the songs were written just because of that.\nYou've written so many love songs over the years - how do you find new ways to talk about it?\nLove is always growing, and we grow as people as well, so you just automatically take on new twists and turns. And it's amazing. I've always been amazed by that myself, how people can just write, year in and year out, about love and it all is different. I could write one right now!\nHow often do you write?\nI write something almost every single day unless I'm sick or on a movie set.\nIs that ever an inconvenience? Do you ever find yourself going, \"I don't have time to write a song right now, I need to finish this casserole?\"\nWell, no! In fact, I write a lot when I cook. If my cooking's really good that day, my songs are really good.\nIn Head Over High Heels, you sing about \"painting my eyes like Adele.\" What made you write about her?\nEveryone loves Adele. With all my little nieces, it's all \"Adele this\" and \"Adele that!\" And I love how she does her make-up, and so I'm always saying to my little nieces, \"can you fix my eyes like Adele?\"\nWhen I started that song, I had not planned to write that line. I was just thinking, \"This needs to be about a girl dressing up sexy, so she's got to have some make-up, and she's got to paint her eyes\". And all of a sudden it's like, \"And my eyes like Adele!\"\nWhat do you think her reaction will be?\nI think she'll have to be complimented, just like I'm always complimented when people write songs about me!\nI just meant I wanted to look like Adele. I hope she thinks it's cute.\nYou both like to talk to your audience in between songs, but she swears a lot more than you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I wondered what you made of that?\nOh, I don't pay any attention to that! Words are just an exchange, like money. I don't think the Lord holds that against us. I think that's just the way we communicate. And some people are just born cussers.\nWhat's the worst thing you've ever said on stage?\nOh, I've never said anything real bad. I try to respect the audience.\nThe song I'm 16 is based on one of your sisters, is that right?\nYeah, she had a couple of bad relationships and she thought it wasn't meant for her to have true love. Then all of a sudden, in her 60s, she met someone and they fell in love, and it's just like they were born again. It's just the sweetest thing.\nAnother one of my sisters and I were laughing. We said, \"Look at her, she thinks she's 16!\" and all of a sudden I heard the song in my head.\nGoes to show you're never old unless you choose to be.\nWhat age do you think of yourself as?\nI'm 16 in some ways. I'm still a hopeless romantic! But I'm 35 in my spirit and in my mind. When I was 35, it was a pinnacle, a great time in my life - success and happiness and all that. And so I just decided \"I'm gonna claim that number and always be that in my state of mind.\"\nWhat inspired Can't Be That Wrong?\nThat was an easy one to write. I think it's the ultimate cheating song.\nI based it on someone very, very close to me, who was very much in love with the person at home, and their children, and they weren't looking for love, they just happened to fall for someone. They were so torn, because they loved both people. I saw the turmoil and the heartache, and how overwhelming and overpowering it was. And I just thought, \"That's a strong-ass love, right there\". You know, to be willing to go through all you have to, and put the other people through that. So I thought, \"wow, this would make a great song.\"\nThe last time I saw you on stage in the UK was at Glastonbury - and you've put that concert on this album as a bonus disc. What are your memories of it?\nThat'll be one of my greatest memories, actually. That'll be a real highlight in my career.\nI wasn't even certain about doing that show, because I didn't know if I was the type of artist that would fit in that type of a festival - because people are rowdy, they like to go dancing, and they like to drink and smoke and I thought, \"I wonder if they're even going to pay attention?\"\nAnd so, as soon as I went out and I saw the crowd and heard the roar, I thought, \"Ohhhh, my Lord, how did I miss this all these years?\"\nThey call that part of the day the \"legends slot\". If you were booking next year's Glastonbury, who would you put in there?\nI don't know. I hadn't even thought about it in those terms. Probably Adele.\nBut I'm not sure I'd do it again, because I don't know how I could ever top that.\nPure and Simple is out now on RCA Records.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

    "32530125": "They are looking for chains of depressions known as catenae.\nThese would have formed when comets passed too close to the Sun and broke apart under tidal forces into many pieces, and then splattered the surface of the Solar System's innermost world.\nThe Open University team is examining pictures returned from the US space agency's (Nasa) Messenger probe.\nThis satellite, which is expected to end operations on Thursday with a crash of its own on to Mercury, has already revealed some extraordinary insights into the planet's past relationship with comets.\nMany of the ices and other volatile compounds seen in permanently shadowed craters at the poles were most probably delivered by the frozen wanderers.\nLikewise, the blackened hue of some surface deposits may indicate a dusting of carbon-rich material derived from comets that have hit Mercury.\nGiven its position so close to the Sun, one would expect the planet to have been pelted by the countless icy dirt-balls that routinely get drawn in to graze our star.\nAnd tidally fragmented comets would have done so as a train of objects, having been dislocated in the Sun's immense gravity field.\nSomething very similar is seen out at Jupiter where comets that have got too close to the gas giant will crumble and then sequentially splatter its moons.\nDavid Rothery and Emma Fegan have been poring over Messenger images, trying to determine how many of the 500 or so crater chains they have identified on Mercury are evidence of this same process of tidal disruption.\nMany of the catenae are unarguably the result of debris that was flung out of primary impact bowls (dug out by intact colliding comets or asteroids).  These ejecta strings form radial patterns that can be traced back to an obvious source.\nThe chains Rothery and Fegan are attempting to distinguish, on the other hand, have no clear origin. They appear isolated.\nAnd, intriguingly, when they plot the orientation of these suspect catenae, they appear to betray a bias. More seem to point north-south than east-west. If confirmed, this may say something about the early population of comets in the Solar System.\n\"It could be that we're seeing the north-south ones more easily because of the direction of sunlight, but these are pretty big features - kind of hard to miss,\" explained Prof Rothery.\n\"If there are genuinely more catenae orientated north-south than east-west, it's suggesting that if they're produced by tidally disrupted comets then the comets that were hitting Mercury more than three billion years ago had orbits tilted at more or less ninety degrees to the plane of Mercury's orbit.\"\nThe idea is somewhat speculative at the moment, but fascinating nonetheless.\nAlthough the image stream from Messenger is about to end, the next probe to Mercury is already under construction.\nBepiColombo is a joint venture between the European and Japanese space agencies.\nIts mission will launch in 2017 and arrive in orbit in 2024. Prof Rothery is the lead co-investigator on Bepi's Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (MIXS), which has been designed by a team at Leicester University.\nHe presented his and Fegan's catenae research at the recent European Geosciences Union General Assembly in Vienna, Austria.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

That is the rallying cry of the French National Front (FN) and some other populist parties.\nMigration and terrorism are also treated as separate issues because - as pointed out by EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - many asylum-seekers are themselves fleeing from the terror inflicted by Islamic State (IS), the Taliban and other extremist groups.\nThe dilemma for the EU is that Schengen - the passport-free area embracing 26 countries - greatly eases the flow of people and goods across the EU, but also requires more information-sharing, to prevent cross-border criminality.\nAbout 1.7 million EU citizens cross borders daily in the Schengen zone to go to work, the Bruegel think-tank reports.\nAnd opinion polls indicate that many Europeans value Schengen more than any other change brought about by the EU.\nBut temporary border controls have been reimposed - by France, Germany, Austria and Hungary.\nSo the stakes are high at this summit.\n\"Our goal is clear: we must regain control over our external borders to stem migratory flows and to preserve Schengen,\" said Mr Tusk in his summit invitation letter.\nMr Juncker said Europeans now have \"one border\" and \"a shared responsibility to protect it\".\n\"We want to defend everything Schengen represents, and let me tell you that Schengen is here to stay,\" he told the European Parliament.\nSaving Schengen means beefing up the surveillance of all people entering or leaving the Schengen area.\nSo in future EU citizens, as well as those from outside the bloc, will have their passports checked against police databases.\nThere is much work to do, however, to link up and improve those databases.\nMore than a million refugees and other migrants have surged into the EU this year, most of them desperate to reach Germany or other northern countries where job prospects are better, or where relatives can help them settle.\nThe Syrian war has pushed irregular migration to the EU to a record high.\nThere are fears that the international campaign to smash IS, and the Russian bombing in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, will drive even more Syrians to flee abroad.\nSo the 28 leaders in Brussels will look again at the EU's help for Greece and Turkey. The migrant registration process is still slow and patchy.\nTurkey, struggling with more than two million Syrian refugees, now has much bargaining power. Critics say the EU risks compromising its human rights standards as it leans on Turkey to curb the migrant flow.\nGreek coastguards and the EU's Frontex border agency only manage to intercept 20% of the migrants who reach Greek islands after life-threatening voyages, according to Frontex.\nThis week the Commission unveiled an ambitious plan for a new EU Border and Coast Guard to tackle problems on the EU's external borders.\nThe force - stronger than Frontex - would have 1,000 permanent staff and 1,500 reserves, who could be deployed rapidly to a trouble spot, within three days.\nThat could happen even without the host country requesting it - if the rest of the EU decides to take action.\nSuch force majeure might be the exception - but Poland has already raised objections on sovereignty grounds.\nOnce again, the migrant crisis is threatening to divide, more than unite, Europe.",

    "38024796": "The value of the invested savings and pensions of millions of people in the UK are dependant on asset managers.\nIn a damning report, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said there is weak price competition, leaving customers paying high charges.\nAn industry association said price transparency had been improving.\nThe FCA has studied the asset management system for a year, and has now published its interim report.\nIn a string of criticisms, it said that investors often paid high charges, there were examples of poor value for money in some funds, and that consultants could bring better results for pension savers.\n\"In today's world of persistently low interest rates, it is vital that we do everything possible to enable people to accumulate and earn a return on their savings which can meet their lifetime needs,\" said Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA.\n\"To achieve this, we need to ensure that competition in asset management works effectively to minimise the cost of investment.\n\"We want to see greater transparency so that investors can be clear about what they are paying and the impact charges have on their returns. We want asset managers to ensure investors receive value for money through pursuing energetically their duty to act in their customers' best interests.\"\nHe ruled out a price cap, which he argued would not encourage competition.\nSome investors have been critical of the sector for years, owing to the complicated structure of fees that can include charges for performance and transactions.\nThere was criticism in the report of \"actively-managed funds\" when a fund manager is paid to research the market. The extra cost to investors of this service were, on average, \"not justified by higher returns\", it said.\nThe FCA is proposing an all-in fee among other measures to help investors decide which fund is the best for them.\nIt also wants a more standard set of information across the sector making costs and charges clear.\nThe potential benefits of UK pension funds pooling their assets to gain better returns should also be explored, the FCA said.\nThe Investment Association, the trade body that represents UK investment managers, said that it had already been improving the transparency of costs.\n\"The investment management industry is committed to serving the needs of the UK's savers and investors and so we support the FCA's objectives to ensure that competition in the industry works to the benefit of its customers, whether individuals, families or institutions,\" said Chris Cummings, the association's chief executive.\n\"Over the coming weeks, we will engage closely with the FCA to understand its findings and the full implications of potential remedies.\"\nThe interim report now goes to consultation. The FCA said action could be announced next summer.\nOne of the City's most lucrative gravy trains is running out of steam.\nFund managers occupy a cosy world in which they have plenty of wiggle room on charges, make high profits and pick up tasty bonuses.\nThe FCA's solution is to have one easily-comparable charge and make value for money a priority. It might even ask the government to impose a statutory duty of care.\nBut the question which really stands out from this investigation is whether active fund management is really worth it. That's when managers pick the stocks they think will succeed.\nThe FCA found that investors in a passive fund which just tracks the market could earn a 44% higher return over 20 years, because of lower charges.\nMost investors would forgive even a sizeable charge if they had something to show for it.",

    "37045414": "Students earlier this summer took a total of 35,537 exams.\nBut what do we know about how well Wales is doing? How many students are going to university? And what happens next for those still with big decisions to make?\nMAKING THE GRADE\nA new top grade, A*, was introduced in 2010. A total of 6.6% achieved this in 2016, a fall on last year and still short of the UK average of 8.1%.\nThe proportion of students getting A* and A also fell again from 23.1% to 22.7% and Wales continues to trail the rest of the UK and all regions of England apart from the North East of England.\nWhen you look at individual subjects, more students in Wales have been getting top grades in maths over the last five years than in England - but in English language, Wales has been trailing, with the gap still 3.2% in the latest set of results.\nIn French, 31% got A* to A in Wales - this is an improvement, but 37.8% managed that in England. The gap was as wide as 14% in 2012. Numbers of students taking French have also gone down by 11% this year.\nWales and England are a little further apart now at the top grades for A-level physics, with Wales dropping back to 25.8% behind England on 29.6%.\nIt is worth looking too at how many students are only getting the lower grades.\nA slightly higher proportion in Wales - 23.5% - got D and E grades, compared to 20.6% in England. That gap has also widened slightly too.\nWales has more students getting these lower grades in English (23.2%) than who managed A* to A (15.9%) in the same subject.\nThere is also a more students getting D and E grades in French in Wales than in England for most of the last six years.\nDavid Evans, secretary of NUT Wales, said A-levels were the first time students specialised in subjects and it was important the quality of education and teaching was there.\n\"We need to look at the numbers who get  A* and celebrate them, and those who get As, Bs and Cs too,\" he said.\n\"We need to make sure we have a clear focus on those who achieve the grades they need for university and makes sure support is there for those who go on to do other things as well.\"\nOn the question of whether A-levels are getting easier, Phil McTague, head teacher of Ysgol Eirias in Colwyn Bay said: \"If Usain Bolt sets a new record in the hundred metres, people don't say the hundred metres is getting easier!  Our students have worked really hard this year and we're proud of all their results.\"\nHOW DOES WALES COMPARE WITH ENGLISH REGIONS?\nFor the first time last year, we were able to compare Wales' results with regions of England on the day they were published.\nWales has the lowest percentage of A*-C grades of any area - 73.8- including every English region.\nIt also has the lowest for A* and A - apart from the North East of England, which is now lower than Wales.\nWHAT IS THE PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOYS AND GIRLS?\nGirls continue to outperform boys overall in Wales, with 97.9% of entries by girls this year gaining A* to E grades, compared to 96.5% of boys.\nAt the A* grade, the performance of boys was marginally better than that of girls, with 6.7% of boys and 6.5% of girls gaining A* - both improving since 2013.\nYou can also see performance differences between boys and girls for the top grades within subjects - as well as a difference in subjects chosen. The likes of physics and computing are very male dominated compared to French, English and Welsh at the other end of the scale.\nGareth Pierce, chief executive of the WJEC exam board, said some of the patterns were long standing \"and a natural feature\".\nWhy do more girls go to university?\nHOW MANY STUDENTS APPLY FROM WALES?\nThere were 23,740 students from Wales applying to universities in the UK this year - and with many looking at more than one university, this meant a total of 40,010 applications to Ucas.\nThere is very little difference in the number of students from Wales applying to university over the last few years.\nMore than half a million students got higher education places in the UK last year - three quarters of those who applied. These included 20,500 students from Wales, a 1.7% rise and a new high, while 87.5% of 18-year-olds from Wales who applied got places.\nOf those 18-year-old students who applied to Welsh universities, 84% got an offer, while 75% of Welsh applicants to English universities got an offer.\nAlthough there is a lot of attention at schools on results day - only around half of those entering university are 18-year-olds; others take gap years while the number of students over 26 is rising again.\nBy the end of Thursday, Ucas said 17,510 students from Wales had places in higher education - more than at the same time over the last five years.\nSTILL, MORE 18-YEAR-OLDS ARE GOING TO UNIVERSITY\nWales recorded its highest entry rate - 28.2% of all 18-year-olds got higher education places through Ucas in 2015 - although that is behind England on 31.3%.\nWales has had one of the lowest proportional increases of UK nations and regions since 2006 - 13%.\nWHERE YOU LIVE CAN BE A FACTOR\nFewer pupils from poorer parts of Wales get to university.\nEntry rates are broken down across the UK into constituencies and analysis shows they are lower in more disadvantaged areas.\nIn Wales, the entry rate range is from just under 18% of 18-year-olds in Aberavon, to just over 48% in Cardiff North.\nFor those in the most disadvantaged districts in Wales the average rate is 16.6%, almost the same as the year before.\nBut compared with entry rates five years ago, 18-year-olds from disadvantaged areas in Wales were 23% more likely to be accepted for entry in 2015 - in England they were 30% more likely.\nMeanwhile, students living in what are classed as the most advantaged areas of Wales are five-and-a-half times more likely to go to a university with higher entry requirements than those from the most disadvantaged parts.\nLeading academic Prof Sir Deian Hopkin said the numbers from poorer backgrounds getting to university were still disappointing despite efforts.\n\"One of the great challenges in higher education is to attract students from less-affluent backgrounds because. very often, they come from an education system which doesn't encourage them to come to university in the first place,\" he said.\n\"Now a lot has been done over the years, there has been a big improvement, but the proportion has not grown at the same rate as the total increase in students in higher education. Therefore the challenge remains.\"\nProf Hopkin added: \"The disappointment in England is that the grant which supported many students has been abolished.\n\"In Wales, at least that has been maintained for now, but we need to see far more effort being put into encouraging, supporting and, indeed, mentoring students from backgrounds where these things are not natural.\"\nWHERE DO STUDENTS AT WELSH UNIVERSITIES COME FROM?\nAltogether, 77,750 students have already applied to Welsh universities - 18,450 from within Wales.\nThe chart shows where the others come from - more than half of them from England.\nUNCONDITIONAL OFFERS ON THE RISE\nThere has been a rise in students receiving unconditional offers from universities - which will have relieved the exam pressure a little for some. Across the UK, offers were made to 23,400 students in 2015,  compared to only 3,000 two years before.\nThis is around 2.5% of applications and involves 36 institutions, but there is no breakdown of how many are from Wales.\nCardiff and Swansea universities only made unconditional offers to students who are pre-qualified. This amounted to 1,200 for Cardiff this year.\nAberystwyth University said it made offers based on performance in its own scholarship exam, while Bangor University said it made unconditional offers to some of the most promising students, but they were looking \"at the whole package\" before deciding where to go.\nCLEARING: NO LONGER A LAST RESORT\nAround 4,100 students from Wales were looking for places on results day through the clearing system, which is a lower number than the last five years.\nA total of 300 students from Wales were given places on the first day, according to Ucas.\nClearing has become more of an accepted way in, no longer something to be embarrassed about for not getting the right grades.\nUcas says clearing has \"transformed into a respected and important route\" into higher education.\nAll Welsh universities are promoting their clearing services heavily, promoting many courses across the board.\nCardiff University had around 400 places available through clearing.\nBangor University said it was \"no longer seen or used as an opportunity of last resort\" and said it was seeing more students waiting to get their results before applying.\nDavid Moyle, Aberystwyth University's schools and colleges liaison manager, said there was no longer a stigma attached to clearing.\nThe university took 1,000 calls last year and was offering \"a limited number of places\" across 315 courses, with demand expected to be high in science and computing.\nThe aim is to ensure students \"get the best advice to make an informed decision\", said Mr Moyle.\nBack in 2013, Ben Grantham's A-level results were better than he expected and he was on the phone within an hour to clearing to get a place studying media and communication.\n\"With a process such as clearing it's important to act fast,\" said Ben, who recently graduated with first class honours.\n\"Hundreds of students will be in a position where they wish to apply for a course immediately following their results, and places are often limited and can fill up fast.\"\nJoanna Harris, of Careers Wales, said clearing could sometimes be a blessing in disguise to give students a chance to reflect and warned against making rushed decisions.\n\"Take a breath, do your research, look at the Ucas website for what's available or even ring the university you wanted to go to to see if they might still accept you first.,\" she said.\n\"There is often more than one university in towns and cities - don't make a rash decision, it's important, with the amount of money it will cost you, that you make the choice of course that's right for you.\"\nCLEARING DETAILS\nOTHER ROUTES\nOnly two thirds of 18-year-olds who left school last year went on to university, according to research by Careers Wales.\nWHAT IF I DON'T GET THE RIGHT GRADES?\nKerry Ann Wallace, 20, from Newbridge, Caerphilly, was upset after failing to get the right grades to study psychology last year but was in touch with a careers adviser.\nIt led her to a youth work apprenticeship at Torfaen council and she has ambitions to be a family support worker.\n\"I haven't looked back and it's great to be earning money while I learn,\" she said.\n\"If you're disappointed this week please go and talk to someone as I did, look online for things and don't be upset - find something you love.\"\nCareer adviser Joanna Harris, of Careers Wales, said it was important to take stock and look at options - but volunteering, an internship or part-time work can be useful additions to CVs ahead of the next step.\nSome will retake exams but there are also useful websites, such as notgoingtouni, which can point students on the career path, including apprenticeships.\n\"There's a choice,\" said Ms Harris. \"Just because you didn't get into Cardiff University, say, there might be a course somewhere else, there are foundation degrees and feeder degrees.\n\"If you're struggling, book an appointment with us or call us.\"",

Based on chances they deserved to win, but there was  big moment that didn't go our way, and who knows what might have happened.\"\nFormer England midfielder Jermaine Jenas: \"I don't think Swansea should have had a penalty as the distance from Gylfi Sigurdsson to Cesar Azpilicueta is too close and Azpilicueta's arm is already out. His hand is there because he's trying to stop Sigurdsson's run.\"\nEx-England captain Alan Shearer: \"I think it was a penalty.

Fury at Labour government's \u00a31m compensation for innocent Brit\".\nHe said the man's release in 2004 had \"followed a Parliamentary and massive media campaign led by the Daily Mail... and strongly supported by the then Conservative Opposition\".\nThe former PM continued: \"He was not paid compensation by my government. The compensation was agreed in 2010 by the [coalition] government...\"\nLord Blunkett, who was home secretary at the time of al-Harith's release, said he had never campaigned for his return, but \"fully accepted that the situation of British citizens held without trial there, was unsustainable and legally and morally indefensible\".\nThe government in 2004 had \"acted responsibly\" he said, adding that \"public controversy\" at the time had been about whether enough was being done to release detainees \"and not the wisdom of providing balanced reassurance\".\nLord Blunkett said those returning from Guantanamo Bay were kept under surveillance and monitored by the security services.\nJack Straw, who was foreign secretary in 2004, said he \"never regarded\" al-Harith as innocent \"and neither Mr Blair nor I ever said that he was innocent\".\n\"We judged that the risk was not so great as to prevent his release.\n\"Whenever you're making decisions about the release of prisoners you have to make a judgement, and sometimes those judgements are not borne out by events.\"\nLeon Jameson, al-Harith's older brother, says they last spoke two years ago on the phone, before he went to Syria.\nMr Jameson described his sibling as \"fun\" when he was growing up and \"always helping other people\".\nWhen asked about his brother's suicide bombing he said: \"I can't actually commend him about it because it isn't right, but he's done it. It's something he believes in, so I'll leave that with him.\n\"He did what he could for other people, which is what he used to always be like.\nAnd he said \"it had been a struggle\" for his brother ever since Guantanamo Bay. \"If he didn't even listen to his wife, none of us could have really changed his mind.\"",
    "36753964": "A black police chief who had worked diligently to improve community relations, and reduce the use of force, now had to confront a racially motivated attack by a young black man against his officers.\n\"We're hurting. Our profession is hurting. Dallas officers are hurting. We are heartbroken,\" he said.\nHe spoke on behalf of the Dallas Police Department, but his words echoed a personal statement he made six years earlier, in the wake of another Dallas police death.\nIn June 2010, just weeks after he was sworn in as police chief, a young Dallas officer and father was shot dead on father's day. The killer was Mr Brown's 27-year-old son.\n\"My family has not only lost a son, but a fellow police officer and a private citizen lost their lives at the hands of our son,\" he said.\n\"That hurts so deeply I cannot adequately express the sadness I feel inside my heart.\"\nMr Brown's son, David O'Neal Brown Jr, first shot dead a private citizen, Jeremy McMillan, as McMillan drove his family to his sister's house. He then shot police officer Craig Shaw, who was responding to the first shooting, more than a dozen times.\nMr Brown took a leave of absence, according to local news reports from the time, and there was speculation that he would resign.\nIt was not the first time he had suffered loss - in 1988, his former partner Walter Williams was killed in the line of duty. Three years later, his younger brother was shot dead by a drug dealer.\nBut Mr Brown returned to work, determined to improve the Dallas Police Department's relations with the community. The department began to focus on de-escalation rather than force. Mr Brown placed emphasis on community policing and increasing transparency, even at the cost of clashing with department figures.\nHe made enemies of the police unions by publicly sacking crooked officers, the Dallas Observer reported. He was told community policing was a waste of time.\nBut by 2014, five years after his appointment, excessive force complaints against Dallas officers had fallen by 64%.\n\"In my opinion, how can you argue with aggressive community policing if it has yielded the safest the city has been over 86 years?\" he said in an interview with the Observer in February.\nMr Brown's approach was visible on Thursday, in the hours before the gunman opened fire, as the police department's Twitter account posted pictures of officers posing with protesters and smiling.\n\"Men, women, boys and girls gathered at Belo Garden Park for the demonstration re: recent police involved shootings,\" said one tweet.\n\"Dallas police officers maintain traffic control to ensure the safety of the demonstrators,\" said another.\nIn the aftermath of the attack, several reporters who cover the Dallas Police Department pointed out the irony that the gunman targeted a force which had made strides to break the cycle of violence between its officers and community.\nSpeaking to the Observer in February, Mr Brown paid tribute to his officers and acknowledged the risks they took.\n\"Over the last 12 years we've lost five cops in the line of duty,\" he said. \"I mean, it's not just numbers on a page. It's sacrifice, and it's sacrifice at the highest level.\"\nDallas Police Department equalled that 12-year sacrifice in a few short hours on Thursday. On Friday, Mr Brown reiterated his plea for mutual respect.\n\"There are no words to describe the atrocity that occurred to our city,\" he said. \"All I know is that this: This must stop, this divisiveness between our police and our citizens.\"",

    "32192542": "MOTD2 pundit Danny Murphy expands on his TV analysis of the part his former Tottenham team-mate Jermain Defoe played in Sunderland's vital derby win over Newcastle.\nWhen I realised his starting position was on the right wing in a 4-3-3 formation, I was surprised to say the least.\nI know Jermain well from training and playing with and against him, and he does not particularly like playing in those wide areas - he certainly did not enjoy it back in the day.\nThat is understandable because he is a goalscorer and he lives off the goals he gets. He does not normally like being in areas of the pitch where he cannot affect the game in a positive way.\nBut obviously he was asked to play a different role by Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat because of their circumstances and he did a brilliant job for the team.\nI have never seen Defoe work as hard as he did to contribute defensively on Sunday - he tracked back on the left too and at one point he was making sliding tackles near his own corner flag, which was a first.\nHe is 32 now and he will not want to be doing that permanently. But knowing him like I do, if he is asked to do any kind of job for his team to help them stay in the Premier League then he will always give it his all.\nI do not think playing him there gets the best out of him, but it worked for Sunderland on Sunday.\nUltimately, Defoe only had one shot at goal in his 80 minutes on the pitch, but it was a world-class finish to win Sunderland the game and three vital points.\nThat is what they signed him for, and you could see from his celebration how much it meant to him.\nI have played in midfield behind Defoe and he is a very special talent in that he does not solely rely on through-balls.\nIf you get the ball to his feet, he has got the capability around the box to beat people himself and shoot from range with real power.\nDefoe has pace and thrives on being put through too of course, but one of the reasons he has scored as many goals as he has done in his career is that there are so many different elements to his game.\nYes he will get in the six-yard box to score you a tap-in but he can create goals for himself and, as Newcastle found out, score from distance as well.\nBefore that goal, he had not scored for six games which will have been hurting him because he is not used to it.\nBut I know that it will not have knocked his confidence because he is the sort of player that never loses faith in himself, and for good reason.\nThat bit of class he produced against Newcastle was the kind of moment of brilliance I have come to expect from him after playing with and against him down the years.\nDefoe's appetite was typical of the rest of the Sunderland team.\nWhat Dick Advocaat's side lack in quality, they make up for in physicality and endeavour which is a massive positive for them.\nThey have got some powerful players and they look fit, which is an often overlooked factor at this stage of the season.\nAgainst Newcastle, both of their full-backs - Billy Jones and Patrick van Aanholt - did brilliantly, flying up the wings.\nThey also have a few clever players, like Jordi Gomez and Seb Larsson, who have been in this position at the bottom of the table before and will be used to the pressure involved when you are fighting relegation.\nFrom what I saw of them in this game, they have got enough about them to beat the drop.\nBut that is mainly because of the quality Defoe gives them in the final third. He could be the difference between them staying up, or not.\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",
    "34856060": "Poorer pupils are particularly badly affected, says the head teacher training charity Future Leaders Trust.\nResearchers plotted the distance between state schools in England against the proportion of pupils achieving five good GCSEs.\nThe steepness of the drop in poorer pupils' grades was \"quite astounding\", said report author Katy Theobald.\nLooking at average GCSE attainment over three years to 2014, all students did worse in schools that were further apart - but the impact was greater on students eligible for free school meals, the researchers found.\nSchools less than 1km (0.6 miles) apart saw almost 68% of pupils overall achieving five A* to C GCSE grades. Among pupils eligible for free school meals, the figure was 49%.\nBut even a slight increase in the distance between schools saw a sharp drop in grades for poorer pupils, according to the study.\nA 1-2km gap between schools saw less than 42% of poorer pupils achieving good results, falling to less than 37% for poorer pupils at schools with a 3-4km gap.\nNationally, some 65% of pupils overall achieved five good GCSEs over the three-year period, while the figure for pupils eligible for free school meals was 42.6%.\nSo pupils at schools less than 1km from their nearest neighbour perform better than average on both counts, say the researchers.\nThey calculate that for each additional kilometre between schools, the attainment of free school meals students declines by an average of 1.06 percentage points.\nHowever, the average attainment of free school meals students was not lowest in the most geographically isolated schools - more than 15km from their nearest neighbours, according to the researchers, although it was still poorer than in the most highly populated areas.\nSome of the success of urban schools stemmed from the fact it was so much easier for teachers collaborate, said Ms Theobald.\n\"If you are in London you can just pop into another school to observe good practice - if you are in an isolated school, it's a whole day away,\" she said.\nIt is also harder for isolated schools to recruit staff at all levels, according to Malcolm Trobe, deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders.\nAnd all too often they were in areas of high unemployment, \"which makes the job of raising pupils' aspirations that little bit more difficult\", said Mr Trobe.",

    "27834240": "\"That village over there will be flooded,\" he points. \"Monkeys, birds, Indians - we'll all lose our homes.\"\nOver the last few months some 13,000 Munduruku have been protesting against government plans to build a series of hydroelectric dams that will flood part of their land on the upper reaches of the Tapajos river.\nAfter a week-long meeting back in April, the caciques (chiefs) from more than 60 villages issued a statement, demanding that the government listen to them before it presses ahead with the five dams planned for the river.\nWomen have not traditionally been fighters among the Munduruku, but now Maria Leusa Kaba Munduruku, the leader of a new group of female warriors, says that everyone must be involved.\n\"The government must recognise our rights, not just those of others,\" she stresses.\nDespite vociferous opposition from indigenous and environmental groups, construction is already well under way for the gigantic Belo Monte dam on the Xingu river.\nNow the new frontier for Brazil's hydropower expansion has moved to the Tapajos River - a huge tributary to the Amazon that lies further to the west.\nOpposition here is fierce as the region has some of the richest biodiversity in the world.\nAdrian Barnett, a British biologist working in the area, says that - even by the high standards of the Amazon basin - the Tapajos is an area of extreme biological richness.\nOf the 1,837 species of bird that occur in Brazil, 613 can be found in the Tapajos, he points out.\nThe government plans to award the contracts for the first of these dams, Sao Luiz do Tapajos, later this year.\nAlong with the next dam, Jatoba, it should come on stream by 2020.\nAs well as flooding 552 sq km (213 sq miles) of land, the dikes will change the river flow, disrupting the lives of indigenous and numerous fishing communities.\nThe dams will have an installed capacity of 8,471 megawatts and will generate as much electricity as Belo Monte.\nTo mitigate their environmental impact, the government is copying the oil-rig system used in the North Sea, bringing in workers by boat for two-week work shifts rather than building roads.\nThe authorities are adamant that they need to tap into the huge hydropower potential of the Amazon if Brazil is to have the energy to fuel its ambitious development programme.\nClaudio Salles, director of the Acende Brasil energy think tank, says that of the 19,000 additional megawatts the government plans to have by 2021, 16,000 will be generated in the Amazon.\n\"This gives you an idea of just how important this energy is for us,\" he says.\nBut some analysts believe that Brazil needs to rethink its development plans.\nCelio Bermann, a lecturer in energy and the environment at the University of Sao Paulo, says Brazil is providing big subsidies for electricity-hungry sectors, such as the smelting of bauxite in the Amazon to make aluminium, without thinking whether this is really in the country's long-term interests.\n\"We are exporting a tonne of aluminium for $1,450-1,500 (\u00c2\u00a3855-884) while importing manufactured aluminium goods at twice the cost.\n\"It makes no sense. I think it is absolutely undesirable for the country's aluminium output to double over the next 10 years,\" Mr Bermann adds.\nBrazil, he points out, is going back to being a producer of primary goods, without adding value.\n\"And it is precisely the production of primary goods that needs a lot of energy and generates few jobs.\"\nPreparatory work for the construction of the Teles Pires dam to be built on the Teles Pires river, a tributary of the Tapajos, has already led to the bulldozing of land around the Sete Quedas (Seven Waterfalls) - an area considered sacred by the Munduruku and other indigenous people.\nIn an open letter, Munduruku leaders complained: \"There are funerary urns there, where our ancient warriors are buried. There is also a portal, only seen by spiritual shaman leaders, who can travel through it to another, unknown world.\"\n\"Why have they destroyed this?\" one cacique asked.\nFor others, however, progress cannot be halted.\nJoao Francisco Vieira, a local councillor in the town of Jacareacanga, told the BBC: \"The Indians don't want to go back 300 years. They want to evolve, as the river flows to the sea. They want mobile phones. They want the internet.\"\nMaria Leusa Kaba Munduruku agrees that they want modern goods.\n\"But we want them while conserving our culture. That is possible and we will fight for it.\"",

Visibility in Shandong province south of Beijing was just 50m (164ft).\nOn Thursday, too, there were reported to be more than 100 cars in crashes in Beijing. The roads were icy and slippery, but poor visibility cannot have helped.\nWhat were billed as \"tough\" measures brought in by Beijing's government this week to try to improve things simply have not been enough.\nOn Tuesday, 103 factories were ordered to shut down, and a third of government cars ordered off the roads to combat what was already being described as the worst January smog since 1954.\nBut even state-controlled media now say Beijing's tough measures were ignored by city officials themselves.\nMore than 800 government vehicles ordered off the roads were still in use, and several construction sites ordered suspended were still active on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.\nSo everyone now is looking at the weather forecast, hoping the smog will be blown away by winds forecast for Friday.\nThat's about the only thing that will bring some respite.\nA bigger question will linger even after the smog has cleared: can China curb its polluting ways for good?\nJanuary's pollution has afflicted not just Beijing and its 20 million people, but more than 30 major cities and many tens of millions of people in addition.\nAs the Communist Party's English-language tabloid the Global Times put it in an editorial on Thursday: \"China's rapid development has brought us many benefits as well as accumulated many problems. Environmental protection should take up a more prominent position in China's future strategy even if it means that China's economic development will slow down.\"\n\"Chinese people,\" the paper said, \"should not tolerate environmental pollution for the pursuit of wealth... We cannot keep going with the situation that we have today.\"\nThe difficult bit is how to change the path China is on.\nOn the plus side, then, there is a growing realisation things have to change, and the media are now being allowed to debate the issue.\nChina's government seems to be in agreement. This week the cabinet approved an energy consumption \"control target\" for energy use by 2015.\nOn the minus side, that \"control target\" still means China's energy use will continue to expand, and, crucially, so will the burning of coal.\nAs Xinhua reported: \"to meet the target, average annual energy consumption growth should be controlled at around 4.3% between 2011 and 2015, lower than the 6.6-percent annual increase realized between 2006 and 2010\".\nThat means more emissions to come.\nAnd as if to prove that changing China's habits will be hard, there is another worry on the immediate horizon.\nChinese New Year is just days away. Letting off vast quantities of fireworks is part of the Spring Festival celebrations, but the fireworks produce huge amounts of pollution.\n\"Setting off fireworks contributed greatly to air pollution in Beijing for half a month after Spring Festival in 2011,\" according to Du Shaozhong, former deputy director of Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau.\nEight million people had already posted messages on China's Weibo microblogs this week debating whether the fireworks should be stopped this year.\nBut the office in charge of Beijing's firework industry has said that residents can set off fireworks during the Spring Festival holiday according to the regulations, but that the office hopes residents will refrain from doing so, the China Daily reported.\nI predict more smog.",
    "38648957": "Despite their differences over Brexit and the legacy of the Troubles, the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in maintained remarkable discipline after first the UUP, then the SDLP decided to leave the executive.\nUntil mid-December, the two parties' joint approach also extended to the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scandal.\nWhen a BBC Spotlight investigation into the RHI affair stirred widespread public concern, both parties appeared to be making progress behind the scenes in arranging some kind of an investigation. This would have supplemented the Public Accounts Committee which had been taking evidence on the scandal since September.\nBut after former DUP minister Jonathan Bell broke ranks on a Nolan TV special on 15 December those attempts to manage the crisis within the walls of Stormont Castle broke down.\nThen came the disastrous assembly sitting of 19 December, when the DUP decided to override Sinn F\u00e9in's concerns, pressing ahead with an Arlene Foster statement against Martin McGuinness's express wishes.\nOn the day, Sinn F\u00e9in's warning of \"grave consequences\" looked like the party might just be crying wolf. But in reality the die was cast, as republican grassroots anger grew.\nThe former Northern Ireland Secretary Lord Hain reckons Arlene Foster's handling of the fall-out from the scandal has been a \"textbook case of how not to manage a crisis\". Certainly the DUP has appeared to be caught napping by the speed with which this affair developed - offering concessions, expressions of regret or offers of inquiries too late to appease its critics.\nThe heating scandal has ignited the election, but will the battle ahead be a referendum on the RHI scandal as the Stormont opposition wants?\nFor different reasons, both the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in are keen on widening the battleground.\nThe DUP is framing the contest as an attempt to \"take Arlene Foster down\" and to push through investigations which would put soldiers and police officers in the dock over controversial Troubles killings.\nSinn F\u00e9in say it's all about the DUP's arrogance and the failure of both the DUP and the UK government to deliver on commitments in relation to the former jail at Maze/Long Kesh, the treatment of the Irish language and the logjam over the legacy of the troubles.\nOver and above these policy matters, it look likely that any fresh talks on the other side of the election will have to consider potential structural changes at Stormont.\nShould the mandatory coalition, whereby all the major parties have a right to be in government, be abandoned in favour of a more conventional voluntary coalition? Should weighted majority voting be introduced?\nShould Northern Ireland have two joint first ministers rather than a first and deputy first?\nShould there be radical changes to the petition of concern system which has led to frequent cross-community vetoes?  In the light of Brexit, are the cross-border institutions created under the Good Friday Agreement in need of reform?\nAll this looks like the stuff of talks which will last far longer than the three weeks the law allows to form a new executive after the March election.\nWhilst the major parties may talk about all this and more, expect their critics to use the campaign ahead to remind voters what brought Stormont down.\nIt seems hard to imagine that the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in won't emerge again as the main players. But we won't know until the votes are counted exactly what impact the negative publicity generated by the heating scandal has had on public opinion and party allegiance.\nCould a shift in opinion, for example, endanger the DUP's power to veto measures without requiring the assistance of other parties, for which 30 MLAs are required?\nThat point might be rendered academic if there is no Stormont assembly in which to wield a petition of concern.\nNevertheless the public can have their say in this election, even if it is only to determine the relative weights the parties will be able to throw around in the potentially protracted negotiations coming up.",
    "24942981": "In a paper looking at female genital cosmetic surgery, it says women and girls should realise that female genitalia come in all shapes and sizes.\nThey should also be told of the risks of this type of surgery.\nLabiaplasties on the NHS have risen fivefold in the past 10 years.\nLabiaplasty is the most common type of female genital cosmetic surgery, in which the size of the labia minora is reduced.\nIt can be a treatment for women who have concerns with hygiene, difficulties during sexual intercourse or discomfort when exercising, but some women and girls want surgery because of concerns about the way their genitalia look.\nIn extreme cases this can be linked to body dysmorphic disorder, which causes significant anxieties about body image.\nStatistics show that more than 2,000 labiaplasty operations were performed in 2010 on the NHS.\nMany more are carried out by private clinics but there are no figures available on these procedures, although the RCOG says \"the practice of labiaplasty is now widespread\".\nDame Suzi Leather, chair of the RCOG's ethics committee, said there was concern over the recent figures.\n\"Some women are requesting it solely for cosmetic reasons and these decisions are not always being made on an informed understanding of the normal variations that exist, but influenced by images from popular culture and the pornography industry.\n\"We need to inform women that everyone is unique and that variation in appearance is normal in the vast majority of cases,\" she said.\nThe RCOG paper recommends that women should be offered counselling and psychological treatment for problems such as \"body image distress\".\nThe paper says: \"Education, support and advice should be at the heart of clinical practice, with a sympathetic appreciation of female body insecurities.\"\nOfficial stats show that the labiaplasty procedure is not restricted to adults. In the past five years, 266 of these procedures have been carried out on girls under 14.\nWhile the reasons for the procedures are unknown, they are likely to have been performed for medical reasons or to correct congenital abnormalities.\nIn another paper, published by the British Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Gynaecology (BritSPAG), clinicians are advised to inform girls under 18 that labiaplasty surgery before puberty is complete can lead to long-term problems.\nAlthough no research has been carried out on these long-term risks, it is thought that damage to sexual function and sensitivity can occur after labiaplasty. Bleeding and wound infection can also occur in the short term.\nThe paper also recommends that girls showing signs of psychological problems should be referred to a paediatric clinical psychologist.\nConsultant plastic surgeon Paul Banwell, from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, welcomed the recommendations published in both papers and said patients should always be given full, accurate information and be properly counselled before surgery.\nBut he said clinicians should also be sensitive to potential problems.\n\"An asymmetrical labia can lead to functional problems as well as aesthetic problems. Over 50% of my patients see me due to functional reasons. Only a small proportion are there for purely aesthetic reasons.\"\nHe also said he had seen the number of patients requesting labiaplasty increase dramatically in the past few years.\nTim Goodacre, head of professional standards at the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons and a consultant plastic surgeon, said he supported the recommendations as a means of improving patient care.\n\"We would like to see tougher central regulation of the cosmetic surgery industry to help clamp down on anyone performing these operations unnecessarily, and without due consideration for patient care.\"\nBut he said he found attempts to increase profits by encouraging more female genital procedures \"abhorrent\".\nHe added: \"We urge stringent and robust restrictions on advertising such operations with a firm objective to limit any material other than that with information only. All advertising that could in any way be seen as persuasive should be banned.\"",

They don't wage war, but they sow terror, fear, mistrust. \"Will I take the metro to get to the station?\" \"What's that large suitcase doing there?\" \"Does that man look suspicious?\"\nDivision. Rage, and rage combined with fear and suspicion, makes hatred.\nTerrorists know exactly how to fix a deadly cocktail, but are the rest of us compelled to drink it? Those who are now calling for an iron-fisted response to knock \"the Other\" senseless, are screaming out their impotence: their inability to comprehend this inhuman violence, but also their incomprehension of why this violence can exist.\nWe all share that inability and incomprehension today. The hate that comes with it, for some, at its worst creates for the low-minded a chance for political opportunism.\nWhat we need are bridges and oneness. We should embrace everybody who rejects political violence. We need everyone.\nToday the urgencies precede the nuances: we must care for the wounded, avert the imminent threat, bury the dead, clear the rubble. But the next task is to avoid having the wedge that the terrorist exploded into our society be driven deeper and steadier by angry citizens.\nWe urgently need an effective answer to violent radicalisation. Some people have been working on finding that answer, but we need it faster - as soon as we discard our torn garb, admit and acknowledge our grief, focus our anger and face the damage.\nThe work that lies in front of us is wide-ranging, but it should involve us all. It is easier to formulate the mission than to execute it, but we know that we cannot move forward without starting, immediately, by building a consensus around that mission, in order to make the reaction to these attacks inclusive instead of divisive.\nThe first priority of our governments - and we have lots of them in little Belgium - is to guarantee an effective security for all citizens, with all the resources that takes.\nThose same governments should also as a priority invest in the society they have to protect: in trust, in the opportunity to have a future, in spaces of encounter, in democratic debate, in the belief that every call to defend \"our values\" does literally concern every citizen.\nOur leaders must stand tall and adopt the manner of then Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg following Anders Breivik's attacks in 2012: \"We are still shocked by what has happened, but we will never give up our values. Our response is more democracy, more openness, and more humanity. We will answer hatred with love.\"\nTerror aims first at citizens, but they need not be solely its first victims; they can become the first responders. The unity we need embraces disagreement, because the society we need and want to defend is democratic, pluralistic and diverse.\nWe might understand today that ugly prejudices seep through the fissures that the attacks created in the social fabric, but tomorrow people of all persuasions and inspirations should join hands to mend both the fissures and the prejudices.\nWe urgently need new scaffolding to repair the bombed bridges and to reconstruct a (better) way of living together.\nWords that are drenched in vitriol today are multiplied by social networks - those which always function, even when roads are blocked, trains stand still and mobile networks fail. They must be washed clean so they can be re-used for better purposes.\nE pluribus unum, reads the United States seal: \"one from many\", unity from diversity. That is what Belgium, and the whole world, needs.\nBelgium's motto is \"Unity makes strength\".

    "34649067": "A series of amendments to a regulation on how internet traffic is managed in Europe were all rejected by MEPs.\nProponents of net neutrality, who demand that web traffic be treated equally by networks, have already criticised the move.\nThe existing legislation, which was accepted, will be developed into regulations.\nCampaigners have said that provisions for protecting net neutrality in the existing text of the rules are too vague and many worry that it will be easy for internet firms to strike deals with content providers which may not be advantageous for everyone.\nFor example, it is thought that so-called \"zero rating\" agreements, in which customers can access certain sites and services for free outside their data plans, might become more widespread.\nWhile this could be beneficial for those who want to access content from those providers, others worry that it will stifle innovation.\nThe rules, however, do stipulate that network companies will not be able to offer or market paid-for access to \"fast lanes\". Traffic management, they add, should be based on objective technical requirements.\nAlthough some campaigners had suggested there might be growing support for the amendments within the parliament, all were voted down in large majorities.\nIt is thought that many MEPs would have been reluctant to begin a process of amending the regulation given that it might have delayed another aspect of the rules - the abolition of mobile data roaming charges.\nThe result is \"hardly surprising\" according to legal expert Chris Marsden at the University of Sussex, given that many of the major parties represented in the parliament all supported the regulation text without amendments.\nThe Body of European Regulators (BEREC) would now have nine months to issue guidelines to bodies like Ofcom in the UK, he added.\n\"So, [by] September next year we will have the guidelines and the real enforcement work begins,\" he told the BBC.\nDr Marsden also said there were still plenty of unknowns, such as what form regulations on \"zero ratings\" and fast and slow lane services might actually take.\nThere was also the issue of how laws in the Netherlands, Slovenia and Finland - which all have special net neutrality protections in place - would be affected.\nSome initial guidelines, Dr Marsden added, would not be ready until 2016.\nMichael Theurer, a liberal German MEP described the outcome as \"regrettable\" and added that he felt the regulations as passed do not include a clear definition of net neutrality to inform regulators.\nPrior to the vote, the inventor of the world wide web Sir Tim Berners-Lee and a host of tech companies had expressed their support for the amendments and urged MEPs to vote them through.\nFirms which has openly supported the amendments included:\n\"The fact is that what we use the internet for in 2015 is vastly different from those early days when Tim Berners-Lee was inventing the web,\" commented Chris Green of business consultancy Lewis as he pointed out that the rise of video streaming had placed extra burdens on network companies.\n\"Maintaining that information flow is an expensive process and the cost of running that infrastructure is falling on the shoulders of ISPs.\n\"For them, a two-tier internet makes much more sense,\" he told the BBC.\nThe idea that data should be ferried from place to place as quickly as possible, regardless of what it is, is how most people assume the internet works.\nThat's the essence of net neutrality.\nHowever, it's possible to decide to prioritise certain types of data over others - perhaps, for example, by charging the producers of such data a fee to make sure their content gets delivered promptly.\nFor big video streaming sites, the prospect is worrying. They could find themselves coughing up lots of money in fees simply to give their users the same experience as before.\nSome argue, however, that such fees are fair since it costs internet service providers a lot of money to keep providing such content, no matter how popular the streaming sites become.\nPart of the problem with the rules in their current form, argued Joe McNamee at the European Digital Rights campaign group, is that they are ambiguous.\n\"As the text currently stands there is no indication as to how much abuse of dominance would be permissible under this arrangement,\" he told the BBC.\nThe sort of scenarios that could impact internet use include the creation of \"fast lanes\" and \"slow lanes\" or the creation of \"zero ratings\" in which some services may be accessed without using up any of the internet user's data quota.\nIn Belgium, for example,  some mobile phone companies currently allow unlimited access to Twitter and Facebook while all other data usage is part of a monthly plan. In a few countries such as the Netherlands, such practices are not allowed.\nBesides a host of net neutrality campaigners, inventor of the world wide web Sir Tim Berners-Lee had added his voice to those supporting the amendments.\n\"If adopted as currently written, these rules will threaten innovation, free speech and privacy, and compromise Europe's ability to lead in the digital economy,\" he wrote in a blog.\nAnd a string of tech companies signed a letter to the president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, asking MEPs to adopt the amendments.\nThe firms included Netflix, Tumblr, Vimeo, Kickstarter and Reddit.\n\"I was contacted by a number of start-ups and investors because they were deeply concerned about the impact of the European Parliament's network neutrality proposals on start-up innovation in Europe,\" Stanford professor Barbara van Schewick, who helped pen the letter, told the BBC.\nInterestingly, three countries within the EU - Netherlands, Slovenia and Finland - already have a range of net neutrality rules enshrined in law.\nThese laws might have to be altered depending on how the new, EU-wide rules are interpreted by regulators later.\nElsewhere, net neutrality has received some regulatory protection in the United States after a vote in February this year placed new restrictions on what deals could be sought by internet firms with content providers.\nBut in other countries, such as India, \"zero rating\" is allowed.\n\"It's a fragmented picture across the board,\" said Dr Marsden.\n\"It's an extremely difficult area and there are probably no absolutely right answers.\"",

We're now going to see the truth.\"\nA web portal has been opened where anyone can play with Gaia data and look for novel phenomena.\nWhen a group of schoolchildren showed the BBC how to do it last week, they stumbled across a supernova - an exploded star.\nThe European Space Agency (Esa) launched its Gaia mission in 2013.\nIts goal was to update and extend the work of a previous satellite from the 1980s/90s called Hipparcos.\nThis observatory made the go-to Milky Way catalogue for its time - an astonishing chart of our cosmic neighbourhood.\nIt mapped the precise position, brightness, distance and proper motion (that sideways movement on the sky) of 100,000 stars.\nGaia, with its first release of data, has just increased that haul 20-fold.\nGaia's imperative - To work out how far it is to the nearest stars\nIt is a function of the leap in technology, of course.\nThe new mission actually carries two telescopes, which it scans across the Milky Way from a location about 1.5 million km from Earth.\nThe telescopes' mirrors throw their captured light on to a huge, one-billion-pixel camera detector connected to a trio of instruments.\nIt is this ultra-stable and supersensitive optical equipment that Gaia uses to pick out its sample of stars with extraordinary confidence.\nThe called-for specification was to get to know the brightest objects' coordinates down to an error of just seven micro-arcseconds.\nThis angle is equivalent to the size of a euro coin on the Moon as seen from Earth.\nIn addition to their position and proper motion, the stars are having their physical properties analysed by Gaia.\nIts instruments are acquiring details such temperature and composition. These are markers needed to help determine the stars' ages.\nNot all of this information can be gleaned at once. It will take repeat viewing, but by the end of five years of operations the 100,000 stars fully profiled by Hipparcos should become at least a billion in the Gaia catalogue. That is a conservative estimate, however.\nIf one thing is clear from the new data it is that Gaia is seeing many more fainter stars than anyone anticipated. Once the project is complete it could have plotted 2-3 billion light sources.\nGaia - The discovery machine\nAstronomers around the world will have dived into the data the moment it went live on servers on Wednesday - and for all manner of reasons.\nSome of the 1.1 billion light sources will not actually be stars; they will be the very bright centres of very distant galaxies - what are known as quasars.\nThe nature of their light can be used to calculate the mass of all the stuff between them and us - a means, in effect, to weigh the Universe.\nA good number of other data-users will be planet-hunters. By studying the way Gaia's stars appear to wobble on the sky, it should be possible to infer the gravitational presence of orbiting worlds.\n\"Gaia is going to be extremely useful for exoplanets, and especially systems that have the Jupiter kind of planets,\" said Esa's Gaia project scientist, Timo Prusti.\n\"The numbers are going to be impressive; we expect 20,000. The thing is, you need patience because the exoplanets are something where you have to collect five years of data to see the deviation in the movements.\"\nBy way of comparison, in the past 20 years of planet-hunting, astronomers have confirmed 3,000 worlds beyond our Solar System.\nOne eagerly anticipated measurement is the radial velocity of stars. This describes the movement they make towards or away from Gaia as they turn around the galaxy.\nIf this measurement is combined with the stars' proper motion, it will lay bare the dynamics of the Milky Way.\nIt should be possible, for example, to make a kind of time-lapse movie - to run forwards to see how the galaxy might evolve into the future, or to run backwards to see how our cosmic neighbourhood came to be the shape it is today.\nAt the outset of the mission, scientists had hoped to get radial velocity data on about 150 million stars.\nBut this was thrown into doubt when it was realised soon after Gaia's launch that unexpected stray light was getting into the telescope. This made the observation of the faintest stars and their colours far more challenging.\nEngineers think they understand the problem: in part it is caused by the way sunlight bends past the 10m-diameter shade that Gaia uses to keep its telescopes in shadow.\nAnd the good news according to the scientists is that they think they can work around the difficulties.\nThe longer the mission runs, they believe, the closer Gaia will get to its target of 150 million radial velocity measurements - and that movie.\n\"Clearly, with the stray light we lost sensitivity. On the other hand, it happens to be that there are more stars than were thought before. So we're still talking about 100 million radial velocities,\" Timo Prusti told BBC News.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",
    "38674697": "It is feared Toshiba may have to write down the value of the unit by a larger-than-expected 700bn yen ($6.1bn; \u00c2\u00a35bn).\nThere are unconfirmed reports Toshiba is seeking aid from the government-backed Development Bank of Japan (DBJ).\nToshiba said the exact writedown figure was not finalised, and declined to comment on any DBJ approach.\nThe laptops-to-hydro power giant was plunged into crisis late last year when it emerged it faced huge cost overruns on projects handled by a newly-bought company that builds US nuclear power plants.\nToshiba's US operation Westinghouse paid about $229m in 2015 for Stone & Webster, the nuclear construction subsidiary of Chicago Bridge & Iron.\nBut on 27 December Toshiba admitted that it faced writedowns of \"several billion dollars\". The company later indicated that the size of the writedowns would be between $1bn and $4.5bn.\nToshiba's nuclear services business brings in about one-third of the industrial giant's revenue.\nThe share price, down 26% at one stage on Thursday, is now 50% lower than when the writedown revelations emerged amid fears that the company still has no firm grip on the final costs.\nThe company, at the heart of Japan's industrial development for decades, is still recovering from revelations in 2015 that profits were overstated for seven years.\nThat accounting scandal led to the resignation of the company's chief executive.\nJapan's Nikkei newspaper and the Reuters agency were among news groups reporting that Toshiba had approached the country's development bank, and is looking to spin-off its profitable Nand computer memory division to raise cash.\nToshiba is thought to have been in close contact with its bank lenders about providing more financial support. Reuters said there would be more meetings with the main banks this week.\n\"The key thing to watch here is whether Toshiba's liabilities will exceed its assets. If that happens it will be difficult for some banks to step up with new financing,\" said Mana Nakazora, chief credit analyst at BNP Paribas.\nMr Nakazora said, however, she did not expect Toshiba to default on its debt as its main banks would stick by it, adding that some sort of package involving asset sales, financing and capital from the government was the most likely solution.\nIn a statement on Thursday, Toshiba said it was still assessing the scale of the writedown.\n\"We are still discussing how to deal with this issue, and no concrete decisions have been made,\" the company said.",
    "40525767": "It reflects the tradition that, while a president is overseas, domestic bickering should be put on hold, as partisan grievances are best kept within the family.\nThose norms, which used to be considered iron-clad, have frayed considerably in recent decades. Leave it to Donald Trump, however, to throw kerosene on whatever remains and dance around the ashes.\nIn a three-minute exchange with reporters in Warsaw, Mr Trump aired a wide range of his usual grievances - against the US media, his presidential predecessor and the US intelligence community.\nHere's a closer look:\nTrump:\"I've said it very simply, I think it could very well have been Russia but I think it could well have been other countries and I won't be specific, but a lot of people interfere.\"\nAnthony: The question that set Mr Trump off, from MSNBC reporter Hallie Jackson, was direct. \"Will you once and for all yes or no definitively say that Russia interfered in the 2016 election?\"\nHis answer was far from a definitive \"yes\". Instead he engaged in several paragraphs worth of water-muddying along the lines of past remarks, where he has suggested the Chinese or some \"400-pound person sitting in bed\" could be the true culprit behind the email hacks of top Democratic officials in 2016.\nTrump: \"Barack Obama, when he found out about this in terms of if it was Russia, found out about it in August. Now the election was in November. That's a lot of time he did nothing about it.\"\nAnthony: According to the Washington Post article that detailed the extent of the information available to Mr Obama at the time - including that Russian President Vladimir Putin had directly ordered election meddling -  the then-president took several steps.\nIn September, he directly warned Mr Putin face-to-face to stop Russian cyber-activities in the US. He directed his intelligence officials to reach out to congressional leadership, although the Republicans were reluctant to participate in any bipartisan call for action.\nHe also informed state governments to ensure that their electoral systems were secure.\nTrump: \"They say he choked. Well, I don't think he choked.\"\nAnthony: Mr Obama's response didn't go over well with everyone in his administration. Mr Trump is referencing a line in that same Washington Post article, from a senior Obama official who felt the US government didn't do enough to punish Russia for what appeared to be a brazen attempt to destabilise the US election.\nThere's a certain amount of irony that Mr Trump would highlight this anonymous remark, given how frequently he and his aides have condemned reliance on anonymous sources in news stories critical of his own administration.\nTrump: \"He thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the election and he said let's not do anything about it. Had he thought the other way he would have done something about it.\"\nAnthony: The Washington Post article reported that Mr Obama decided not to go public with the evidence of Russian involvement because of concerns that it might provoke further Russian action, reveal US intelligence-gathering resources or be cited by Mr Trump as evidence that Democrats were \"rigging\" the US election against him, an accusation he was regularly making in the closing days of the presidential campaign\nMr Trump has apparently concluded that if the situation for Mrs Clinton had appeared more dire, he would have been more aggressive in his response. It's a charge that is impossible to prove, of course - but it allows Mr Trump once again to bask in the unexpected nature of his presidential triumph.\nTrump: \"I heard it was 17 agencies. Boy, that's a lot. Do we even have that many intelligence agencies?\"\nAnthony: Yes, the US does. The CIA and the FBI are the big ones, but there are also intelligence divisions within the State, Defence, Homeland Security, Treasury and Energy departments, as well as multiple military intelligence offices.\nIt's not something most Americans would be expected to know. Whether those at the top of the US government should have a basic familiarity with the nation's national security establishment is another question.\nMr Trump brings this up because of New York Times and Associated press reports that all 17 agencies had signed off on the conclusion that Russia had meddled in the 2016 US election.\nTrump: \"We did some very heavy research, and it turned out to be three or four. It wasn't 17 and many of your compatriots had to change their reporting, and they had to apologise and they had to correct.\"\nAnthony: It seems like it wouldn't take too much \"heavy research\" for the administration to discover the findings of its own intelligence apparatus, but the president is correct that the New York Times and Associated Press have corrected their initial reports.\nThe assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election was the result of efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, and published in a report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which represents all US intelligence agencies. Other intelligence divisions, like Coast Guard Intelligence, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the Drug Enforcement Administration's Office of National Security Intelligence would have had nothing relevant to add to the report.\nObama Administration Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pointed this out multiple times during testimony before Congress on 8 May, but the media outlets only recently modified their original articles.\nNeither the Associated Press or the New York Times \"apologised\", however.\nTrump: \"I remember that I was sitting back listening about Iraq. Weapons of mass destruction. How everybody was 100% sure that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Guess what, that led to one big mess. They were wrong.\"\nAnthony: During the Republican primary campaign Mr Trump frequently criticised George W Bush and members of his administration for launching the Iraq War based on the faulty conclusion that Saddam Hussein was pursuing a chemical, biological or nuclear weapons programme.\nAt the time it was considered remarkable that a Republican candidate would break with party orthodoxy on the merits of the military operation.\nMaking those charges on a debate stage is one thing, however. Highlighting the shortcomings of US intelligence on foreign soil, in front of the world media, while standing next to a fellow head of state, however, is astounding.\nTrump: \"I think what CNN did was unfortunate for them, as you know now, they have some pretty serious problems. They have been fake news for a long time, they've been covering me in a very dishonest way. Do you have that also, Mr President?\"\nAnthony: It was probably inevitable that Mr Trump would be asked to comment about Sunday's CNN-wrestling tweet, and he took the opportunity to take another swipe at the US cable news network.\nWhat makes this time a different, of course, was the president's aside to the Polish leader, who has been accused of cracking down on his own nation's free press. He recently blocked adversarial reporters from covering parliament and in January 2016 fired the executives of the nation's public radio and television networks, replacing them with individuals more friendly to the government.\nSuch an action is well outside of the power of a US president, but the New York Times did note that Mr Trump isn't without his own \"leverage\" over CNN, as his administration is currently reviewing whether to let the network's parent company, Time Warner, merge with telecommunications giant AT&T.\n\"Mr Trump's Justice Department will decide whether to approve the merger, and while analysts say there is little to stop the deal from moving forward, the president's animus toward CNN remains a wild card,\" the paper reports.\nTrump: \"NBC equally is bad, despite the fact that I made them a fortune with The Apprentice, but they forgot that.\"\nAnthony: NBC News officials will likely howl at the insinuation that their coverage could ever be influenced by commercial considerations of their network - even if the Apprentice, at least early in its 14-season run, was a ratings success.\nDonald Trump didn't make out too badly from his involvement with his reality television show, either. According to campaign disclosures, he earned more than $213m from the programme.\nAnd the visibility he received from being portrayed as a take-charge executive once a week on prime-time commercial television?\nThat, as they say, was priceless.",
    "27165110": "While there was Scottish 10,000m gold for Liz Lynch, now Liz McColgan, the Games came at a heavy financial cost due to the boycott by 32 out of the 59 competing nations.\nTeams withdrew after being angered by the British government's attitude to apartheid-era South Africa.\nOne of the nations that pulled out was Bermuda.\nAs Scotland prepares to host the Games once more, memories of the Edinburgh Games were brought back this week when the Queen's Baton Relay - the main curtain raiser for the Games - passed through the North Atlantic island.\nFor Bermudian swimmer Victor Ruberry and 100m runner Bill Trott, 1986 was a farce.\nIt is an episode of their lives which still causes frustration.\nBefore the Games, Ruberry and Trott were gravely concerned like thousands of others about apartheid in South Africa. They remember discussions on the island about boycotting, but no decision was made and the athletes made their way to Scotland.\nThey just wanted to compete. However, the Bermuda Olympic Association (BOA) - the governing body of the team - was still considering what to do.\nWhen the athletes arrived in Edinburgh, there were reports of safety concerns for the Bermudians. According to team manager John Morbey, this was one of the reasons given behind the team's eventual withdrawal.\n\"The night before the opening ceremony, a teammate and I caught a taxi and we went to a disco,\" recalls Trott, who was looking forward to his first Commonwealth Games having competed in the 1984 Olympics.\n\"There was no-one supervising us, and that is how safe we felt. As we came back late at night, we bumped into John Morbey and he had just found out that the Bermuda Olympic Association had pulled us out.\n\"That is when all the drama started. I was deflated.\"\nTrott and Ruberry woke up on 24 July, the day of the opening ceremony, with no idea what was going on.\nAfter a day of discussions, Trott remembers a call was eventually made to Bermuda's leader John Swan while the opening ceremony was taking place on television screens behind them.\nSwan offered his support, and Trott and his teammates frantically got dressed into their Panama hats, blue blazers and beige shorts and rushed to Meadowbank Stadium to take part.\nHaving missed their slot, they marched on just before the host nation and received one of the biggest cheers of the night, with Scottish fans - facing a Commonwealth Games without half the Commonwealth - showing their delight.\nRuberry, meanwhile, missed the ceremony as he prepared to take part in his 100m breaststroke the following day.\nHe remembers Morbey coming into his room around midnight to confirm he would be swimming in the morning. By the time he had reached the pool, Ruberry knew it was all in vain.\nThe BOA had finally decided to remove the team from the Games.\nRuberry was disqualified for keeping his head under water at the end of his race.\nHe said: \"Your mental state was not one where you were focused on competition.\n\"It was an abysmal swim. It was nowhere near what I was prepped to do prior to that. I am not making excuses, I just did not feel ready. At one point we were packing our bags, the next moment we were unpacking our bags.\"\nAfter the team's withdrawal, Morbey went on television in disgust over the BOA's decision while the athletes hung their bed sheets out the window with 'Bermuda wants to stay, don't penalise our athletes' written on one.\nWhen the Bermudians returned home, Trott remembered an island sympathetic towards the athletes but behind the decision to boycott.\nTwenty-eight years later, the athletes still reflect on what the 1986 boycott meant for them.\nTrott said: \"It was unfortunate that we were put in a situation like that. What I learnt from all of that was politics can play a role in some cases that it shouldn't.\"\nAdventurer Mark Beaumont reports on the Queen's Baton Relay as it makes its way to 70 nations and territories of the Commonwealth. He makes regular reports online, on radio and on television\nBBC Queen's Baton Relay: Glasgow 2014\nFollow Mark Beaumont on Twitter\nFor Ruberry, the Edinburgh Games were the second time his dreams had been shattered by a political boycott after missing out on the 1980 Moscow Olympics.\nHe gave up swimming, believing the countless hours of training were not worth it when it could all be scuppered by a boycott.\nHe returned to the pool for the 1988 Olympics, and now works as a swimming coach on the island.\nHe said: \"Any sporting event brings people together. Boycotts serve to divide.\n\"They are a huge disappointment for the athletes who have been training so hard for something like that, and all of a sudden you take away the goalposts.\n\"I still to this day don't believe there is a place for boycotts in sport. There is so much more that can be accomplished by the positives - the healthy competition, people coming together.\n\"If you are going to do something political, then don't use the athletes as pawns.\"",

    "34835193": "You might argue about the order in which they should be placed, but few fans - aside from some Barcelona or Real Madrid followers who are unwilling to praise their greatest enemy's biggest star - would question the suggestion that those two are head and shoulders above everybody else.\nThat impression is supported by the result of the annual Ballon d'Or award, which has been presented to Messi in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 and to Ronaldo in 2008, 2013 and 2014, with nobody else claiming the prize since Kaka in 2007.\nNow, however, perhaps it is time to reconsider the old notion that nobody else comes close to touching Messi and Ronaldo, because another flamboyant talent is also performing at similarly outrageous levels: Neymar.\nAnd this weekend he could have no bigger stage to prove it, as Barcelona travel to Real Madrid for the first Clasico of the season.\nLate on in Barcelona's home game with Villarreal this month, with the hosts leading 2-0 through goals from Neymar and Luis Suarez, a familiar chant echoed around the Nou Camp as fans reminded an injured hero that he had not been forgotten: \"Meeessi, Meeessi, Meeessi\u2026\"\nWhile they sang, Barca surged forward and Luis Suarez advanced down the left before curling a bouncing cross towards Neymar on the edge of the penalty area.\nWhat Neymar did next will never be forgotten by those fortunate enough to witness it, with the Brazilian forward conjuring a piece of magic which his national team coach Dunga later described as \"the sort of thing that makes football the beautiful game\".\nWith his back to goal, Neymar controlled the cross with his stomach, then immediately flicked it over his head to lose his marker and swivelled 180 degrees to meet the dropping ball with a fierce low volley which flew into the back of the net.\nThe goal was met with astonishment as much as jubilation, and more than 70,000 fans rose to their feet to acclaim the scorer by quickly adapting their previous chant: \"Neeeymar, Neeeymar, Neeeymar.\"\nSame song, different name and, although he obviously did not mean it in this way, the goal felt like a symbolic moment with Neymar delivering an emphatic message to the watching world: 'Forget Messi. I'm king now.'\nThat goal against Villarreal was Neymar's 11th of the season in La Liga, making him the league's top scorer - three ahead of Ronaldo despite playing 93 fewer minutes.\nNot insignificantly, he has been in a particularly rich vein of form during Messi's spell on the sidelines, rising to the challenge of compensating for his fellow South American's absence by scoring 10 goals in his past seven club games.\nAlthough this season's achievements have been particularly impressive, nobody should be too surprised to see Neymar making such a big impact because he has been scoring goals for fun ever since breaking into the Santos first team at the age of 17.\nHe is still only 23, yet Neymar has 249 career goals: 136 for Santos, 67 for Barcelona and 46 for Brazil.\nTo put those figures into context, by the time Messi and Ronaldo reached the age Neymar is now (23 years and nine months), they had 'only' registered respective career goal tallies of 186 and 127.\nEach case is different, with Ronaldo needing some time to develop into the awesome physical specimen he is today, while Messi's younger years were spent in a Barcelona team containing other established stars who commanded more than their fair share of attention.\nFurthermore, you could argue that a chunk of Neymar's early goals came 'cheaply' as they were scored in the relatively low standard Brazilian state championship.\nWhile it does not necessarily follow that Neymar will end up scoring more goals than Messi and Ronaldo simply because he has scored more than them by his current age, surely it suggests that this young man from Sao Paulo should be taken seriously as a potential all-time great?\nNeymar's electrifying performances over the past few weeks have attracted considerable attention in Spain and Albert Masnou, the deputy editor of Barcelona-based newspaper Sport, believes he is playing better than Ronaldo.\n\"At the moment he is surpassing Ronaldo,\" Masnou told BBC Sport. \"Cristiano is enduring a 'grey' period, uncomfortable with his club and his coach. He isn't leading his team or serving as their reference point, although that could easily change in just one game.\n\"But Neymar has become more integral to Barca. He is more consistent and growing a lot as the years go by. Now he is capable of leading the team when Messi's not there, and we are seeing his full potential.\"\nThose views were echoed by a man who knows Neymar extremely well: Tata Martino, who was his coach at Barcelona when he arrived from Santos in the summer of 2013 and who is now in charge of Argentina.\nBefore last week's World Cup qualifier between the two nations, Martino commented: \"Neymar has reached a point of maturity. What he's doing now puts him on a level with the two footballers we consider above the rest.\"\nRonaldinho, who remains a revered figure among Barcelona fans, was also glowing in his tribute of his countryman as he enthused: \"Neymar is a phenomenon. It's nice to see a Brazilian continuing to make history and I think he can be the greatest in the world.\"\nIt will soon get much harder for Neymar to maintain his recent standards, however, because Messi's absence through injury is nearly over. And when that happens, the focus of the Barca team and everyone else - fans, media and opponents - will immediately return to the Argentine.\nMessi is, quite simply, the man around whom the Catalans have built their team, and when he is on the pitch the primary function of the other 10 players is to service him.\nMessi's status is illustrated off the pitch by the parrot-like phrase trotted out weekly by every Barca player that he is \"the best player in the world\", and manager Luis Enrique notably brushed aside a question after the Villarreal game asking whether Neymar is the second best, instead blandly asserting that he is proud to coach lots of great players.\nConsidering Messi's consistent greatness, the reliance upon him is understandable. But it does mean the other players are forced to somewhat subdue their natural games in order to meet the demands of contributing to a team built around Messi.\nSome, such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Alexis Sanchez, have been forced to leave in order to allow their personal talents to flourish. Others - and there is perhaps no better example than Neymar - have accepted that role and made the most out of playing for Messi first, the team second and themselves third.\nMasnou says Neymar will, in the short term, have no problem stepping out of the spotlight once Messi returns.\n\"He didn't join Barca to overshadow Messi, but to be his heir,\" Masnou said. \"Neymar has been the king for two months but he knows that when Messi is there, the leader is Messi.\"\nNeymar is widely regarded in Barcelona as the heir apparent: the player lined up to become the team's focal point when Messi has retired or entered into decline.\nThe question, however, is how much longer Neymar will be prepared to accept that role. Messi is only 28 and could still be performing at or near his peak for another four or five years.\nBy then, Neymar will be in his late 20s and may well have grown tired of being the chief member of the supporting cast rather than taking the lead role.\nPerhaps the key for Barca will be to create a slightly more level playing field, one which places just as much importance in Neymar as it does in Messi: to use Masnou's poetic phrase, a system which makes them \"equal protagonists\".\nThe past few weeks have suggested that Neymar is good enough to merit a more elevated standing, placing him shoulder to shoulder with Messi rather than deferentially looking up to him.\nWhether Messi will be prepared to share his crown is another matter.",

    "35764233": "The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) predicted that the UK housing market will slow down over the next three months.\nIn April, landlords and second home owners face a 3% stamp duty surcharge on new purchases.\nThis would slow price rises, Rics said, but only in the short-term.\nSurveyors still expect house prices to rise by 25% over the next five years.\n\"Over the past three months, we have witnessed a surge in buy-to-let activity,\" said Simon Rubinsohn, Rics chief economist.\n\"Investors have rushed to purchase homes before the stamp duty surcharge comes into effect. It is inevitable that over the coming months, April's stamp duty changes will take a little of the heat out of the investor market.\n\"While there remain significant doubts as to whether the government's plans to encourage a more robust development and construction pipeline will be sufficient to address the housing crisis, long-term price indications for the housing market remain strong.\"\nEast Anglia saw the most widespread house price rises in February, Rics suggested.\nOther surveys have suggested a pick-up in activity by landlords ahead of the stamp duty rises, but there is some disagreement among commentators over what effect this is having on the UK housing market as a whole.\nVarious surveys record UK house prices on a monthly basis, but they all have slightly different methodology.\nThe house price index by the Nationwide Building Society is the quickest to be released. It uses an average value for properties after considering components such as location and size. The survey is based on its own mortgage lending which represents about 13% of the market.\nA survey by the Halifax, now part of Lloyds Banking Group, is published a few days later. Lloyds is the biggest mortgage lender in the UK with 20% of the market and, like the Nationwide, uses its own home loan data.\nFigures from the Land Registry are widely considered to be the most robust but are published much later than the lenders' data. It calculates the price change for properties that have sold multiple times since 1995. This survey only covers England and Wales.\nA survey is of house prices in Scotland is published by the Registers of Scotland, using a simple average of house prices. The Land and Property Services assisted by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency produces a quarterly house price index in Northern Ireland.\nThe official UK statistical authority - the Office for National Statistics - is another well-regarded survey, used for reference by government. It offers a UK-wide regional breakdown. It draws on data from the regulated mortgage survey by the Council of Mortgage Lenders, so excludes cash buyers of property.\nHousing market sentiment is reflected in the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) survey of some of its members.\nVarious other surveys include a Hometrack review of house prices in UK cities, and a Rightmove survey of asking prices.",
    "35228910": "Guzman, the head of the Sinaloa drugs cartel, was captured on Friday after escaping from a prison in Mexico last year, the second such breakout he's managed to pull off.\nGuzman had been charged with drug trafficking and murder. US prosecutors have said he's helped to bring more than 500 tons of cocaine into the US over the last several decades.\nHe has operated a vast drug empire that has a fleet of trucks, aeroplanes and submarines, as he told Penn in the interview, conducted while Guzman was still in hiding.\nActor Penn has been secretive about the circumstances around the interview, which was conducted while Guzman was being pursued by Mexican and American authorities, and how he managed to secure it in the first place. He says he was put in touch with the drug lord through the Mexican actress Kate del Castillo, who was in talks with Guzman about a biopic.\nIn his Rolling Stone piece, Mr Penn talked about the use of burner phones and other methods used to escape detection by authorities.\nMany people have wondered whether Mr Penn broke the law with his reporting - and whether or not he could be prosecuted.\nBut legally, it is OK to talk to someone when they are a fugitive from justice?\n\"Simply having contact with a known narco-trafficker is not the basis of prosecution,\" said Daniel Richman, a professor of law at Columbia University and a former federal prosecutor.\nBut if Mr Penn had helped Guzman in some way to avoid capture - or interfered with the authorities' efforts to find him - he could be prosecuted.\nThere don't seem to be signs that Mr Penn is guilty of that, or that authorities in the US or Mexico will file criminal charges against him.\nIn the past, authorities have decided not to go after journalists or former officials who have interviewed notorious figures.\nOsama Bin Laden spoke to journalist Robert Fisk for a series of interviews, and to former US justice department official John Miller in 1998 for an ABC News report.\nNeither Mr Fisk nor Mr Miller was prosecuted. A senior intelligence official told the BBC that in a similar way it's unlikely that Mr Penn will be.\nYet his interview has made people uncomfortable, especially given Guzman's history of violence.\n\"It may be immoral,\" said Stanford Law School's Robert Weisberg, describing Penn's journalistic work. \"But it's not illegal.\"\nCaleb Mason, a former federal prosecutor who used to work on drug-smuggling cases, said Mr Penn was unlikely to be prosecuted in Mexico, either.  \"He was just doing an interview,\" said Mason. \"Mexican law is pretty protective of journalistic rights.\"\nStill, Mexican authorities have made it clear they would like to talk to Mr Penn - though they haven't said anything publicly about prosecuting him.\nAs Cesar Diaz, a former senior special agent who worked on investigations of Pablo Escobar, a Colombian drug trafficker, said: \"If I was a Mexican authority, I would want to know: How in the heck did Sean Penn know where El Chapo was and we didn't?\"",

    "24037309": "The Old Trafford outfit, who are unbeaten in the Championship all season, have secured an immediate return to the top tier with two games left to play. They need just 12 more points to be crowned champions.\nMark Chilton was the last Red Rose captain to achieve promotion back in 2005 and was also part of their Championship-winning side of 2011.\nThe 36-year-old assesses the key factors to Lancashire securing a return to the top flight.\nRelegation came as a surprise for Lancashire in 2012, less than 12 months after they had been crowned outright champions for the first time in 77 years. The only goal for 2013 was promotion.\n\"The challenge for that season when you're in Division Two is that it almost feels like you're not playing for anything major. It's just a case of 'we've got to get ourselves back in that top division'.\n\"I remember 2005 being a bit of a stop-gap season and I'm pretty sure the lads will have felt like that this year.\n\"It hasn't surprised me that they've been so dominant. If you had spoken to me in April, I'd have confidently said they would have been going up, more than likely as champions.\n\"Clearly, in four-day cricket, they've really played very well this year. There's lots of good things happening at the club, with lots of good people involved, and over time, more often than not it will produce good results.\"\nSix of Lancashire's eight home Championship fixtures in 2013 have been played at Old Trafford, compared with just two in 2012, following the completion of a multi-million pound redevelopment at the county's traditional home.\n\"I do think it's made a significant difference.\n\"Liverpool became a bit of a fortress for us in 2011 but having the home comforts of the new stadium, which is a fantastic facility and a lovely place to be, has probably really helped to settle the side.\n\"They've started to create the same feeling that we had at Liverpool in 2011, in that it becomes a difficult place to play.\n\"There would have been a lot of people holding their breath this summer. It was a big moment for the club because an awful lot of work had been done to get to that stage.\n\"To see the ground full for a Test match and a one-day international match [both against Australia] is what a lot of people have worked hard towards. They can sit back and take a great deal of satisfaction from a job well done.\"\nWith 122 Test appearances between them for South Africa and Australia respectively, Ashwell Prince and Simon Katich have brought some much-needed experience to Lancashire's batting line-up and are their top two run scorers in four-day cricket.\n\"Simon is probably  The times I've seen him, he's looked very fluent and has scored a great volume of runs.\n\"I got the chance to play with Ashwell and I know what a determined performer he is.\n\"You're always guaranteed runs with those two guys. You'll very rarely put them into a situation that they've not played out before, so they can play lots of different roles and also complement the other guys in the team.\"\nThe evergreen Glen Chapple and the rejuvenated Kyle Hogg have both taken more than 50 first-class wickets for Lancashire in 2013, their stand-out performance coming in June when they dismissed Essex for just 20.\n\"After starting with successive home draws, Lancashire's campaign burst into life with a dramatic win against Glamorgan at Colwyn Bay, bowling the home side out for 139.\n\"Two victories against Essex, the first coming after chasing down 253 to win on the final day at Old Trafford, and then bowling Essex out for just 20 at Chelmsford, were remarkable achievements and big highlights.\n\"Once they picked up their first win, they never really looked back. With a trio of bowlers claiming more than 50 wickets apiece and runs coming from throughout the team, Lancashire are worthy of promotion in 2013.\"\n\"I've known Glen a long time and he looks as fit as I've seen him for a long time. The important thing for him is to keep his body in a good shape so that he can go out and demonstrate those skills.\n\"If you ask the majority of opening batsmen their top three hardest opponents, he will be in most people's top three. He's very well respected and\n\"The partnership between Glen and Kyle was a real strength in 2011, and\n\"Similarly to finding a good opening partnership with the bat, exactly the same thing applies with the ball.\n\"Where they're very strong is that they don't give much to hit. They're always testing techniques early on, always asking questions and not leaking too many runs so they're putting sides under pressure straight away.\n\"They obviously enjoy bowling with each other and it's proved to be an effective partnership this year.\"\nGary Keedy had been Lancashire's front-line spinner for much of his 18 years with the county, but his pre-season departure to Surrey has allowed Simon Kerrigan to flourish in a season that ended with him being handed a Test debut by England.\n\"Simon has always been an exciting cricketer - an aggressive spin bowler who is always looking to take wickets.\n\"His  will have been up and down, but they will stand him in good stead.\n\"I really think he will go on to be a high-class international spinner. He's got all the attributes. When he's bowling well, he bowls people out and he wins games.\"\nLancashire have offered first-team chances to talented youngsters in recent seasons and 2013 has been no different, with opener Luis Reece, 23, making the most significant breakthrough.\n\"Luis was involved during my time and he forced his way in through the sheer volume of runs he was scoring in every form of cricket he was playing. It's very hard to ignore that.\n\"He's got his game organised and he's shown himself to be a consistent performer.\n\"I've done it myself - if you can bat a long time, see off the new ball and bat out that first session, you're setting a platform for the team to get big runs. He's done that brilliantly.\"",

    "32719657": "Research from the Institute for Policy Studies found that in 2014, bonuses paid to Wall Street employees had been double the annual pay earned by all Americans who worked full-time at the federal minimum wage.\nSo, 167,800 Wall Street employees were paid $28.5bn (\u00a318.2bn) in bonuses, while 1,007,000 full-time minimum wage earners made about $14bn.\nOne particularly eye-catching blog on the subject carried the headline: \"If You Own a Pitchfork, You Will Grab It When You See This Chart\".\nI wondered if this statistic was also true in the UK.\nThe best proxy we have for the Wall Street bonus pool is the ONS figure for bonuses paid in the finance and insurance sector, the most recent figure for which was \u00a314.4bn in the financial year 2013-14.\nThe Low Pay Commission says that excluding apprenticeships there were 1.3 million jobs in 2014 that paid the National Minimum Wage (NMW) of which 40% were full-time, so that's about 520,000 jobs.\nAssuming everyone earned the highest level of minimum wage, the average level of the NMW for 2013-14 was \u00a36.25.\nIf we assume that they worked 37.5 hours a week (that's the average number of full-time hours given in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings for 2014) and that they work 48 weeks a year, their total earnings come to \u00a35.9bn, which is less than half the amount paid in bonuses by the finance and insurance sector - it's about 40%.\nBefore you go and buy a pitchfork, remember that there are differences between this figure and the US one. For example, the bonuses in the UK finance and insurance sector were shared between more than a million employees - considerably more than on Wall Street. There were people paid very high bonuses but also people paid much more modest ones. The average overall was \u00a313,300, but I would expect that to mask quite a range.\nBut the other question is, what is this an indicator for and what would make it rise or fall?\nSo, for example, imagine that 100,000 people earning minimum wage suddenly received a pay rise of \u00a31 an hour. They would no longer be earning minimum wage, so the total amount paid to workers on the minimum wage would fall considerably and as a result the amount paid out in bonuses would be a higher multiple of it. But it would be hard to argue that their pay rise had increased inequality.\nNonetheless, if you were outraged by the figure from the US then you will be just as outraged that the same appears to be true in the UK.",

In recent years the country has seen buildings shaped like a teapot and another resembling a pair of trousers.\nNow, China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce has continued the government's crusade for normalcy with restrictions on such names as 'scared of wife' or 'prehistoric powers'.\nSo, just how weird and wonderful are Chinese company names? Well, a few otherwise-unoccupied social media users in China have dug up some gems.\nSome curiosities have crept into business names from internet memes.\n\"Shenyang Prehistoric Powers Hotel Management Limited Company\" might sound weird but less so to Chinese sports fans who remember swimmer Fu Yuanhui.\nShe famously won a bronze medal at the Rio Olympics, afterwards declaring: \"I have used all my prehistoric powers to swim!\"\nThere are also lots of restaurants and cafes with the phrase \"skinny blue mushroom\".\nThe phrase originated from a meme which mocked a man from Guangxi province who uploaded a video of himself talking about his loneliness while his girlfriend was away.\n\"Unbearable, I want to cry,\" he moaned - but thanks to his accent, it ended up sounding more like \"skinny blue mushroom\".\nOne of the best known offbeat names on Chinese social media is a condom company called \"Uncle Niu\".\nOr, more accurately, \"There Is a Group of Young People With Dreams, Who Believe They Can Make the Wonders of Life Under the Leadership of Uncle Niu Internet Technology Co Ltd.\"\nIt's not concise, but at least it's positive.\nOthers aren't so upbeat, especially when it comes to home life.\nAnd given \"Beijing Scared of Wife Technology Company\" and \"Anping County Scared of Wife Netting Products Factory\" are both registered companies, the trend doesn't seem to be limited by industry or region.\nThe rules of written Chinese are vastly different to those of written English, so many names seem far stranger in translation than in the original tongue.\nEnglish names can seem pretty strange in Chinese too, and there's a cottage industry among branding agencies to help western companies come up with names for the Chinese market.\nWestern company names often follow the name of their founder (think Boeing, Ford or Gucci), which might have no direct translation.\nOr they might be a concocted portmanteau (think Verizon, which is the Latin word \"veritas\" meaning truth, with horizon bolted on to the end) or maybe even just tech nonsense (Etsy, Hulu).\n\"What we think is most important to come up with a name that captures the spirit of the brand,\" says Tait Lawton, from Nanjing Marketing Group, which provides naming services.\nWestern companies sometimes try to phonetically replicate the original, or come up with a Chinese name that's fairly neutral in meaning.\nOthers will come up with a new name that tries other ways of encapsulating the brand.\n\"BMW's current Chinese name is \u5b9d\u9a6c.

And still does, it's just that he momentarily lost it along the way.\n\"In the end it was so easy for me as an amateur,\" says Gavin, who missed out on the 2008 Olympics after failing to make the weight but remains the only British boxer to win a world amateur title.\n\"I won my last 50 fights, everything was done for me at GB Boxing in Sheffield and when you're part of a team you can help each other. But when you turn pro you're on your own. I didn't realise how lonely it would be.\"\nAn unhappy boxer tends to be an underperforming boxer and loneliness exacerbated by personal turmoil made Gavin a very unhappy boxer indeed.\n\"I took my family up to Manchester and it was all right for a bit,\" says the 28-year-old. \"But when I split up from my girlfriend I was doing it all on my own. And I was even lonelier.\"\nBesides his relationship ending in acrimonious circumstances, Gavin's grandmother died and his mother was diagnosed with cancer. In addition, Gavin felt unloved by some of those charged with guiding his career.\n\"I remember almost falling over in front of one trainer,\" says Gavin, \"and he said: 'I'm glad you didn't go over, that might have been my investment gone, my 10%.' It made me think.\n\"I was on the brink of giving it all up. I said to Frank Warren: 'I'll get back in touch if I want to box again.'\"\nSitting next to Gavin, with his eyes wide open and his ears cocked, is his old team-mate Anthony Ogogo, a bronze medallist at the London Olympics.\nOgogo, on the books of American giants Golden Boy Promotions, is three fights into his pro career and as bushy-tailed as boxers come. But even he is becoming pitted by the game's hard truths.\n\"I've never seen anyone as talented as Frankie,\" says the 24-year-old. \"So it's weird to think it could have been all over almost before it started.\n\"Then again, you hear so many horror stories in boxing - strife with promoters, trainers or managers. It's a hard enough game without all that so you need to know you've got the right people around you. People you can trust.\"\nYou hear so many horror stories in boxing - strife with promoters, trainers or managers. It's a hard enough game without all that.\nBoxers are wont to blame everyone but themselves for their lack of progress. So it is refreshing to hear Gavin admitting his own mistakes and that he has taken steps to rectify them. Starting with getting the right people around him. People he can trust.\n\"I got complacent because it all seemed too easy again, starting out in the pro ranks,\" says Gavin. \"I thought all I had to do was box - pads, spar, pads, spar. But you've got to work on your weaknesses as well as your strengths.\n\"Fighters I should have been smashing up I was having hard fights against, like Curtis Woodhouse. But when I went back to Birmingham my old amateur trainer, Tom Chaney, took over again.\n\"He's like a father figure to me. He doesn't nag me for money if I don't pay him on time - he's not in it for money, he's in it for me.\"\nHead settled and body a temple once more, Gavin is now the British and Commonwealth welterweight champion and confident enough to be calling out Kell Brook and Amir Khan.\nDeGale, too, is \"older and wiser\". Free of hangers-on, less bombastic but painfully aware he remains lumbered with something of an image problem.\n\"I learned a whole heap from my loss against George Groves,\" says DeGale of his only pro defeat, by his bitter domestic rival in 2011.\n\"During the build-up I was a bit too vocal, telling him he was ugly and his breath smelt. Maybe I shouldn't have said that.\n\"I read and hear people saying I'm flash and cocky and it does hurt a bit. Maybe it's just me being me. But the people who know me realise I'm a genuine, humble, down-to-earth boy.\"\nOgogo may have his eyes wide open and both ears cocked - \"James and Frankie have made mistakes I don't want to make\" - but the chain of advice is unbroken from the time men first laced up gloves and the same mistakes get made. Over and over again.\nProof that professional boxing isn't a sport, it isn't a business, it's a series of accidents - rather than mistakes - just waiting to happen.\n\"I get a lot of stick,\" says DeGale, a former British and European super-middleweight champion and one or two fights away from a world title shot.\n\"People telling me I'm greedy, that I'm always thinking about money, that I've messed up my career. But they don't understand. I love boxing, but it's hard, it's a short career and I want to get paid as much as I can and get out with my faculties intact.\n\"I tell young fighters who train with me: 'Get in there, make some money and run.'\" Which almost never happens. Not even if you turn up for your first day of work with a medal round your neck.\n\"It's always there,\" says DeGale, \"I'm always 'James Degale, Olympic champion'. But another Olympics comes around, new medallists arrive and they start taking the limelight.\" Leaving the old guard cynical and contorted, seemingly overnight.",

The other costs covered training, accommodation, meals, welfare, health, salary and other support per Army recruit in 2010-11.\nArmy personnel can be deployed once they turn 18 - which the two groups said meant that \"at any one time, approximately 150 soldiers are fully trained but too young to be deployed.\"\nThey added that it costs approximately \u00a32.65m to pay the salaries of these un-soldiers, which it said were each paid a salary of \u00a317,690.\nThe report said the drop-out rate for minors was 36.6% compared with 28.3% for adults, the report said.\nBut it added that under-18s who completed their training were likely to serve for an average of 10 years, compared with seven-and-a-half years for adult recruits.\nThe report suggested taxpayers would save between \u00a381.5m and \u00a394m if all recruits were aged 18 and over.\nIts authors also say the UK is becoming \"increasingly isolated\" internationally in continuing with the practice - no other country in Europe recruits from such a young age - and are calling on the MoD to raise the Army recruitment age to 18.\nDavid Gee, of ForcesWatch, said recruiting under-18s into the Army was \"a practice from a bygone era\".\n\"It's not just young recruits who pay the price for outdated MoD policies - taxpayers do too,\" he said.\n\"And so does the Army when it finds itself undermanned on the front line because so many minors have dropped out of training.\"\nAn MoD spokesman said it continued \"to actively recruit across all age groups\".\n\"As part of our duty of care to our recruits, no young person under the age of 18 years may join our armed forces without the formal written consent of their parent or guardian,\" he added.\n\"There are currently no plans to revisit the government's recruitment policy for under-18s, which is fully compliant with United Nations conventions.\"\nOne former serviceman said that joining the armed forces as a teenager was \"a good thing for young people\".\nJason Hardick, from Maidenhead, Berkshire, told the BBC: \"It gives you self-confidence, self-discipline and a certain self-determination.

In other animals with similar anatomy, this requires the teeth to be replaced due to wear and tear.\nThe team members said they can now begin testing this theory and others regarding the dinosaur's biology and behaviour.\nFollow Paul on Twitter.",

Her cancer is now in remission.\nFollowing a three-week trial in a Missouri state court, she was awarded $5m in compensatory damages and $50m in punitive damages.\nJere Beasley, whose firm represents Ms Ristesund, said his client was gratified with the verdict. The jury's decision should \"end the litigation\", he said, and force J&J to settle the remaining cases.\nAnalysis: James Gallagher, health editor, BBC news website\nIs talc safe?\nThere have been concerns for years that using talcum powder, particularly on the genitals, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer.\nBut the evidence is not conclusive. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc used on the genitals as \"possibly carcinogenic\" because of the mixed evidence.\nWhy is there any debate?\nThe mineral talc in its natural form does contain asbestos and does cause cancer. However, asbestos-free talc has been used in baby powder and other cosmetics since the 1970s. But the studies on asbestos-free talc give contradictory results.\nIt has been linked to a cancer risk in some studies, but there are concerns that the research may be biased as the studies often rely on people remembering how much talc they used years ago. Other studies have argued there is no link at all and there is no link between talc in contraceptives such as diaphragms and condoms (which would be close to the ovaries) and cancer.\nAlso, there does not seem to be a \"dose-response\" for talc, unlike with known carcinogens like tobacco where the more you smoke, the greater the risk of lung cancer.\nThe charity Ovacome says there is no definitive evidence and that the worst-case scenario is that using talc increases the risk of cancer by a third.\nBut it adds: \"Ovarian cancer is a rare disease, and increasing a small risk by a third still gives a small risk. So even if talc does increase the risk slightly, very few women who use talc will ever get ovarian cancer.\"\nA J&J spokeswoman said the verdict contradicted 30 years of research supporting the safety of cosmetic talc.\nCarol Goodrich said the company intends to appeal and will keep defending its products' safety.\nThe case follows another one in February, in which Johnson & Johnson was ordered to pay $72m to the family of a woman who claimed her death was linked to use of the company's Baby Powder talc.\nJackie Fox from Birmingham, Alabama died of ovarian cancer last year, aged 62, having used the talc for decades.\nHer family argued that the firm knew of talc risks and failed to warn users.\nJ&J is appealing against that verdict, which sparked renewed interest in talc-powder lawsuits. Lawyers accuse J&J of failing to warn that talc was linked to an increased risk for ovarian cancer - a claim J&J denies.

So we are going to restrict it as a party,\" he says.\nSales have been slowly growing for Yedu Nesu, the company behind the House of Gushungo, though it is reluctant to discuss profits made so far.\nT-shirts, costing between $10 (\u00a36.50) and $15, umbrellas, berets and even sports clothes bearing the liberation leader's signature sold out at a stall in Gweru during the Zanu-PF conference in December.\nAway from Zanu-PF events though, it is hard to find anywhere to buy the products as the company does not have an official outlet, although it says it is moving soon to a shop in central Harare.\nRobert Mugabe: The survivor\nIts most recent accessory is a cap with 1924 - the year of Mr Mugabe's birth - imprinted on it, which was released in time for the president's birthday celebrations last month.\nJustin Matenda, Yedu Nesu's chief executive, says the Zanu-PF leader himself gave the blessing for the signature branding when asked - and has no shares in the venture.\n\"He was overwhelmed,\" said the 29-year-old businessman, who heads a three-man team.\nThey design and market the products and outsource the manufacturing.\n\"Yedu Nesu has the sole rights to market, distribute and manufacture the brand\u2026 the Robert Mugabe regalia,\" he said.\n\"The president does not want to make money,\" said Mr Matenda, explaining that the understanding was that once the fashion company began to make a profit, some of it would go a humanitarian cause.\nZanu-PF may see the label as a way to woo urban young trendy voters as it traditionally garners most of its support in rural areas.\nMetropolitan hubs are the heartlands for the Movement for Democratic Change, whose leader Morgan Tsvangirai is set to challenge Mr Mugabe once more in this year's presidential election.\nAppealing to voters born after independence in 1980, when Mr Mugabe came to power, and who did not experience life under white-minority rule, is a challenge for Zanu-PF.\nAt the moment it is mainly middle-aged people who can be spotted in Harare sporting the R G Mugabe clothes line.\nMr Tsvangirai's spokesman Luke Tamborinyoka told the BBC that: \"The Mugabe fashion craze is a desperate attempt by his brand managers to catch the young voters.\n\"It's an attempt to seduce the young, first-time voters who are believed to be almost a million - a very big number considering Zimbabwe's voting population.\"\nBut he said he did not think the designer clothes would make any difference to the way people vote.\n\"No amount of fashion labels will save him in the next election.\"\nYouth appeal is also the goal for House of Gushungo.\nSaint Mahaka, the label's designer, gives an insight into their strategy.\n\"The young guys are into fashion. They talk about label, label, label... he [Mugabe] is already a brand himself.\n\"We decided, there is Versace, there is Polo, there is Tommy Hilfiger, people are putting on these labels, but don't know who they are and what the story is.\n\"We know President Mugabe's story, we know who he is.\n\"And those who resonate with his story and what he stands for - there is something only for the older guys but for the young guys as well.\"\nMoses Donsa-Nkomo, who teaches intellectual property law at the University of Zimbabwe, says Yedu Nesu may risk a political backlash if it attempts to register the brand without permission from Zanu-PF.\nThe House of Gushungo team says their business is driven by a desire to ensure Mr Mugabe's legacy, not by avarice.\nWhile many people accuse Mr Mugabe of wrecking what was once one of Africa's most diversified economies, his supporters argue that he is standing up for the rights of black Zimbabweans against the powers of colonialism - and the designer clothes are part of that battle.\n\"We all came from families that went through the liberation struggle,\" says Mr Matenda.\n\"Our upbringing has been mentored by the concept and principles of empowerment and upholding the ideals of black Zimbabweans,\" he said.\n\"We are just there to propel his identity, to maintain his legacy.\"",

    "36463668": "Its fossils indicate that the normal-sized primitive humans who first set foot on the Indonesian island of Flores shrank \"rapidly\" to become Hobbit-sized.\nThe remains are of at least one adult and two children, who are all just as small as their descendents.\nA paper in the journal Nature details the latest findings.\nThe Hobbit's discovery in a cave on Flores created a sensation 12 years ago. Just a metre in height (hence the affectionate nickname), it was initially thought they could have been living as recently as 12,000 years ago.\nSubsequent analysis has shown they actually existed slightly further back in time, between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago - not that this lessened the fascination with the diminutive species more properly called Homo floresiensis.\nAnd now comes new research from some of the scientists involved in the original discovery that reveals insights on the Hobbit's lineage.\nThe team presents much older fossils, dating back 700,000 years, unearthed at a site named Mata Menge.\nThese remains consist of a piece of lower jawbone and several teeth. They are remarkably similar to those of the Hobbit find in 2004 and are thought to belong to the ancestors of floresiensis.\nThere are also stone tools at the same site which are much older still, suggesting ancient human-like creatures lived on Flores a million years ago. One theory is that these people were another normal-sized species we now refer to as Homo erectus, which was known to live on the island of Java, about 500 km west of Flores.\nAccording to Dr Yousuke Kaifu, from Tokyo's National Museum of Nature and Science, the discovery of the tiny 700,000 year old hobbit ancestor suggests that erectus might have shrunk within the space of just 300,000 years, which is a remarkably short period in evolutionary terms.\n\"What is truly unexpected is that the size of the finds indicates that Homo floresiensis had already obtained its small size by at least 700,000 years ago.\"\nDr Gert van den Bergh, from the University of Wollongong's Centre for Archaeological Science, who led the team, said the entire team was surprised at the small size of the adult jawbone.\n\"We were expecting to find something larger than what we found, something closer to the size of the original founder population,  Homo erectus, but it turns out that they were as small if not smaller than Homo floresiensis.\n\"The rapid evolution seems quite fast but we have no examples of human or primates (shrinking) on other islands to compare it to.\"\nThe theory is that erectus shrank to cope with the Island's relatively meagre resources. But the big question is how did it get there. Homo erectus was too primitive to build boats and it was too far for the species to swim from Java to Flores. One possibility, is that individuals were swept across by a giant tidal wave, according to the researchers.\nBut Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London believes that the evidence for the rapid shrinking theory is circumstantial: \"We do not know how large the tool-makers at one million years actually were, since we do not have their fossils yet; and, secondly, we cannot be sure that the evidence at one million years actually represents the first arrival of humans on Flores.\"\nHe added: \"It is just as likely that the ancestors of (The Hobbit) came from somewhere like Sulawesi, to the North, and we have no evidence so far of who might have been there more than a million years ago.\"\nThe researchers acknowledge that their argument is based on scant data: one fragment of a jawbone and a handful of teeth. But Dr Adam Brum of Griffiths University in Australia says the team hopes to gather more fossils to build up a more complete picture.\n\"We want to know what the very, very first (humans) that set foot on the island were like. That involves finding the fossils that date back to before a million years ago and which go with the stone tools.\"\nDr van den Bergh added that the discovery of Hobbit-like humans living on Flores 700,000 years ago ruled out the possibility that the discovery in 2004 was of a group of modern humans who had been stunted by illness.\n\"This find quashes once and for all any doubters that believe Homo floresiensis was merely a sick modern human.\"\nFollow Pallab on Twitter",

    "24535799": "Threatened by deforestation and poaching to supply the black market trade in tiger body parts, it is one of the most endangered cats on the planet.\nBut over the past decade or so, a new threat has emerged - a silent, insidious one - canine distemper virus.\nWorldwide there are an estimated 400-500 Siberian or Amur tigers.\nExact numbers are hard to determine because this is a reclusive animal that is rarely observed.\nYet, at the turn of the century, some of these otherwise withdrawn animals were seen wandering onto roads and into villages in the Russian Far East. They were fearless and docile, confused and dazed; the antithesis of their usual ferocious and wary demeanour.\nOver the next few years evidence mounted that this, the largest living felid, was suffering from an infectious agent and the indications - the nature of the illness, historical understanding of wild cat infections and the diagnosis, in a single wild tiger, of a virus belonging to the morbillivirus genus - provided a likely culprit.\nA study published in the journal mBio, confirmed these suspicions. Genetic analysis of several dead tiger samples showed that canine distemper virus was the cause.\nCanine distemper virus (CDV), a relative of the human measles virus, was first described in dogs and infection causes fatal pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain).\nBut this virus is incredibly promiscuous and can infect jump into a variety of different animals - usually with catastrophic effects.\nTwo suspected CDV outbreaks, the first in 1988 and a second in 2000, killed thousands of Baikal then Caspian seals.\nThe virus has also ripped through Africa, with fatal outbreaks in silver-backed jackals and bat-eared foxes and catastrophic die-offs in wild dog populations that continue to this day.\nFor years, cats were thought resistant to CDV. Yes, domestic cats could be infected in the laboratory, but this was inefficient and the virus was unable to pass from one animal to another.\nA massive demise in 1994 of African lions living in the Serengeti national park in Tanzania showed that this was fallacy. This population of closely monitored lions succumbed to CDV. Whilst only 34 lion deaths were documented during the outbreak, this was only the tip of the iceberg.\nBefore CDV struck, the lion population numbered 3,000, but afterwards this had fallen by a third. In the same outbreak, countless hyenas, bat-eared foxes and leopards also perished.\nAdd to this the recent report of infection of large numbers of South American jaguar and it is evident that this virus has little, if any respect for the so-called species barrier - the unique inherent host factors and properties that prevent viruses from jumping from one species to another.\nIn an intriguing turn of events, CDV was also starting to spark fatal outbreaks in various primates.\nSo what should we make of the emergence of CDV infection in primates. Is this an indication of the potential for a more compelling species jump? Could CDV do the unthinkable and infect humans?\nThe simple answer is a resounding yes. At least, in theory it is.\nTo replicate, a virus has to get into a host cell.  It does this through interactions between proteins on its surface with proteins - receptors - on the surface of the cell. These receptors act as gateways into the cell and if the virus protein fits then infection takes place.\nDifferent animals possess slightly different versions of these receptors on their cells so the virus proteins also have to change to be able to unlock them.\nA single mutation in one of surface proteins in CDV present in primates is all it takes for the virus to successfully use the human receptor. This is a tiny species barrier.\nBut before banishing the pet dog to a high containment kennel then donning personal protective clothing before you go near, there's a key part of the story we need to consider - one that's probably been protecting us for all of these years.\nWhen you're exposed to a virus your body recognises it as foreign and your blood cells generate antibodies which bind to the virus surface proteins and protect us from infection. It's the basis for vaccination.\nFortunately, the surface protein of the measles virus is so similar to CDV that antibodies generated by the measles vaccine also protect against CD; and other morbilliviruses too.\nBut, if we ever eradicate measles and stop vaccination, maybe then we will be susceptible to CDV.\nBut what of the Amur tiger - will CDV ensure its ultimate demise?\nAs Dr Denise McAloose, lead author on the mBio paper, explained: \"When you're talking about four to five hundred animals and your losing reproductive females and their offspring, the overall impact on populations is huge.\n\"Some of the earlier modelling work, if it were to pan out, does suggest that this is a significant disease even at the levels of disease we are detecting now, which is probably just the tip of the iceberg.\"\nA bleak outlook that is shared by a University of Nottingham colleague, veterinary virologist Dr Rachael Tarlinton: \"Because they are such tiny populations even relatively small mortality events can seriously harm their genetic diversity and this might just be enough to push them over the edge.\"\nHopefully it's not too late. We know that CDV vaccines work and a targeted vaccination programme might just pull Amur tigers back from the brink.\nCurrent CDV vaccines have to be injected - no trivial task when the animal you want to protect is so difficult to track down and so dangerous to handle.\nBut not all vaccines need to be injected - some very effective vaccines have been developed for oral delivery and these have been pivotal in our fight against rabies.\nIn the late 1970s, Switzerland pioneered the widespread deployment of enticing baits laced with rabies vaccine that would be eaten by rabies-susceptible wild animals, thereby protecting them.\nSo successful was this approach that following a similar campaign that spanned more than two decades, Germany was declared rabies-free.\nWhilst development of an oral vaccine is scientifically feasible, it is unlikely ever to become a reality. As Dr Tarlinton explains: \"It was worth developing the oral bait vaccines for rabies because of the human zoonosis risk, but something for a purely veterinary disorder, particularly one that infects wildlife rather than livestock? It's difficult to justify the economics of doing it, even if we should.\"\nEven though vaccinating tigers is unfeasible there is an alternative: identify the reservoir and remove the virus at source through vaccination campaigns. This has proven very effective in protecting CDV-threatened lion populations in Africa.\nBut do we know what the reservoir is? Domestic dogs have been implicated in all epidemics involving wildlife but, because the virus can infect other animals, you have to be sure.\nAnd this is what Dr McAloose and her colleagues have turned their attention to.\n\"We have to understand if there's a reservoir.\n\"We're trying to identify how the virus is cycling through the system to understand what the carriers are, and only with these results would we be able to make the appropriate recommendations.\"\nFor the sake of the Amur tigers, I wish them well in their quest.",

    "39037490": "It follows claims of cronyism within the land and environmental services department.\nA long-running internal investigation has been looking at a number of issues, including alleged procurement irregularities.\nThe department's executive director resigned last November.\nPolice Scotland said their inquiries were at an early stage.\nBBC Scotland understands officers have taken an interest in issues that arose through Glasgow City Council's internal investigation and that the local authority would be willing to co-operate with police.\nIt is also understood that a meeting took place recently between the council and police and that some of the issues spoken about involved people outside the council.\nThe land and services department looks after services such as cleansing, bin collection, park, roads to environmental health and trading standards.\nThe department has about 4,000 employees and a revenue budget of \u00c2\u00a3190m.\nIn November 2016 its executive director Brian Devlin - whose salary was about \u00c2\u00a3120,000 - resigned after five years in the role.\nIt is understood that Mr Devlin was spoken to during the internal investigation.\nThe others interviewed by the internal investigators included two members of staff with close personal links to housing repair company Mears Scotland, which had also been at the centre of a local controversy over council contracts in neighbouring North Lanarkshire.\nOne is the son of its managing director who is married to Glasgow's Lord Provost Sadie Docherty.\nThe other is the partner of an executive with Mears who is now working in a different role at the council.\nHowever, Mears currently has no major contracts with Glasgow City Council and the company has denied wrongdoing.\nA spokesman for Labour-run Glasgow City Council said it would not be appropriate to comment on an ongoing internal investigation.\nThe broader issue of openness and transparency within Glasgow City Council is set to be a key theme in the campaign ahead of May's local elections.\nSupporters of the Labour administration may argue that the internal investigation demonstrates that they take such matters seriously.\nHowever, the SNP believe that, in general, the council could do more to ensure it is transparent and seen to be so.\nThe leader of the SNP group on the council, Susan Aitken, stressed she did not wish to comment on this specific investigation or any of the individuals concerned.\nHowever, she said: \"Glasgow SNP have already expressed serious concerns about public trust in the council in the light of a number of incidents over the years and have committed to appoint an independent expert to conduct a root and branch review of governance if elected.\"\nThe Times newspaper, which first reported the story in its Scottish edition, claimed the council's ties with Mears and a number of other firms were being looked at by the local authority's internal auditors.\nIn general, councils are expected to follow tight procurement rules and statutory procedures to ensure an open and transparent process is followed for any contract being awarded - major contracts also have to comply with EU law.\nThey should not be awarded on the basis of personal connections and no company tendering for a contract should be given an unfair advantage or disadvantage.\nIt would be seen as bad practice - and possibly a breach of rules - for anyone with a close personal connection to a company to be involved with decisions on whether or not they are awarded a contract.\nAny allegation a council employee was able to give one company bidding for work an unfair advantage, through for instance sharing information, would also be taken very seriously.\nRecommendations on who to award significant contracts to are made by council officials, although the actual decisions are taken by committees of councillors. It is unusual for these committees to go against the officials' recommendations.\nPolice Scotland said: \"A matter has been raised with the police and inquiries are at an early stage to assess this information.\"",

    "36344759": "The winning film, I Daniel Blake, marks the 13th time that Loach, the director of more than 50 movies, has competed at the event. It's also exactly 10 years since he won the same prize for his 2006 Irish drama The Wind That Shakes The Barley, starring Cillian Murphy.\nLoach uses I, Daniel Blake to expose the welfare system in the UK, and says he wants the film \"to break audience's hearts, but also to make them angry\".\nDaniel Blake, played by stand-up comedian Dave Johns, is an older man living in Newcastle who, because of a heart attack, can no longer do his job.\nHowever, a mobility test by the Department of Work and Pensions declares him fit for work and while he waits for his appeal, Daniel Blake can only claim Jobseekers Allowance.\nHis inability to take any work offered means his money is stopped, and he begins to go hungry.\nLoach, a social campaigner for most of his career, believes the current criteria for claiming benefits in the UK is \"a Kafka-esque, Catch 22 situation designed to frustrate and humiliate the claimant to such an extent that they drop out of the system and stop pursuing their right to ask for support if necessary\".\n\"The state's attitude is not an accident,\" he claims.\n\"The poverty, the indignity, the humiliation people go through is consciously done.\n\"The state is knowingly inefficient or cruel, knowing that people will be driven to frustration, despair, hunger and possible suicide.\n\"Claimants are portrayed as 'scroungers' in the media but research has found that less than 1% of claims for benefits are fraudulent.\n\"That's certainly less than the figures for tax evasion, for example.\n\"But there's an attitude that suggests that if you're poor, it's your fault. If you are out of a job, it's your fault. It's done to get the numbers down and the most vulnerable in our society are suffering as a result.\"\nHalf a century ago, Ken Loach wrote the screenplay for the BBC play Cathy Come Home, which examined homelessness in Britain in 1966, and the director says his latest film \"is a snapshot of how life can be lived in Britain in 2016\".\n\"We wanted to explore the human consequences of welfare policy in terms of relationships, and who people become through these policies.\"\nLoach and his long-time collaborator, writer Paul Laverty, spent several months visiting British cities such as Stoke, Newcastle, Liverpool and Glasgow, meeting people seeking work, or on low-paid or zero-hour contracts.\n\"We started in my home town of Nuneaton and met a young lad there who was sleeping on a mattress in a charity home.\n\"He was doing the odd bit of work on zero-hour contracts, he'd given up on benefits - he said it was too humiliating.\n\"He hadn't worked for a couple of weeks, and the week before he hadn't eaten for four days.\n\"I opened his fridge and there was nothing in it - nothing at all. And this was one of the first people we encountered.\"\nLoach and Laverty say they also based a pivotal scene in the film, where a mother arrives at a food bank having not eaten for days, on a real anecdote from one of the centres they visited in Glasgow.\n\"Food banks have been praised by the state without any sense of shame at all and yet it's appalling in 2016 that people are having to make the choice between food and heating, which is common.\n\"After the war in 1945, we were desperately poor in Britain, but there is no way people would have been starving, their communities wouldn't have let them.\n\"That we now have this situation is testament to the policy of individualism that successive governments have pursued.\n\"It's shocking that we are apparently such a wealthy nation with such grotesque wealth at the top and such desperate poverty and fear at the very bottom.\"\nThe film has won widespread acclaim from critics, with Variety magazine calling it \"one of Loach's finest films, a drama of tender devastation, a work of scalding and moving relevance\".\nBut despite its concentration on the UK welfare system, Loach, who will be 80 next month, insists that the movie also applies to an international audience.\n\"There is a conscious cruelty in the way we organise our lives now which means the most vulnerable people in society, such as the disabled, are caught in this unfair situation.\n\"They are often unable to live with dignity, and instead suffer pain and deep despair.\n\"It's deeply shocking that this is happening at the heart of our world.\"\nI, Daniel Blake will be released in the UK later this year",

I hope he enjoys his retirement, he really deserves it.\n\"He's always put snooker first, been a model professional, a credit to the game and I'll see him in the legends tour this year for more battles.\n\"It is his brutal frankness about his love of winning, more than the winning itself, that takes the breath away.\"\nRead more of Ben's blog\n\"I thank him sincerely for some of the best matches and memories of my own career.

I don't think he's made the right decision to bow out.\n\"But he was a phenomenal player and a really nice bloke. When you watch someone like Hendry in action, it's an art form.\"\nFormer world champion Terry Griffiths, who once coached Hendry, added: \"I thought he should have retired a while ago but he had the belief that he could continue.\n\"He was blessed with a skill. His will and desire to win was frightening.\n\"Everybody says they want to win, but Stephen Hendry wanted to win even more.\"\nMaguire added: \"I'm shocked, I wasn't expecting that but Stephen has obvioulsy thought long and hard about it.\n\"I'm just pretty sad that he's retired.

    "39329284": "Three years after Russia annexed Crimea, a move bitterly contested by Ukraine's government, the region remains in a state of flux. It's difficult to get into, and for many people, it's difficult to know where it's going.\nAt Kiev International Airport, I hand my passport to a border guard.\n\"Purpose of visit?\" he asks.\n\"Journalism. I'm with the BBC.\"\nHe pauses. He studies my passport. He seems to be checking a list. He goes to pick up a telephone and asks a question. He does not realise I can hear.\n\"You remember that pro-Russian journalist from the BBC? Was his surname Rosenberg?\"\nAnother pause.\n\"It wasn't? OK, thanks.\" He hangs up. He stamps my passport and returns it.\n\"Welcome to Ukraine!\" he smiles.\nThose pauses at passport control are an indication of the current tension between Moscow and Kiev - a relationship clouded by enmity and suspicion.\nOur BBC team is only passing through Kiev. Our final destination is Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia three years ago.\nFor journalists based in Russia, there are faster ways of reaching the Crimean peninsula. Board a plane in Moscow and two hours later you can be in the Crimean capital Simferopol. Ukraine, however, warns foreign nationals that anyone entering \"temporarily occupied Crimea\" without Kiev's permission and without crossing an official Ukrainian border may be banned from future entry to Ukraine.\nWe're taking the longer route.\nDirect flights from Russia to Ukraine stopped in October 2015. We flew from Moscow to the Belarusian capital Minsk, then on to Kiev. Ahead of us is an eight-hour road trip to Crimea.\nFirst, we visit the Ukrainian Migration Service in Kiev to obtain the \"dozvil\" - a document issued by the Ukrainian authorities permitting travel to Crimea. Three hours later, permission slips in hand, our long car journey south begins.\nRussia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 was a watershed moment. It pushed Moscow and the West to the brink of a new cold war. Three years on we are travelling to Crimea to gauge the mood.\nIt is dark by the time we reach the final Ukrainian checkpoint before the peninsula. Ukraine does not call the Kalanchak crossing a border - officially, it is a \"control point for entry and exit\". We show our passports and dozvils. Minutes later we are waved through.\nThe no-man's land between the Ukrainian and Russian checkpoints is tiny - no more than 50m long. We stop here to change cars - our Kiev driver will turn back.  A driver from Simferopol has come to meet us.\nOn the Russian side this is called the Armyansk crossing. As far as the Russians are concerned, it is an official state border. We show passports and visas and fill out immigration cards. Our documents are in order, but we are asked to wait. The appearance here of British journalists has raised official eyebrows.\nA young man in civilian clothes approaches me. \"Come with me, please,\" he says, \"I'd like to have a chat.\"\nWe enter a small room and sit down at a table. He checks my phone to make sure I am not recording our conversation.\nThen come the questions. Lots of them.\n\"What mission have your editors set you? What will you be filming? How will you be saving your material, on computers or hard drives? What SIM card will you be using in Crimea? As the correspondent, will you be making notes each night about what you have filmed? Can you show me some of the photos on your phone? Where will you be staying? Why didn't you fly direct from Moscow?\"\nMy interrogator notes down my answers on a piece of paper. His questions are not limited to Crimea.\n\"What street do you live on in Moscow? What is the nearest Metro station to your home? What does your wife do for a living? You've been in Russia a long time. Have you ever considered applying for a Russian passport?\"\n\"My British one suits me just fine,\" I reply.\n\"What do you think of English cuisine?\" he asks, adding, \"I like Jamie Oliver. Although I consider he uses too much oil.\"\nThe questioning lasts an hour. Then the official escorts me back to the van. I ask for his name.\n\"I have no name,\" he replies, \"only a rank.\"\nThe inquisitive young man with \"no name, only a rank\" invites my colleagues for similar conversations.\nThree hours pass. Interrogations over, we are still not free to go. We spend the night in the van waiting for Russian customs officers to process our papers and allow our TV equipment through. Ten hours after arriving at the Armyansk crossing, we finally clear the checkpoint.\nSimferopol is the administrative centre of Crimea. The name of our hotel is the \"Ukraine\". But three years after annexation, the town feels Russian. Most of the cars have switched to Russian number plates, brand new buses manufactured near Moscow have taken to the roads. And, peering down from billboards is the Russian president with some of his choicest Crimea quotations - just to remind everyone who is in charge.\n\"Crimea was famous for being the spa of the Soviet Union,\" declares Vladimir Putin in one poster. \"We will, of course, develop this.\"\n\"All Russian army social programmes will be extended to Sevastopol and the Black Sea Fleet,\" he promises in another.\nNear our hotel, the wall of a building is covered with a giant painting of President Putin dressed as a sailor and the words: \"Crimea belongs to all of us\".\nAs far as retired teacher Olga Koziko is concerned, the more Putin in Crimea, the better.\n\"Crimea is a place where people support Putin,\" Olga assures me. \"We just adore him. He's our hero. I even have a T-shirt with Putin and the words: 'In Putin We Trust', like 'In God We Trust.' Thanks to Putin, Russian soldiers came to protect us.\"\nOn 22 February 2014, Ukraine's pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych fled the country after what he - and his Russian allies - called an \"illegal coup\" in Kiev. On 27 February masked men in unmarked uniforms appeared in Simferopol. Armed with Russian weapons, they seized government buildings, the parliament, the airport and blocked Ukrainian army bases. This mysterious military force picked up a variety of nicknames, including The Little Green Men and The Polite People.\nToday Moscow admits the soldiers were from Russia's secretive Special Operations Forces (the SSO). President Putin subsequently signed a decree making 27 February an annual celebration in Russia - \"Special Operations Forces Day\".\nFollowing a hastily organised referendum, it was announced that more than 95% of people who had taken part had voted for Crimea's \"reunification\" with Russia. The referendum was not recognised by the international community. To the outside world, Russia had grabbed a piece of Ukraine.\nA statue honouring The Little Green Men has been erected near the Crimean parliament building. It depicts a young girl handing flowers to a man with a gun. The inscription reads: \"To The Polite People from the grateful people of Crimea.\"\nThis is how Moscow wants to be seen here: as a force for good, protecting the people of Crimea from violent Ukrainian nationalists. In 2014 Russia's state-controlled media characterised the new Ukrainian government as \"fascists\", \"neo-Nazis\" and an \"illegitimate junta''. Olga uses similar language as she recalls the past.\n\"Without Russia, a lot of people would have been killed here,\" maintains Olga. \"Ukrainian Nazis said Crimea would either be part of Ukraine or empty. People would have been oppressed. Perhaps even put in concentration camps.\"\nThere is absolutely no evidence to substantiate Olga's claims.\nMany of those in Crimea who welcome Moscow's rule see the bloody conflict in eastern Ukraine as confirmation that Russia is a safer home. They discount evidence that unrest in the Donbass was incited and bankrolled by Moscow.\nOut on the street I get chatting to a pensioner called Nadezhda. Until recently her sister had been living in Luhansk, one of the self-proclaimed separatist republics in eastern Ukraine.\n\"Life in Luhansk is terrible,\" Nadezhda says. \"So I moved my sister to Crimea. I will do everything to make sure that kind of violence doesn't break out here.\"\nThere is another reason why Nadezhda, an ethnic Ukrainian, trusts Moscow more than Kiev - it is out of nostalgia for Soviet times, when she regarded Moscow as her capital. Nadezhda describes Crimea joining Russia as \"a return to the Soviet Union.  Our generation was, is and will always be in the USSR. We will die in the Soviet Union.\"\nNostalgia and fear are powerful feelings. But they are not enough to sustain pro-Russia sentiment in Crimea at the level of 2014.\nSevering ties to Ukraine has brought problems. With economic links to Ukraine cut, the only way of keeping the peninsula supplied is by sea or air. That means higher prices. Moscow insists that will change once it has completed a road and rail bridge linking Crimea to the Russian mainland. The bridge is a multibillion-dollar statement that Moscow is here to stay.\nAs well as higher prices, there is Russian red tape.\nI visit a document registration centre in Simferopol. More than two hundred people are queueing outside. They have come to exchange Ukrainian documents, like deeds for apartments, for Russian ones. Some people, like Alyona, have been queuing here all night.\n\"Life hasn't got better or worse,\" Alyona tells me, \"We're still standing in lines, like we always used to. Maybe some people had big expectations three years ago. But I don't believe in miracles.\"\nI ask Alyona if she could imagine Russia handing Crimea back to Ukraine.\n\"Nothing would surprise me any more,\" she laughs. \"I wouldn't be surprised if we suddenly ended up as part of Turkey. To be honest, I don't care if we're with China! The most important thing is that there is no war.\n\"I've learnt that your life can be turned upside down in a day. And there is nothing you can do about it. We're like pawns on a chessboard. They're playing with us. Today our place is in Russia. And tomorrow? Who knows. Maybe that's for the best: if we knew, we might have a heart attack.\"\nAcross town, I meet Nadia. She is complaining to me about potholes.\n\"Where I live there are potholes everywhere,\" Nadia says. \"People have been hurting their legs. I've written to the authorities asking them to do something. They haven't lifted a finger.\"\nNadia's disappointment extends further than pavements and roads.\n\"Many people here were happy, but there is disillusionment now,\" she tells me, \"because there is no investment and salaries and pensions are small. My pension is 8000 roubles ($140; \u00c2\u00a3112) a month. Just about enough to cover utility bills and the medicines I need.\"\nI am talking to Nadia beside the statue of Ukraine's most famous 19th Century poet, Taras Shevchenko. It is Shevchenko Day and a group of twenty people have come here with flowers to mark the poet's birthday. Russian police have come, too - with cameras. They are filming everyone, including us. In Russian Crimea, public expressions of Ukrainian pride attract special attention.\nNadia is an ethnic Russian, but she is wearing a small Ukrainian flag.\n\"In my soul, Crimea is still part of Ukraine,\" Nadia tells me. \"I'm here because this statue is the last symbol of Ukraine left in Crimea.\"\nA woman called Lidiya overhears our conversation. She is furious.\n\"It was the Russian Empress Catherine the Great who built up Crimea,\" says Lidiya sternly.\n\"Well, if you're going to bring up history, we could go right back to the days of the Crimean khans,\" retorts Nadia.\nLidiya switches to modern history.\n\"Three years ago America was planning to station soldiers in three schools in Sevastopol,\" she claims. \"Nato troops wanted to be in Sevastopol. Crimea would have been wiped from the face of the earth.\"\n\"How do you know that?\" I ask.\n\"I read it in the internet,\" she replies.\n\"Does that make it true?\"\nLidiya changes tack.\n\"If people think they live badly in Crimea today, let them go and live in the Donbass in eastern Ukraine. They will be crying to come back here.\"\nWe drive to the town of Bakhchysarai in central Crimea to meet Umer Ibragimov. Umer, a Crimean Tatar, is desperate for information about his son Ervin. In May 2016 Ervin was abducted late at night. CCTV cameras caught the moment he was seized by men in uniform and bundled into a vehicle.\n\"I've written to everyone asking for help,\" Umer tells me, \"from the bottom levels right up to the president. But there has been no information about my son.\"\nErvin Ibragimov was a member of the executive board of the World Congress of Crimean Tatars. Since annexation, the Crimean Tatar community has come under pressure. Its elected representative body, the Mejlis, which had opposed the 2014 referendum on joining Russia, has been ruled an \"extremist organisation\" and banned.\nHuman rights group Amnesty International accuses the Russian authorities of \"systematic persecution\" of Crimean Tatars. This month the European Union's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini concluded that \"the rights of the Crimean Tatars have been gravely violated\". Moscow denies the accusations.\nOver piping hot tea, Umer tells me the story of his family. In World War Two, his father had fought in the Red Army.\n\"He was wounded and came home,\" Umer says. \"Ten days later, all Crimean Tatars were deported from their homeland.\"\nIt was Josef Stalin who had ordered the deportation - an act of collective punishment and paranoia. The Soviet dictator suspected Crimean Tatars of collaborating with the Nazis. More than 230,000 people were forced on to cattle trains and transported to Central Asia.\n\"My mother and father told me later they'd be given just 15 minutes to gather their belongings,\" recalls Umer.\nUmer grew up in Soviet Uzbekistan.

    "35176615": "Two spacecraft have been ordered at a cost of roughly 550m euros (\u00c2\u00a3405m).\nThey will be built at the aerospace giant's factories in Portsmouth and Stevenage in southern England.\nInmarsat specialises in providing mobile connections to ships, planes, oil and gas platforms, and the broadcasting industry.\nThe new spacecraft will be known as the Inmarsat-6 series. They will update services currently offered in the L-band part of the radio spectrum.\nThese connections are handled today by the Inmarsat-4 series, which was launched in 2005. The expectation is that these earlier platforms will be operational until at least 2020, by which time the I-6s should be ready for lift-off.\nInmarsat's decision to place the order with Airbus is a major boost for UK space manufacturing.\nThe telecoms company is the world's biggest player in its field, and so the Airbus workers in Portsmouth and Stevenage will see the contract as a tremendous endorsement of their skills and expertise.\nIt will also be regarded as a very positive return on the strategy pursued by ministers and the UK Space Agency, who have targeted R&D investments in the telecoms sector.\nThis has seen, for example, the development of state-of-the-art digital signal processors for satellites that can channel significant bandwidth and power to specific locations on the ground at the drop of a hat.\nIn addition to being more capable than the I-4s, the I-6s will differ in two key respects.\nOne is their frequency of operation. As well as the L-band, which is where Inmarsat has many legacy services, the new satellites will carry a Ka-band payload.\nThis higher frequency part of the radio spectrum is where much of the new sector growth will occur - such as in-flight connections for aeroplanes.  Inmarsat recently launched an I-5 series of satellites. These all operate in Ka.\nThe other big difference from the I-4s, and indeed the I-5s, will be the new satellites' architecture. They will be what are called \"all-electric\" spacecraft.\nThis means they will use an ion engine to manoeuvre themselves once they come off the top of the launch rocket.\nThis is normally done with a large chemical thruster, but a significant mass saving can be made if the final orbital positioning is done using an engine that spits out a stream of charged gas.\nSuch ion engines, although extremely efficient, do however take longer to achieve the task in hand, resulting in a delay of several months to get the satellite on-station.\nThe plus side for the satellite owner is that they can use the mass saving either to select a smaller, cheaper rocket or to add additional payload capability.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

Now whether or not they've had a jolt from the outsider now, I don't know.\"\nFor a city that has had such a strong relationship with the Labour party, the changing political landscape over the past seven decades reveals a lot about the strength of feeling in the community.\nLabour has won all 18 elections since since the inception of the Stoke Central constituency, with the Conservatives coming second until 2001.\nBut although Labour enjoyed a heyday in the 1960s and 70s, their share of the vote has consistently fallen over the years down to a record low of 37% in this by-election.\nSo why did this city of proud, working class voters fall out of love with Labour?\n\"Things started to change because of a growing alienation of the people of Stoke-on-Trent from Westminster,\" says Prof Mick Temple from Staffordshire University.\n\"Industry was decimated in the 1980s - coal, steel and the Potteries.\n\"When I first came here [in the early 90s] infrastructure was poor, schools were poor and still today, unemployment is higher than the national average.\"\nFrom the closure of Shelton Steel Works - where 10,000 once worked - to the shrinking of its famous pottery industry, the people of Stoke-on-Trent have lived through some turbulent times.\nBut the bleak images of derelict factories and houses often shown by the media are not a true reflection of the passion and pride of a community that is fiercely proud of its heritage.\nData shows 6.2% of adults in Stoke Central claim unemployment benefit, far higher than the national average of 3.8%.\nIn recent years employers such as Bet365, Michelin Tyres and Goodwin have invested millions of pounds into their businesses, providing jobs for thousands of people.\nHanley's famous pottery industry is also enjoying something of a resurgence, with Emma Bridgewater investing more than \u00c2\u00a31m in its thriving ceramics factory.\nMiddleport Pottery, home of world-famous Burleigh, is in the national spotlight thanks to the success of BBC Two's The Great Pottery Throw Down.\nMillions of pounds are being spent regenerating the city.\nFor many people though, the investment has been too little, too late.\n\"The feeling is that the city has been passed by Westminster and the EU, and that is why people voted Leave so overwhelmingly,\" says Prof Temple.\n\"There are many towns in the north of England where people feel the same - areas that are ripe for UKIP.\"\nFrom 2005, the BNP and UKIP began to resonate with voters, coming fourth and fifth in that year's election and again in 2010.\nBy 2015, UKIP had won so much support its candidate Mick Harold came second to Tristram Hunt for a seat that had the lowest voter turnout in the whole of the UK.\nPub owner Tony Flackett, 69, backed Paul Nuttall in Thursday's poll.\n\"It feels sad, it's such a shame, they've worked really hard and people have come from all over the country.\n\"I've always voted for Conservatives but the last two years I voted UKIP because of Brexit and immigration.\n\"But life goes on and at least they reduced the margin.\"\nTom Wilson, 26, voted for UKIP in the by-election and said he was \"very upset\" at the result.\n\"I think Labour winning is very bad news for Stoke-on-Trent.\n\"There has been years of neglect in Stoke with money spent only on Hanley.\n\"I think only UKIP would have made a change for the people of Stoke.\"\nUKIP has made moves to appeal to former Labour voters, as well as those who formerly backed the Tories.\n\"They're more pro-State, pro-NHS. They recognise that strong nationalistic message supported by the working class,\" says Prof Temple.\nBetween the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, the non-white population doubled and there was a relatively high population of Muslims, he said.\n\"I'm not saying the response was a racist one - Stoke-on-Trent was getting less and less money from the government and the EU and the feeling was the traditional working class community was being overtaken.\n\"Many working class voters felt they could not express their views within the Labour party.\n\"The BNP and UKIP gave them a chance to say how they felt.\"\nNow Mr Snell is the town's new MP, the challenge is on for him to win back the trust of former Labour supporters and engage with new ones.\nLee Woolrich, 33, from Stoke-on-Trent, is head of client services for a digital agency but did not vote in the by-election.\n\"I'm ashamed really that I didn't use my vote, but I almost don't think I invest enough in politics to make an informed decision,\" he said.\n\"I don't think young people are engaged in politics. I think they are more so recently because of what's happened in America.\n\"I read about Paul Nuttall and some of his views and policies and I don't believe it's what we need here.\"\nMr Woolrich believes politicians need to take more of an interest in Stoke-on-Trent - he too feels the place has been forgotten and is badly represented by the media.\n\"Stoke is doing great without those kinds of ideas.\n\"I love the developments in Hanley and the cultural quarter.\n\"Stoke is showing signs of change and getting in line with cities like Manchester.\n\"On a local level, I like the direction things are going in but I don't necessarily think government in London will listen to the people of Stoke.\n\"I hate that stigma that Stoke isn't a nice place to live.\n\"It doesn't do the place justice. It's a beautiful city steeped in history.\"\nAnd Prof Temple agrees. \"It's a much more attractive place,\" he said.\n\"I've been here for 24 years, I've lived all around the world and this is the friendliest, most coherent community I've ever known.\n\"Stoke-on-Trent has an identity most places in the UK have lost.\n\"There's a very strong sense of community.

    "37130459": "The phrase \"rapid rise through the ranks\" is a standard line in profiles of political leaders. But it's rarely as speedy as in Natalie Bennett's case.\nThe Australian-born former Guardian journalist woke up on New Year's Day 2006 and decided she wanted to do something to change the world.\nAfter pondering her options (should she get involved with an NGO or the UN?) she joined the Green Party. Within six short years she had become its leader.\nThree years after that she was sharing a stage with the prime minister and other party leaders in a televised general election debate.\nHer sudden arrival on the frontline of British politics was all the more remarkable because she had never won an election, other than the one that had made her party leader.\nHer first aim when she took on the job was to insert the Green Party - routinely ignored or patronised by the mainstream media - into the national conversation.\nBut when media outlets finally began calling, on the back of a surge in support for the party, she sometimes found it difficult to get her message across in a suitably snappy way.\nHer vision for the party was to show how \"economic and environmental justice are indivisible\", she explains, \"the idea that tackling environmental problems isn't an add-on luxury\".\nIt was \"not a easy concept to get across\", she confesses. \"I still don't think I've got the 12 second soundbite. But I am going to keep working on it.\"\n\"It's a classic Shakespearean thing,\" she says of her struggles with the broadcast media. \"It's both my strength and my weakness that I answer the question.\"\nBut, she adds, \"when you get asked a stupid question, it's rather hard to know what to do at that point. And I guess I get tangled up in my desire to answer a question, even when it's a really stupid question\".\nDid she get asked a lot of stupid questions?\n\"Yes.\"\nAsked for an example, she ponders for a minute, before highlighting an interview with the BBC's very own John Humphrys, which led to her having \"to spend time, valuable peak time, explaining how the interviewer got the question wrong. And listeners don't particularly like that because it's all technical and boring and you are arguing with the interviewer but if it's entirely on the wrong track you have to\".\nShe says she has some sympathy with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has also attracted criticism for broadcast interviews in which he has deviated from the usual prepared soundbites.\n\"The focus on the individual is a problem for British politics and it's very uncomfortable when the focus is on you,\" she says, arguing that the media in continental Europe are focused more on policies than personalities and trivia.\n\"I am not complaining - you have to work within those limits,\" she adds, but she believes British politics is \"broken\" and the media must take its share of the blame.\n\"There should be some pressure on the journalist to ask better, more sensible questions,\" she argues.\nThere was nothing particularly stupid about the question that prompted her darkest moment in a radio studio, however, when she struggled over several excruciating minutes, punctuated by coughing fits, to answer a question from LBC's Nick Ferrari on her party's housing policy.\nShe was quick to hold her hands up afterwards, apologising to supporters and blaming her sub-par performance, in the heat of the general election campaign, on \"brain freeze\".\n\"That was a very tough moment. And of course you take a bit of a punch to the stomach.\n\"But then a few weeks later I was up on the leader debates, able to look David Cameron in the eye and challenge him about his failure to welcome Syrian refugees to Britain, and that was one of the best moments.\n\"My great problem on that day was that I was in no way well enough to actually be doing anything. I'd had about three and a half hours sleep and I'd been throwing up most of the night. I should have just pulled the day but that's partly a function of how we got to that point.\n\"We weren't used to getting a lot of media attention and it was very, very hard to turn media attention down.\"\nOne of Ms Bennett's proudest moments came at the end of the BBC leaders debate when she joined Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in a \"group hug\", while Labour leader Ed Miliband looked on awkwardly.\nThis felt like a watershed moment for women in politics, she says, sending out the message \"that politics can not just be 'dog eat dog', it can be people agreeing on some things and disagreeing on others but supporting each other\".\nAs a lifelong feminist, she is particularly pleased to have been told by \"lots of young women\" that they had been inspired by the \"group hug\", which she stresses had not been planned in advance.\n\"I hope and think that that moment really, in 15 years' time, 20 years' time, we might see a whole crop of MPs down the road who will reference that moment as the time they decided they were going to try and get there.\"\nMs Bennett's decision to pitch for the anti-austerity vote, positioning the Greens as a left-wing alternative to what was then Ed Miliband's Labour Party, struck a chord with idealistic young people who felt alienated by mainstream politics, and led to a surge in party membership.\nBut then Jeremy Corbyn came along and shifted Labour firmly to the left, inspiring idealistic activists to join his party in numbers the Greens could only dream about.\nHasn't the Green Party, which had a mixed set of results in May's elections, losing four councillors in England and failing to make progress in Wales but getting its best ever result in London, been crowded out of the picture by Labour?\nMs Bennett insists this is not the case, arguing that there is a \"very clear distinction\" between the Greens and Labour on a range of issues - from nuclear weapons to fracking - and that voters know exactly what they are getting when they vote Green.\nBut she is also open to the idea of a \"progressive alliance\" at the next general election, with local Green Parties potentially making electoral pacts with Labour, Plaid Cymru, the SNP or other parties who broadly share their outlook.\nShe remains a passionate advocate of electoral reform. The Green Party fielded a record number of general election candidates in 2015, standing in 93% of constituencies, and gaining more than a million votes. By rights, she argues, the party should have 25 MPs. She believes the case for scrapping what she sees as Britain's outdated first-past-the-post electoral system is gaining ground in the country.\nShe says she has had an \"amazing\" four years as leader, and has no regrets, believing the party is in better shape now, having quadrupled its membership and gained a foothold in the national debate on issues such as welfare and the economy, than when she took over.\nBut she is also keen to stress that she will not be leaving politics.\n\"I'm aiming to turn former leader into a role in its own right, to keep travelling the country, supporting local parties, doing media. Leadership is a role we can share around. It's not you become leader, that's the pinnacle, and then you disappear.\"\nAsked if she has any advice for the next leader, she says trust the party membership.\nAnything else?\n\"Work out how to answer stupid questions,\" she laughs. \"I still don't quite know the answer to that one myself.\"",

Many had become lawyers and doctors, or owned small businesses.\nTheir prosperity, further fuelled by racism, soon triggered anti-Japanese sentiment in Peru, Stephanie Moore explains.\nMs Moore, a scholar at the Japanese Peruvian Oral History Project, says after the outbreak of World War Two, the Japanese community in Peru became a target, and their assets were confiscated.\n\"In May 1940, as many as 600 houses, schools and businesses belonging to citizens of Japanese descent were burned down,\" she says.\nFollowing Japan's 1941 attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, the US government asked a dozen Latin American countries, among them Peru, to arrest its Japanese residents.\nRecords from the time suggest the US authorities wanted to take them to the US and use them as bargaining chips for its nationals captured by Japanese forces in Asia.\nMr Katsura was among the 2,200 Latin Americans of Japanese descent who were forcibly deported to internment camps in the US.\nBlanca Katsura, who is now 83 and lives in Northern California, remembers how she learned of his fate.\n\"A month after my father was detained, he sent me a letter because it was my birthday,\" she recalls.\n\"He had been taken to Panama from where they were planning to send him to the US,\" she adds.\nSix months later, Blanca Katsura's mother decided to take her three small children to the US to search for her husband.\n\"When we arrived in New Orleans after a month-long trip, they confiscated our passports and then sent us by train to the Crystal City camp.\"\nAs many as 4,000 people were interned during World War Two in this camp in Texas run by the US Immigration and Naturalization Service.\nMost of the detainees were of Japanese descent, although some German and Italian immigrants were also held there.\nIt was at Crystal City that Blanca Katsura was reunited with her father. \"I was shocked, he had lost so much weight,\" she remembers.\nFor the next four years, her family lived in the barracks at the camp.\nHer memories of that time are not particularly traumatic, she says.\n\"Being a child at the time time, I had no worries and made lots of friends.\n\"We were able to go to school and learn Japanese,\" she adds.\nMs Katsura says she later learned that the camp authorities were keen for the children to learn Japanese so they would be able to speak the language once they were deported to Japan.\nChieko Kamisato's memories of life at Crystal City are less positive.\n\"You could call it a concentration camp, because we were surrounded by barbed wire fences and guards with guns,\" she says.\n\"We couldn't go out at all, although we were free to move around inside,\" she recalls.\n\"My parents were really bitter about the situation because they were forced to come to the US. They had no choice,\" she says.\nMs Kamisato's father had moved to Peru from Japan in 1915 and had worked hard to open a bakery in the capital, Lima.\nNow 81, she lives in Los Angeles.\nOf the 2,200 Latin Americans of Japanese descent to be interned in the US, 800 were sent to Japan as part of prisoner exchanges.\nAfter World War Two ended, another 1,000 were deported to Japan after their Latin American home countries refused to take them back.\nMs Katsura's and Ms Kamisato's families successfully fought deportation and were eventually allowed to remain in the US.\nIn 1988, then-President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act and apologised on behalf of the US government for the internment of Japanese-Americans.\nUnder the act, the government paid tens of thousands of survivors of the camps $20,000 (\u00c2\u00a313,000) each in reparation.\nBut Japanese-Latin Americans did not qualify for the payments because they had not been US citizens or permanent residents of the US at the time of their internment.\nOutraged, they filed a class-action suit and 10 years later, the US government agreed to pay them $5,000 each.\nMost accepted, but a small group headed by camp survivor Art Shibayama decided to hold out, demanding to be paid the same as Japanese-Americans.\nBlanca Katsura says that even though her childhood at the camp may not have been traumatic, no amount of money can compensate her family for its loss.\n\"My parents wanted to go back to Peru but couldn't.

It has to be met with disgust and much stronger resistance than has so far been the case.\"\nThe anti-immigration rhetoric has been toned down and carefully argued, with a policy of preferring to help refugees in their own countries.\nThere are obvious parallels with France's National Front which, under the leadership of Marine Le Pen, has moved into the political mainstream.\nThe two parties go back many years, and Ms Le Pen visited Jimmie Akesson last year in Stockholm. A few months ago he praised the National Front's \"modern, quite fresh direction\".\nThat does not mean the Sweden Democrats have shaken off their past but, with two MEPs in the European Parliament, they are now part of the same grouping as the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party - the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group.\nSwedish voters are attracted to the party, more because it gives a voice to people who dislike the political elite than its stance on immigration, Prof Bjereld believes.\nAnd although he argues that party membership will always have a racist element, the main stance is more xenophobic than racist.\n\"One of Jimmie Akesson's skills is that he sends one message to the racists in his party and another to the general public.\"",

    "10741274": "A UK and Finnish team found those with more education were as likely to show the signs of dementia in their brains at death as those with less.\nBut they were less likely to have displayed symptoms during their lifetime, the study in Brain said.\nExperts said scientists now had to find out why the effect occurred.\nOver the past decade, studies on dementia have consistently shown that the more time you spend in education, the lower the risk of dementia.\nBut studies have been unable to show whether or not education - which is linked to higher socio-economic status and healthier lifestyles - protects the brain against dementia.\nThe researchers in this study examined the brains of 872 people who had been part of three large ageing studies.\nBefore their deaths they had also completed questionnaires about their education.\nThe researchers found that more education makes people better able to cope with changes in the brain associated with dementia.\nPost-mortems showed the pathology - signs of disease - in the brains of people with and without long educations were at similar levels.\nBut the researchers found those with more education are better able to compensate for the effects of the condition.\nIt also showed that, for each year spent in education, there was an 11% decreased risk of developing dementia.\nDr Hannah Keage of the University of Cambridge, who co-authored the study, said: \"Previous research has shown that there is not a one-to-one relationship between being diagnosed with dementia during life and changes seen in the brain at death.\n\"One person may show lots of pathology in their brain while another shows very little, yet both may have had dementia.\n\"Our study shows education in early life appears to enable some people to cope with a lot of changes in their brain before showing dementia symptoms.\"\nThe researchers used data from the Eclipse collaboration, which combines the three European population-based longitudinal studies of ageing from the UK and Finland which have assessed people for up to 20 years.\nProfessor Carol Brayne, who led the study, said: \"Education is known to be good for population health and equity.\n\"This study provides strong support for investment in early life factors which should have an impact on society and the whole lifespan.\n\"This is hugely relevant to policy decisions about the importance of resource allocation between health and education.\"\nRuth Sutherland, chief executive  of the Alzheimer's Society, said: \"This is the largest study ever to confirm that hitting the books could help you fight the symptoms of dementia in later life. What we don't know is why a longer education is so good for you.\n\"It could be that the types of people who study longer have large brains which adapt better to changes associated with dementia.\n\"Another reason could be that educated people find ways of managing or hiding their symptoms.\"\nShe added: \"We now need more research to find out why an education can make the brain more 'dementia resistant'. Until then the message appears to be stay in school.\"\nRebecca Wood, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Research Trust, added: \"During dementia, proteins build up in the brain and nerve cells become damaged. This research suggests that education is not able to stop the damage but enables the brain to cope better and alleviate its impact. \"",

    "18639299": "Integration with the mainland has brought Hong Kong much success as a global financial centre but it has also created problems.\nThose problems seem to be at their worst at any time since the handover, according to a series of surveys and opinion polls.\nThe gap between Hong Kong's rich and poor is at a 30-year high, property rental prices have risen to record levels and residents are upset by daily news reports on corrupt lives of officials at the highest levels of Chinese government.\nAn independent poll shows the Hong Kong public's mistrust of the Chinese\u00a0government stands at a post handover high, largely because of a number of political scandals.\nThese include the sacking of senior Communist Party official Bo Xilai, the plight of human rights activist Chen Guangcheng and, most seriously, the suspicious death of Tiananmen Square dissident Li Wangyang in June.\n\"What happens in China very closely affects Hong Kong people, because we're all ethnic Chinese,\" said Frank Lee, a pollster at the University of Hong Kong's public opinion programme.\n\"That's probably the reason why, at this moment, many people don't trust the Beijing government. In fact, anger is at the peak right now.\"\nDespite a relatively strong economy and a string of financial incentives announced by Beijing to boost popular support in the semi-autonomous city, Hong Kong is a much more restive place than it was five years ago, when Mr Hu last came to visit, in a blaze of pre-Olympic glory.\nAhead of the visit, Hong Kong's census bureau publicised data that showed inequality had widened to its highest level in three decades.\nAccording to US government rankings, Hong Kong's wealth gap now outstrips all other developed nations. It ranks behind highly unequal countries such as Colombia, Haiti and Sierra Leone.\nMonthly incomes for Hong Kong's poorest have fallen by about 8% over the past five years, while salaries for the richest have grown by about 25%, according to the newest census data.\nSze Lai Shan, a social worker with the Society for Community Organisation, said as a result of integration with the mainland, Hong Kong's economic structure had changed.\n\"The factories have moved to mainland China, and the government believes in the trickle-down theory where everyone benefits from overall economic development. So they have done little for the poor,\" she said during a visit to a cramped sub-divided flat.\nThe first-floor flat is in the shadow of the glitzy commercial district of Causeway Bay.\nInside two dozen people - mostly single middle-age or elderly men - reside in enclosed wooden bunks the size of a single bed.\nLocals call these coffin homes, because each is slightly larger than the size of a coffin. Rent ranges from HK$1,000 ($128, \u00a383) to HK$1,400 per bunk.\nLee Chi Wai, a 57-year-old cleaner with a warm smile, lives with his worldly possessions - a tiny television, a few compact disks, some plastic shelves and several shirts - directly below Wong Ching Po, 60.\nWhen not working, the two men watch television and engage in friendly banter. Both decry the lack of opportunities and inadequate public housing in Hong Kong.\n\"It's very hard to find a job,\" said Mr Lee. \"Most companies have moved to China. Those that stay want temporary workers not permanent staff. When the contract is over, I have to look for another job. That is why life is hard.\"\nFollowing the release of the census figures, Hong Kong's incoming Chief Executive CY Leung - who is to be sworn in on Sunday - announced he would chair a new preparatory task force to tackle poverty.\nBesides anger over social inequality, Mr Hu will be greeted by two large-scale democracy protests over the weekend.\nThe rally on Sunday is the annual human rights demonstration that traditionally starts at Victoria Park and ends at the Hong Kong government office in Admiralty.\n\"Hong Kong people are very uptight about freedom issues on the mainland, because they reflect on us. If not today, then tomorrow. If it's not in Hong Kong's present, it's going to reflect on our future,\" said Claudia Mo, a member of the Civic Party.\nLast year more than 200,000 people took part. This year organisers hope the crowd will be even larger because Hong Kong residents feel the Chinese government is becoming more, not less, corrupt and repressive.\nThe other rally on Saturday, due to finish at the Hong Kong Exhibition Centre in Wanchai, is timed to coincide with Mr Hu's dinner plans.\nProtesters will demand a reversal of the official verdict on Tiananmen Square, currently branded a counter-revolutionary activity, and a thorough investigation into the death of Mr Li, the elderly, disabled Chinese activist.\nMr Li's suspicious death in early June in central China sparked outrage in Hong Kong. Chinese officials have promised a proper investigation, but Hong Kong people remain sceptical.\nAlthough Mr Hu's visit in 2007 coincided with pro-democracy protests, the political climate in China and Hong Kong was different at that time.\nFive years ago, China seemed relatively open to democratic reform, as it promised organisers who awarded Beijing the 2008 games.\nRestrictions were eased for foreign and Hong Kong journalists. Activists such as AIDS campaigner Hu Jia and pro-democracy campaigner Liu Xiaobo were given relative free rein to air their views.\nThe country appeared to be edging ever so slightly closer to Hong Kong's core democratic values of clean government, the rule of law and freedom of speech.\nBut this year the political atmosphere is strained as Mr Hu arrives bearing financial incentives to drum up public support. He is expected to stay until Sunday.",

    "35688387": "At an expat bar in Benalmadena, on the Costa del Sol, Brian was watching his club play a Champions League match on television. And the animation he displayed whenever his team got the ball was matched by his passion for the EU.\n\"I've got really good Spanish friends. Obviously, I feel English and British first, then I feel European,\" he says.\nWhat worries Brian is that Britain might now vote to leave the European Union.\n\"If I decided to up sticks, I could go to Portugal or France. But if Britain decides to leave\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 that may change.\"\nNo-one knows how many British people are, like Brian, long-term residents in Spain; the number is thought to be anywhere between 300,000 and 700,000.\nBut the British government has warned that two million British expats in Europe could be adversely affected in the event of an Out vote. Their right to free healthcare and their basic right to work could both be jeopardised, a Cabinet Office report says.\nCampaigners to leave the European Union have dismissed the report's findings as \"scaremongering\", part of what they see as a long-term strategy by the government which they have dubbed \"project fear\". It aims, they say, to persuade voters to stick with what they know and remain inside the EU.\nBut fears about leaving the EU are all too real, as far as Christine Rowlands is concerned. She's the chairwoman of the Costa del Sol branch of Conservatives Abroad, and insists that the party locally is united in wanting to remain inside the EU, unlike her political counterparts back home.\n\"It's not just about the money,\" she insists. \"Our friends are Danish, German, Spanish. It's about a united Europe.\"\nAsked what she makes of the Conservative debate on Europe back home in Britain, Christine giggles a little mischievously. \"It's like a children's playground,\" she says.\nThere is certainly a stark contrast here with the situation back home, where local Conservative Associations are perceived mainly to be of a Eurosceptic bent.\nBut in fact, there are plenty of Eurosceptic opinions to be heard on the Costa del Sol if you listen to the local English language radio station, Talk Radio Europe, and particularly its weekly phone-in show Viewpoint. It recently devoted a whole edition to the EU referendum, prompting many callers to sound off against the EU and all its works.\nDavid Cameron was denounced for fighting to keep Britain in, while Boris Johnson was praised for his \"courage\" in joining the Out camp. \"We did not vote for federalism, we voted for a common market,\" protested one listener.\nViewpoint's presenter is Richard Tildesley, a man with his ear very much glued to the ground when it comes to political opinion among expats. And he believes that living on the European mainland has put many people off the EU, however cosmopolitan their lives.\nThey are not impressed by how EU funds are spent, he believes, thinking the money is wasted on unnecessary projects while neglecting problems that badly need sorting out. Tildesley also argues that expats see the EU as destroying the very aspects of Spanish life that originally drew them to the country.\n\"What they perceive being created at the moment is a rather bland, pan-European homogenised culture.\"\nGiven the strength of opinion on this subject, it is perhaps surprising that so few expats in Spain have actually registered to vote, either in the forthcoming referendum, or indeed for any British elections.\nBritish citizens who leave the country are entitled to vote, providing they have been away for less than 15 years. But so far, only 11,000 people from the hundreds of thousands in Spain are on course to make use of this right.\nThe British embassy in Spain has launched a campaign to persuade British expats to register for the vote, a campaign that is being mirrored in countries across the world. It will use Facebook and Twitter to get its message across, but the embassy will also work with local Anglican churches, charities and any other organisations where expats are found.\n\"Registration of expat voters is fairly low across the world,\" British ambassador Simon Manley complains. Like any good diplomat, he gives no hint of his own view on the UK's membership of the EU, but he is passionate about the need for more voter engagement.\n\"The referendum is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to determine the future of our country.

    "33160852": "Mr Modi coaxed the United Nations into declaring 21 June International Yoga Day and announced a grand event to be held in Delhi on that day. His government plans to get tens of thousands of people to perform yoga in the heart of the capital on Sunday.\nMr Modi is an enthusiast himself - he told a biographer he tries to do yoga for an hour after waking up in the morning.\nSo what does Sunday's mass yoga session tell us about India?\nMr Modi's plan to get 35,000 people to perform yoga for 35 minutes on the stately Rajpath (King's Avenue) is aimed at setting a new Guinness World Record. The Guinness people have been invited to document the largest yoga class at a single venue.\nIndians already flaunt a number of yoga-related world records: the largest yoga class, longest yoga chain, longest yoga marathon and longest yoga class at multiple venues.\nInspired by Mr Modi's call, even India's National Cadet Corps want to set another record on Sunday - \"the largest ever demonstration of yoga by a uniformed organisation on a single day concurrently at multiple venues all across India\". It says a million cadets will simultaneously do yoga at 1,900 locations.\nYes, we are crazy about breaking world records.\nA reality check: Indians applied for some 3,000 records with Guinness World Records in 2013, just behind record-seekers from the US and Britain. The number of Indian record holders has risen an astonishing 250% in the past five years.\nIt helps that we are the world's second-most populous nation, so we have also set records in things like the biggest blood donation drive and most number of people shaking hands. Writer Samanth Subramanian describes this as a \"fevered subculture of record-setters\".\nIf a place in the Guinness World Records looks remote, no worries. We have our thriving, home-grown Limca Book of World Records and India Book of Records to take care of our achievements.\nBut Mr Modi, clearly, has set his sights higher.\nMore seriously, Sunday's gathering is a timely reminder that urban Indians need to get fitter.\nDoctors say India's cities are riding a diabetes and heart disease epidemic. India's diabetes rate jumped an alarming 123% between 1990 and 2013, compared to 45% worldwide, a new study found. One in four Indians die of heart disease. Obesity is on the rise.\nAs the middle class swells and grows richer, more Indians are leading desk-bound, sedentary work lives and enduring stressful commutes in pedestrian-unfriendly cities, where there is no culture of walking. Gorging on junk food and fat-rich diets doesn't help matters.\nIf Mr Modi's move encourages more Indians to take to yoga - with or without the spirituality attached to it - it would have served a purpose in making more Indians healthier.\nThe moment Mr Modi's government unveiled its mega yoga plans, political rivals cried foul.\nMayawati, the feisty leader of India's Dalits (formerly known as untouchables) said Mr Modi's party and its hardline allies were trying to use yoga to \"vitiate communal harmony\".\nThe main opposition Congress party has taken pot-shots at the event, and a senior party spokesperson issued a snarky broadside:\nSome Muslim clerics are uneasy about the government's motives and equate Mr Modi's government's promotion of yoga with promoting Hinduism. A recent story by Reuters was headlined: PM Modi's yoga offensive gets Muslims stressed.\nFirebrand ruling BJP MP Yogi Adityanath fanned the flames by saying that those who opposed the surya namaskar - a series of yoga positions designed to greet Surya, the Hindu Sun God - \"should drown in the sea\" - a remark that was swiftly put down by Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj.\nThe government has even taken out the sun salutation exercise from Sunday's performance, and is very keen to  showcase it as secular.\nPolitical analyst Neerja Chowdhury says Sunday's event serves the prime minister well. \"It's a win-win situation for Mr Modi. It boosts his image and keeps the hardliners happy,\" she told me.\nHowever, critics say Mr Modi's move comes at a time of rising anxiety among India's minorities, many of whom suspect that his party is trying to make India a pronouncedly Hindu nation.\nAnalyst Ajaz Ashraf says Mr Modi's yoga celebration is a \"mix of cultural nationalism, commercialisation and subtle coercion\". Historian Dilip Simeon decries what he calls the \"deceitful polemic about yoga\" and says Indians will learn yoga not to please Hindu nationalists, \"but for our health\".\n\"Yoga is part of ancient India's cultural heritage,\" says Manmohan Vaidya, a spokesperson of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the hardline ideological godfather of the BJP and the largest Hindu nationalist group in India. \"By celebrating yoga on a mass scale we are validating our glorious past.\"\nOthers say yoga is India's biggest contribution to society after, perhaps, zero and is a symbol of its cultural richness.\nThere are concerns that India has lost control of \"brand yoga\" to the West - yoga is a multi-billion dollar industry worldwide - although Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj has said India would \"never like an Intellectual Property Rights stamp on yoga\".\nIs yoga essentially a religious activity? This BBC magazine piece has some answers. But closer to home, the Yoga Day is being seen by many as (Hindu) India \"reclaiming\" yoga.\nWendy Doniger, leading American academic and author of The Hindus: An Alternative History, says many Hindus, concerned about their image, fear that their religion has been stereotyped in the West as a polytheistic faith of \"castes, cows and curry\". They look at yoga as the poster-child of Indian spiritual wisdom and the essence of Hinduism.\nBut this, Doniger believes, ignores yoga's complex and contested history: there are at least five conflicting claims about when yoga began, including a provocative assertion by Mark Singleton that the roots of modern yoga actually do not lie in ancient India.\nThe transnational, Anglophone yoga, Singleton argues, derives from a curious mix of British body-building and physical culture, American transcendentalism, Christian science, naturopathy, Swedish gymnastics and the YMCA. Yoga's appeal grew far and wide. Even Fritz Lang made a film about trippy yogis.\nIn the end, as Doniger says, \"for some people yoga is a religious meditation, for others an exercise routine, and for others, both\".\n\"It is a rich, multi-cultural, interdisciplinary construction, far from the pure line that its adherents often claim for it.\"\nThere's no shortage of humour in India - and Sunday's event is no exception.\nI think sociologist Shiv Visvanathan puts it best. \"[Mr Modi] is looking for a new kind of cultural revolution. I like the comic part of it - the fat cops, the bureaucrats, doing exercise. Here is India, getting fat on hamburgers and milkshakes. Modi is the Benjamin Franklin of India in many ways,\" he told the New York Times.\nEven India's Home Minister Rajnath Singh has managed to encourage officials in his office to practice yoga after work, as he keeps a watchful eye on their moves:\nShripad Naik, the yoga minister, told the New York Times that yoga practice would help lower violent crime and produce better bureaucrats.\n\"There will be a definite change in the way the bureaucracy functions,\" he said. \"When they are thin, all their energy will go into producing better work.\"\nAnd popular yoga guru Baba Ramdev told a yoga rehearsal at a Delhi stadium last week that a yoga position would help \"rid the world of gas\".\nBut this man practising on the soggy rain-soaked field did not quite appear to be listening to the guru's exhortations to put on the world's best yoga show on Sunday.",

    "24085062": "The IPCC - weren't they the ones who said the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035? How can we trust what they say this time?\nThe weight given to the reports of the IPCC is a measure of the global scale of scientific involvement with the panel.\nDivided into three working groups that look at the physical science, the impacts and options to limit climate change, the panel involves thousands of scientists around the world.\nThe first report, to be presented in Stockholm, has 209 lead authors and 50 review editors from 39 countries.\nThe 30-page Summary for Policymakers that will be published after review by government officials in the Swedish capital is based on around 9,000 peer-reviewed scientific papers and 50,000 comments from the expert reviewers.\nBut among these icebergs of data, things can and do go awry.\nIn the last report, published in 2007, there were a handful of well publicised errors, including the claim that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035. The wrong percentage was also given for the amount of land in the Netherlands under sea level.\nThe IPCC admitted it had got it wrong and explained that, in a report running to 3,000 pages, there were bound to be some mistakes. The Himalayan claim came from the inclusion of an interview that had been published in the magazine New Scientist.\nIn its own words, the IPCC is there \"to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts\".\nThe offspring of two UN bodies, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, it has issued four heavyweight assessment reports to date on the state of the climate.\nThese are commissioned by the governments of 195 countries, essentially the entire world. These reports are critical in informing the climate policies adopted by these governments.\nThe IPCC itself is a small organisation, run from Geneva with a full time staff of 12. All the scientists who are involved with it do so on a voluntary basis.\nIn 2009, a review of the way the IPCC assesses information suggested the panel should be very clear in future about the sources of the information it uses.\nThe panel was also scarred by association with the \"Climategate\" rumpus. Leaked emails between scientists working for the IPCC were stolen and published in 2009.\nThey purported to show some collusion between researchers to make climate data fit the theory of human-induced global warming more clearly. However at least three investigations found no evidence to support this conclusion.\nBut the overall effect of these events on the panel has been to make them more cautious.\nAlthough this new report is likely to stress a greater certainty among scientists that human activities are causing climate warming, in terms of the scale, level and impacts, the word \"uncertainty\" features heavily.\n\"What we are seeing now is that this working group is getting more careful than they already were,\" said Prof Arthur Petersen, chief scientist at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.\n\"Overall, the message is, in that sense, more conservative I expect, for this IPCC report compared to previous ones.\"\nHasn't global warming stopped since 1998?\nThe 2007 IPCC report made no mention of any slowdown or standstill in temperature rises in recent decades. They pointed out that the linear warming trend over the previous 50 years was 0.13C per decade, which was twice that for the past 100 years.\nThey forecast that, if emissions of carbon dioxide continued on their existing path, over the next century the climate would respond by warming between 2C and 4.5C, with a most likely rise of 3C.\nBut since 2007, climate sceptics have loudly argued that global average temperatures haven't actually gone above the level recorded in 1998.\nThe issue is now being taken more seriously by the IPCC and other respected science organisations.\nMy colleague David Shukman summarised some of the explanations now being offered as to why the temperatures have not risen more quickly in line with the modelling.\nMost scientists believe that the warming has continued over the past 15 years, but more of the heat has gone into the oceans. They are unsure about the mechanisms driving this change in behaviour.\nThe most recent peer reviewed article suggested that a periodic, natural cooling of the Pacific Ocean was counteracting the impact of carbon dioxide.\n\"1998 was a particular hot year due to a record-breaking El Ni\u00f1o event, while recently we have had mostly the opposite - cool conditions in the tropical Pacific,\" Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, told BBC News.\n\"That warming has not stopped can be seen from the ongoing heat accumulation in the global oceans.\"\nClimate sceptics, however, argue that the pause is evidence that climate models used by the IPCC are too sensitive and exaggerate the effects of carbon dioxide.\n\"In the last year, we have seen several studies showing that climate sensitivity is actually much less than we thought for the last 30 years,\" said Marcel Crok, a Dutch author who is sceptical of the IPCC process.\n\"These studies show that our real climate has a sensitivity of between 1.5C and 2.0C. But the models are much more sensitive, and warm up three degrees.\"\nAm I going to get flooded?\nThe 2007 IPCC report was heavily criticised for its estimations on sea level rise.\nThe panel suggested that a warming planet would see waters around the world rise by between 18cm and 59cm by the end of this century. Heat causes the seas to expand but also increases the rate of melting of glaciers and ice sheets.\nThe IPCC doesn't commission any new science, but reviews and condenses existing peer reviewed material.\nEach Summary for Policymakers is a short distillation of an underlying report that can stretch to several hundred pages. The final draft of the short summary is presented to representatives of the 195 governments who commission the report.\nIn a hectic week before publication, every single line is gone through by the scientists and civil servants. The lead authors are in the room and can veto a change if it isn't supported in the underlying report.\nThe IPCC figure didn't include any estimates for the extra water coming from the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets as they said they didn't have enough accurate information.\nOther researchers were critical of this approach and have published studies that suggested a far higher sea level rise.\nBut in recent months, a study funded by the European Union and involving scientists across the world, came up with what they believe is the most accurate estimate yet - and it increases the level of sea rise by just 10cm from the IPCC report.\n\"What we are talking about is a reduction in uncertainty - we find we haven't changed the number enormously compared to AR4 (IPCC 2007 report),\" said Prof David Vaughan, from the British Antarctic Survey (Bas), while speaking at the launch of the report.\n\"We've added maybe another 10cm but the level of certainty we have around that is actually higher than it was in the AR4.\"\nLeaked details from the forthcoming report indicate that the worst sea level rise scenarios for the year 2100, under the highest emissions of carbon dioxide, could reach 97cm.\nSome scientists, including Prof Rahmstorf, have been unhappy with the models used by the IPCC to calculate the rise. Using what's termed a semi-empirical model, the projections for sea level can reach 2m. At that point, an extra 187 million people across the world would be flooded.\nBut the IPCC is likely to say that there is no consensus about the semi-empirical approach and will stick with the lower figure of just under 1m.\nSo will all this mean more flooding?\n\"Yes, but not everywhere,\" said Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds. \"Generally, the wet regions will get wetter and the dry ones drier.\"\nThe report is also likely to assess the intensity of storms, and there might be some better news in that there is likely to be a downwards revision.\nAnd what about the Polar bears?\nThe state of the North and South Poles has been of growing concern to science as the effects of global warming are said to be more intense in these regions.\nThe IPCC has evolved a complicated way of communicating scientific certainty and confidence in a finding:\nvery unlikely - 0-10%\nunlikely - 10-33%\nlikely as not - 33-66%\nlikely - 66-100%\nvery likely - 90-100%\nExtremely likely - 95-100%\nVirtually certain - 99-100%\nConfidence is also expressed as very low, low, medium, high and very high.\nEvidence can can be limited, medium or robust.\nAnd levels of agreement can be low, medium or high\nIn 2007, the IPCC said that temperatures in the Arctic increased at almost twice the global average rate in the past 100 years. They pointed out that the region can be highly variable, with a warm period observed between 1925 and 1945.\nIn the drafts of the latest report, the scientists say there is stronger evidence that ice sheets and glaciers are losing mass and sea ice cover is decreasing in the Arctic.\nIn relation to Greenland, which by itself has the capacity to raise global sea levels by six metres, the panel says they are 90% certain that the average rate of ice loss between 1992 and 2001 has increased six-fold in the period 2002 to 2011.\nWhile the Arctic mean sea ice extent has declined by around 4% per decade since 1979, the Antarctic has increased up to 1.8% per decade over the same time period.\nAs for the future, the suggestions are quite dramatic. Under the worst carbon emissions scenarios, an Arctic free of sea ice in the summer by the middle of this century is likely.\nSome recent newspaper reports have suggested that sea ice in the Arctic has recovered in 2013, but scientists are virtually certain about the trend.\n\"The sea ice cover on the Arctic ocean is in a downward spiral,\" said Prof Rahmstorf. \"And much faster than IPCC predicted.\"\nAnd Prof Shang-Ping Xie from the University of California in San Diego told BBC News that the outlook for polar bears and other species isn't good.\n\"There will be pockets of sea ice in some marginal seas. Hopefully, polar bears will be able to survive summer on these pockets of remaining sea ice,\" he said.\nDoes the IPCC have a future?\nThere have been growing calls for reform of the IPCC process from critics and friends alike.\nMany believe that these big, blockbuster reports, published once every six years, are not the way forward in the modern era.\n\"The close government scrutiny and infrequent publication certainly fillip the climate change agenda,\" said Prof Forster.\n\"But, given the pace of both science and news, perhaps it is time the IPCC moved with the Twitter generation.\"\nMany sceptical voices are also calling for changes.\nMarcel Crok says the whole process of the IPCC is bad for the scientific principle of open argument.\n\"It is not designed to answer questions because the whole IPCC process, the whole consensus-building process, is choking the openness of the scientific debate,\" he explained.\nHowever, some argue the IPCC plays an important role as a source of information for developing countries.\nAnd again others think the organisation will survive for far more unprincipled reasons. \"It is a UN body,\" said Prof Petersen. \"It may perpetuate until eternity.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter.",

Many here view the use of the Ukrainian language as central to the country's identity.\nThey believe that - after centuries of Russian and Soviet hegemony - to be a true Ukrainian, one must speak Ukrainian.\nAnything less is to surrender to the country's one-time cultural and political masters in Moscow - where many still view Ukraine as a Russian appendage - and ultimately threatens the country's continued independence.\n\"This law is sending an incredibly powerful signal that the Ukrainian language is not needed,\" said Roman Tsupryk, a political commentator and chairman of the editorial board of the Ukrainian weekly \"Tyzhden\" (Week).\n\"People don't see the mechanism behind it, but they will see the consequences in a year or a year and half.\"\nPeople in the country's Russian-speaking east and south have a predictably different view on the matter.\nThey say that they are patriotic Ukrainians - just ones that speak another language - and they simply wish to have the right to speak their native tongue in courts, government offices and schools, as the new legislation stipulates.\nThey also bristle at the accusation - especially in the country's west, where Ukrainian is predominantly spoken - that they are any less Ukrainian than the rest of the country.\n\"I speak Russian - what's the big problem?\" said Ruslan, a taxi driver in the eastern city of Donetsk, who asked to use only his first name.\n\"Why do people in the west get to say who is Ukrainian and who isn't?\"\nGiven the intense emotions on either side of the language debate, however, the question arises why President Viktor Yanukovych's ruling Party of Regions chose this moment to stir up this particular hornet's nest?\nSome analysts believe the new language law is an opening salvo in the government's campaign for parliamentary elections in October.\nThe law, touching on a cultural hot button, they say, serves a dual purpose - it distracts the electorate from more pressing issues like Ukraine's continued economic slump, and it riles up the political \"base.\"\n\"Every time we have elections, the issue of language is there,\" said Oleh Rybachuk, a cabinet member in the previous government and now an independent analyst.\n\"Language is not so important - it is not among the top 15 priorities of the people. But for some reason, every time we have elections, we have that issue.\"\nAccording to Mr Rybachuk, however, opposition politicians also welcome this issue, since it allows them to mobilise their own constituency.

It was a pledge in the party's 2010 election.\nHowever, the Lib Dems blocked any changes as part of their coalition agreement and inheritance tax thresholds have remained frozen since 2009.\nUnder current rules, no tax is paid on the first \u00a3325,000 of an estate's value. The allowance can also be transferred between married couples making it worth \u00a3650,000.\nAccording to the Guardian, the Conservatives are considering plans for a new tax-free band worth \u00a3175,000 per person applying specifically to family homes or main residences passed on to a direct descendant of the deceased.\nThis, it claimed, would be transferrable between married couples making it worth a maximum of \u00a3350,000.\nIt could then be added to the existing inheritance tax threshold, meaning that in some circumstances properties worth up to \u00a31m could escape inheritance tax altogether.\nThe plans, which would not be as generous as the Conservatives' 2010 inheritance tax policy, would reportedly cost about \u00a31bn.\nAs part of the plans, allowances for estates worth more than \u00a32m would be progressively withdrawn in relation to their value.\nThis \"taper\" scheme could result in about 2,000 estates paying up to \u00a3260,000 more inheritance tax by 2016-17, assuming the plans were introduced in 2016.\nThe paper, written by Treasury officials for the Conservative minister David Gauke, notes the scheme would be \"very popular with the public and in the media\" and would primarily benefit \"high income and wealthier households\".\n\"It will allow you to say you are exempting those with modest homes from inheritance tax, with up to \u00a31m of assets exempted in certain circumstances,\" it states.\n\"This reflects the concern raised by the public about rising house prices increasingly leading to estates with a modest house particularly in London and the south east paying inheritance tax.\"\nWhen he was shadow chancellor, George Osborne said the Conservatives would raise the Inheritance Tax threshold to \u00a31m, the announcement coming in the autumn of 2007 amid speculation that the then prime minister Gordon Brown would call a snap election.\nBut the idea has not been seriously discussed since 2010.\nAsked whether it was now being revived, Conservative business minister Matthew Hancock said \"he did not know about that\", merely saying that the idea had been \"floated seven or eight years ago\".\n\"That was in in our last manifesto just over five years ago,\" he told the BBC.\nMr Cable said many people in his west London constituency were concerned about inheritance tax and he understood the \"human instinct\" to pass on property to children.\nBut he said the plan sent a \"very bad signal about the chancellor's priorities\", which he said should be focused on reducing the tax burden on the lowest-paid.\n\"This is an old chestnut that is wheeled out before every election,\" he told the BBC.\nEarlier this year, David Cameron said he would like to \"go further\" and take more families out of inheritance tax but warned about the cost of such a move.\nBut speaking on Tuesday, Mr Cameron said inheritance tax was \"not something in the Budget\" and dismissed suggestions the Lib Dems were standing in the way of his plans.\nUKIP leader Nigel Farage told the BBC's Daily Politics he would abolish inheritance tax altogether, suggesting this \"common sense, straight forward\" move was the only way of helping people under-40 get on the property ladder in London.\nThe Treasury collected \u00a33.4bn in inheritance tax in 2013-4, an 8.6% increase on the year before.

    "37092824": "Wenger has big problems at the back and I really fear for his side if he does not bring Laurent Koscielny back into central defence on Saturday.\nThe way young duo Calum Chambers and Rob Holding performed there in last week's defeat by Liverpool means there is a massive question mark over them, and Wenger's decision to play them.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSome Gunners supporters are already unhappy and, if this game also goes the wrong way, they are going to become even more irate.\nThat is really unhelpful for their players at this stage of the season when they are trying to gain momentum and confidence, so Wenger has a big call to make - and he has to get it right.\nArsenal were the only team to beat Leicester home and away last season but I cannot see them dominating the Foxes this time.\nIt will be end to end because the Gunners are not capable of shutting up shop. They will have a go at Claudio Ranieri's side, which of course plays into their hands.\nOn their day, Arsenal's free-flowing football is good enough to destroy anyone and it does not matter who they play at the back.\nHowever, they looked fragile with Chambers and Holding playing together and there was definitely a lack of confidence in their defence, which is why Koscielny has to return this time. I would be amazed if he doesn't.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nKoscielny is not injured, just being rested after returning to training late after Euro 2016 and, even if he is only 80% fit, I would play him.\nIn his position, he does not have to cover as much ground as other outfield players and he could get through the game.\nAs a player, if I was in his situation I would be hammering on the manager's door saying, 'you need me, I can play, stick me in'.\nBut maybe he is saying that, and Wenger is still not picking him because he thinks he is not ready physically. If that is the case Wenger will have to take responsibility if things go wrong again.\nArsenal played a high-pressing game in the first half against Liverpool but they could not sustain that tempo for 90 minutes - it is virtually impossible for any team.\nWhen the Gunners stopped doing it, in the second half at Emirates Stadium, they conceded a flurry of goals but very rarely will they come up against a team that plays so well for such an intense period of a game.\nYes, Arsenal could have defended better, kept their shape better and played more percentage football but Liverpool's performance in that 20-minute spell was pretty sensational and they scored some absolutely brilliant goals.\nSo I don't think Wenger will be overly concerned that will happen to his team every week, and he certainly will not be worried about it against Leicester. I don't think Arsenal will try to press the Foxes in the same way.\nI would imagine he and the Arsenal players believe they can go to the King Power Stadium, dominate the ball and cause more problems than the Foxes can cause them.\nThey did it last season, when they won 5-2, and they will think that once again they have more quality on the pitch so they will create more chances and be able to win the game playing that way too.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nLeicester also lost last week, going down to a surprise defeat at Hull.\nBut I did not read too much into the Foxes' poor performance because their defence was missing Robert Huth, whose organisation and presence was absolutely pivotal in their title win.\nHuth is back from his ban on Saturday and he might not be the only familiar face back in Ranieri's starting XI.\nAgainst Hull, he left out Marc Albrighton and Shinji Okazaki from the team that played almost every game last season.\nI understand why he did it - because he is trying to move his team forward - but it is hard to do that while retaining the same ethos that brought them their success.\nThey will be desperate for three points from their first home game of the season, and a tried and tested line-up might be the way to get it. They are likely to return to their regular way of playing too.\nLeicester only had more possession than their opponents in five of their 38 league games last season, but they had marginally more of the ball than Hull last weekend - 50.3%.\nThe Tigers sat deep and did not allow them to play to their strengths on the break but against Arsenal the game is far more likely to follow a pattern that suits Ranieri's fast attackers.\nI also think Leicester have to be careful not to believe their own hype now they are champions, start to over-play and forget their strengths.\nIt can easily happen - I played in teams where we did that when we just won a few games in a row, for example at Fulham when we were on a good run and got a bit confident.\nWe still had Bobby Zamora up top, who we could play long to, get the ball into his chest and play off him but at times he would be screaming at us to give him the ball because we would be passing it around at the back thinking we were a good side.\nAll of a sudden teams were pressing us, nicking the ball and causing us problems, and we had to rethink, and remember what was getting us results.\nLeicester have bright players and a clever manager so I do not see that being a massive issue for them, especially on Saturday. Arsenal will come at them and leave space behind their defence for them to pump it up there for Jamie Vardy to get in the channels and cause havoc.\nThis is a big game for Vardy, against the team he turned down over the summer.\nHe was visibly frustrated at missing the chances he got against Hull and, facing Arsenal, he will be determined to prove a point and show them why they wanted him.\nThere is the chance the circumstances mean he could try a little bit too hard to make things happen instead of just playing naturally but it will be hard to tell because he looks like he gives absolutely everything in every game anyway.\nI actually thought he was a bit unlucky not to score against Hull because he was only denied by a tremendous block.\nYes, he also blazed one shot over the bar which is unlike him but he set himself ridiculously high standards last season and it will be very difficult for him to maintain that ratio.\nIt is the same for any striker, and can happen for a variety of reasons but I do not see it becoming an issue for Vardy because the way he plays and the way his team plays means he is always going to get chances, including against Arsenal.\nThe occasion is set up for him and, the way he is, it certainly would not surprise me if he goes and bangs in the winner.\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

They echoed the aspirations and struggles of the blue-collar worker.\nIn the words of critic Bob Allen, Haggard, above all, succeeded in \"capturing in metaphor the bleary-eyed angst and dark revelations of the soul that lie beyond the second six-pack\".\nIn the 1970s, he was the scourge of liberal America with songs like Okie from Muskogee, which poked fun at hippies and the anti Vietnam war movement, and the deeply patriotic Fightin' Side of Me, a love-America-or leave-it anthem.\nHaggard's early life is the stuff of legend. His family migrated from the dust-bowl of Oklahoma to Bakersfield, California where Merle was born in 1937.\nHis father died when Merle was nine, and his devout Christian mother was unable to control him. The young Merle became a teenage tearaway, hopping freight trains, working in orchards and oil fields, and getting mixed up in petty crime.\nHe was sent to, and escaped from, a variety of penal institutions. He wound up serving nearly three years in San Quentin for burglary and escape.\nHe was subsequently pardoned by the then governor of California, Ronald Reagan, whom he later befriended.\nHaggard married a waitress, Leona Hobbs, at 17, with whom he had four children over a 10-year period. He was behind bars when the first two were born.\nA love of singing and a concert by Johnny Cash, in 1958, inspired him to join the prison band. Songs from his experience inside include Sing Me Back Home, Branded Man and Mama Tried.\nHis first number one hit came with I'm a Lonesome Fugitive in 1966. He achieved great popularity with an album of love songs recorded with his second wife, Bonnie Owens.\nIn the late 1960s, Haggard enjoyed success with several country classics, including I Take a Lot of Pride in What I Am, and Silver Wings. His song Today I Started Loving You Again has been recorded by more than 400 singers.\nThe bleakness of recession-hit America was perfectly expressed in If We Make It Through December which provided Haggard with his only significant pop hit.\nBetween 1973 and 1976, he achieved nine straight number one country singles. His struggle with alcohol inspired Swinging Doors and The Bottle Let Me Down. It also led to divorce, his second of three.\nHaggard's voice, wide-ranging both dynamically and emotionally, lent itself well to interpreting other people's material too.\nHe recorded tributes to such giants as Jimmie Rodgers, Bob Wills and Elvis Presley. He was a fine guitarist and even played the fiddle well.\nBy 1990, Merle Haggard had notched up 95 country hits including 38 number ones.

But the next day when we speak to those preparing to make the journey, the government will have its people listening in.\nWe get up before the sun hits the grassland.\nThere are villages nearby and these days - during the freezing winter months at least - most people here live in fixed dwellings.\nFollowing a deliberate government policy of relocation, Tibetans have moved into the towns. Critics say this has been a control mechanism which allows the authorities to be able to track people more easily. The Communist Party says it was done to improve people's living standards, nothing more.\nSo, for much of the year, people have televisions, fridges and electrical lights. But when the summer comes they head for the hills - back to the land of their forebears.\n\"Nomads here are nomads to the bottom of our hearts,\" Kalsang Gyatso tells us. \"We lived like this from ancient times. Actually we don't like being in houses.\"\nWe meet him and other family members rounding up their yaks and pushing them into a pen. Soon they, like all their neighbouring herdsmen, will follow the same route as every year and drive their livestock into the mountains where the grass hasn't been touched for months.\n\"If we don't go to the summer grasslands and just stay in the winter fields there will be no food left for the yaks. When they have new grass to eat, our animals will grow fat and they'll produce enough milk.\"\nHe also tells us that the summer pastures have medicinal flowers which the yaks need to eat in order to stay healthy.\nThe government official who had been standing in the field and listening to our interview suddenly disappears. Perhaps he realised that our story really is about what we said it was about and that it's not hurting anyone to speak about these matters.\nNext to Kalsang Gyatso's place runs a recently laid tar road and along it the sound of hundreds of hooves can be heard. The migration is on!\nCars and trucks must part a sea of animals in order to get through. Most drivers just stop and wait for the beasts to pass.\nThe Tibetans are on horseback, calling and whistling to keep their livestock moving. Some of the yaks carry the bedding they'll need upon arrival as well as other bits and pieces for camping.\nOne young man speaks to us as he rides past. He says they must move now in order to make the most of new grass and provide for their families and that the dates for the journey are actually fixed by government regulations.\nI ask how he feels getting back to the old ways at least for a few months, expecting a description of the rich ancient culture again flowing through his veins. \"I'm a little bit tired,\" he says.\nAs we follow group after group heading further to the west we reach\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 a grassland adventure park.\nIt is being built smack in the middle of the main migration route and has already been opened. Eventually this attraction will be able to handle thousands of tourists on any given day.\nWe watch as yaks in their hundreds are pushed through the car park, under the main gate, past the turnstiles and soon they are surrounding the tourist buses carrying ethnic Han Chinese travellers in search of an awe-inspiring Tibetan experience.\nChina's Tibetan areas have been hotbeds of rebellion in the past, with some blaming Beijing for restrictions on Tibetan Buddhism, language and culture.\nThe government's answer: development.\nWe board one of the buses and speak to those taking photos of the Tibetans riding along outside.\n\"Up here it's exactly the eating a mouthful of meat, drinking a mouthful of wine plateau feeling that I wanted,\" says one woman.\n\"It feels like another world. I feel stronger about Tibetan culture because Tibetans are purer and lead a more simple life,\" says another and her friend nods.\nThey seem to have genuine affection for the people who call this place home and inside the adventure park they will come into contact with the Tibetans who have been employed here.\nThe herding communities, however, are divided about whether the explosion in tourist numbers is such a good thing.\nEven the Tibetans who have opened small guest lodges with areas for camping are worried that their once pristine environment is gradually being overrun.\nTshe Bdag Skyabs has been travelling with his animals for two days.\n\"On the one hand, people's incomes have increased and transportation is more convenient,\" he says. \"But the environmental harm from development has been huge.\"\nEventually he, his family and 400 yaks pass the tourist park and the outer limit of modern existence.\nThey arrive at the untainted expanse of the high mountain grasslands.\nHere there are no shops, no roads, no tourists, but there is the space of their ancestors.\n\"When I make it here my mood is very good, exceptionally good,\" he tells us. \"When city people come here they will also feel happy because of the fresh air and the smell of wildflowers. It's like a fairyland.\"\nThey will stay here until September. They will walk with bare feet in order to preserve the flowers that their yaks need to eat. They will milk their animals to make butter tea and cheese. And when the weather starts getting cold, they'll head back down the mountain, to return again next year.\nWhen a traditional way of life collides with a massive influx of tourism it's always going to be good and bad.\nYou can only hope that the benefits outweigh any pitfalls.\nBut, when it comes to the grassland Tibetans - if what we have seen is anything to go by - despite everything that the modern world is throwing at them, their culture does appear to remain remarkably resilient.\nAt least, for these communities. At least, for the time being.",

    "34173549": "That is one of the findings from an opinion poll commissioned by the BBC from ORB International that examines public opinion in both Iraq and Syria.\nSome 66% of those questioned in Iraq and 57% in Syria think their country is heading in the wrong direction. Perhaps more shocking is that one quarter of those questioned in Iraq and more than one third in Syria think their country is actually on the right track.\n66%\nthink the country is going in the wrong direction\n90%\nbelieve a diplomatic solution to national differences can be found\n84% think Islamic State are a \"strongly negative\" influence\n56% Oppose coalition air strikes\nBut what is fascinating is that it was possible to conduct this opinion poll at all - especially given the continuing violence in Iraq and the chaos in war-torn Syria.\nJohnny Heald of ORB International said his company has been polling in Iraq every year since 2005, though he admits that the security situation is challenging in some governorates.\nThe Iraq poll is not nationally representative, he notes, since it was restricted to 10 of the 18 governorates, with no interviews conducted in the three Kurdish governorates or in some of the smaller Shia governorates.\nHe argues though that what gives his Syria poll credibility is the geographic distribution of those interviewed.\n\"In all polling the data is only as good as the sample upon which it is drawn,\" he told me. \"This data from Syria covers opinion throughout all 14 governorates across the country.\n\"So it includes those people living under the control of the regime, under the control of the so-called Islamic State [IS], [al-Qaeda affiliate] al-Nusrah, the wider opposition and the YPG [Kurdish fighters].\"\nMore than 14 supervisors and 40 interviewers travelled throughout the country to collect data.\n\"It starts with one week's training in southern Turkey where the supervisors come to Gaziantep and we go through the methodology, the questionnaire and the quality control procedures,\" Mr Heald said.\n\"We pilot the questionnaire before it is fielded. We then ensure we have the relative permits/permissions to operate and undertake a risk assessment.\"\nBut how do you set about conducting field research in an IS-controlled area?\n\"In the IS-controlled areas of Raqqa for each survey we visit the head of the town and ask him for permission to randomly interview people,\" Mr Heald says.\n\"His response is 'so long as you are not an international media station and pull out video cameras, I don't mind you doing this'.\"\n\"Why is this his reaction? Because, as the data verifies, many of those living in Raqqa now are happier since IS took over.\n\"They welcome the security, they see IS trying to help the people with electricity, with food, with petrol. In many respects it is a story they are keen to tell.\"\n57%\nthink the country is going in the wrong direction\n50%\noppose coalition air strikes\n48% said Islamic State are a \"strongly negative\" influence\n21% prefer life now compared to before the war\nThis perhaps surprising finding is one of the values of this kind of survey.\nAs Mr Heald said, the survey suggests that \"the majority in both countries are opposed to IS but that they also think that IS is a product of foreign countries\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 which to you and I may seem like some crazy conspiracy theory but to them it is a common perception.\n\"Widespread opposition to the coalition bombing, should also make policymakers reconsider their strategy. I think the official British government line is that coalition air strikes are 'degrading' IS.\n\"But while we can accept that it may be slowing them down,\" he says, \"there is little evidence to suggest they are losing the war. People aren't leaving Raqqa now because of IS - they are leaving because of the coalition air strikes.\"\nFor Western policymakers there is a lot to be gloomy about here.\nMore than one quarter of those questioned in Syria still see President Bashar al-Assad as exercising a strongly positive influence over the country. But the ORB survey does find some guarded grounds for optimism.\n\"Majorities in both Iraq and Syria, oppose the break up of their country,\" Mr Heald said. \"Majorities think that despite doctrinal differences they are stronger together than fighting each other. Self-identifying as an Iraqi or a Syrian is a preferred option to identifying as a Sunni or a Shia.\"\nBut what of the broader value of such opinion surveys? Mr Heald is a pollster so he is clearly not going to undermine his own business.\nBut he surely makes a valid point when he says: \"Policymakers need to understand public opinion in these countries. IS have an incredibly well-oiled strategic communication operation. Politicians and military leaders need to track public opinion to see where hearts and minds are and how they are shifting.\n\"There are also significant operations taking place in country - whether they be aid-related, messaging-related or kinetic (air strikes). Only by tracking public opinion can they measure the performance and effect of these activities and thereby determine which, if any, are successful in changing behaviour.\"",

The IFS \"also exposes how families with children have been hit hardest\", he added.\n\"Their damning conclusion is that low-income households with children lose the most as a percentage of their income from changes implemented by the coalition.\n\"While millions are paying more, we know that millionaires are paying less.\"\nHe repeated Labour's claim that a Conservative government would increase VAT to make their sums add up - something denied last month by David Cameron.\nThe Conservatives claim Labour would be forced to increase National Insurance contributions to pay for their spending plans.\nBy Carole Walker, BBC Conservative Campaign Correspondent\nDavid Cameron and George Osborne will both be out campaigning in the South West on the day tax changes affecting millions of voters take effect.\nMr Cameron will be meeting some carefully selected voters who will benefit from the changes. The opposing parties are already hurling conflicting statistics over how many of us have gained or lost under the outgoing government.\nThe apparent contradictions reflect the fact that the opposing parties are choosing different figures. So Mr Cameron will point out that more than 90% of working households will be better off under the changes which come in today, largely due to the rise in the amount we can earn before we pay tax.\nLabour has countered that families are on average \u00a31,100 a year worse off because of the tax and welfare changes since 2010; much of this is due to benefit cuts.\nDavid Cameron will say there is not just an economic case but a moral case for low taxes, saying this goes to the heart of what he believes in as a Conservative.\nBut in an apparent acknowledgement that many people do not yet feel they are benefitting from the upturn in the economy, he will say: \"I don't just want people to see Britain's recovery on the TV or hear it on the radio, I want them to feel it in their lives.\"\nHe'll claim that today's changes will help that to happen.\nFew of us want to hand over more of our earnings in taxes, but as we saw in last week's television debate, some of his political rivals are mounting strong arguments that taxes should be raised for higher earners.\nThere is another flipside to the commitment to low taxes.  The Tories need to save \u00a330bn to eliminate the deficit by 2017/18 and if they won't put up taxes, all the money will have to come from spending cuts.\nThey have said they will save \u00a35bn by cracking down on tax avoidance, \u00a313bn from departmental spending and \u00a312bn from welfare. But there remain big unanswered questions on which benefits and which government projects will have to be axed.\nLiberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as \"economically illiterate\", but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was \"a very dangerous man\" because of his plan to balance the books by spending cuts alone.\nOne of the biggest changes coming into force on Monday is the relaxation of pension rules, so that those with a defined contribution pension \"pot\" can take out as much as they like when they reach the age of 55.\nLiberal Democrat Pensions Minister Steve Webb said the principle was to trust people with their own money - but he urged people to seek advice and not rush into any decisions.\nThis election issue includes income tax and national insurance levies and business taxes.\nLabour's pensions spokesman Gregg McClymont welcomed the \"flexibility\" in the new system but voiced concerns the pensions industry was \"finding it difficult to adapt so quickly to such a big change\".\nOther changes coming into effect include a higher limit on ISA savings, the Marriage Tax Allowance, a 2.5% increase in the state pension, the abolition of employer National Insurance on under 21-year-olds and the scrapping of the 10p tax band on savings. Working age benefit increases have also been capped at 1%.\nThe Conservatives have produced Treasury figures suggesting 94% of households will be better off under the changes, with 92% of pensioner households also gaining.

    "40564245": "According to CNN, the former FBI director and his team of crack investigators were caught somewhat flat-footed by the recent email revelations. They were believed to have been focusing their attention on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, son-in-law Jared Kushner and former campaign chair Paul Manafort, among others.\nAs it turns out, the first bit of concrete public evidence that someone in the president's inner circle might be open to Russian assistance in the presidential election involved Mr Trump's eldest son.\nThe president, Trump Jr and his administration have quickly reformed their defences and are now dismissing the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya last June as a minor event during a hurly-burly political season, largely lost in the fog of time, that led to nothing and which they have been admirably \"transparent\" in discussing.\nKey members of Congress seem to think otherwise, with senators like Republican Susan Collins of Maine calling for Trump Jr to be questioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa eager to bring Manafort before his Senate Judiciary Committee.\nBut while Congress gears up for more hearings, Mr Mueller operates quietly behind the scenes. Where might he look first? What threads, revealed in Trump Jr's emails, will he and his team tug on, to see what unravels?\nHere are a few of the tempting questions he might be tempted to ask.\nNestled toward the end of music publicist Goldstone's explosive first email to Trump Jr about the \"official documents and information\" the Russian government supposedly had about Hillary Clinton was that this constituted just \"part of\" Russia's support for his father, \"helped along by Aras and Emin\" Agalarov, the father-son Moscow-based real estate duo.\nIt's a rather stunning detail for Goldstone to have offhandedly mentioned - and one that Trump Jr, in his \"love it\" response, seems to have breezed past with no comment.\nThat kind of remark, however, would cause anyone looking for evidence of a Trump-Russia campaign collusion to stop dead in their tracks and ask: \"What's the rest of the story?\"\nWhy is this British guy emailing Trump Jr?\nEven if one takes Veselnitskaya at her word that she is not an agent of the Russian government and did not know or provide any damaging information about Mrs Clinton to the Trump team during the 9 June meeting, her own recent admissions raise some pressing questions.\nOn Tuesday she told an NBC interviewer that Trump Jr, Manafort and Kushner may have been \"longing for\" the dirt on their Democratic opponent.\n\"They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted,\" she said.\nIn other words, Veselnitskaya walked out of that meeting in New York with the belief that Mr Trump's campaign both was desperately seeking damaging information about Mrs Clinton and were open to talking to Russian nationals about what they might have to offer.\nGiven that Veselnitskaya is at the very least a well-connected figure in Moscow, it doesn't require a great leap of faith to think this information eventually made its way to the Russian government. If the US intelligence community is to be believed, that government soon would acquire a trove of damaging information about Mrs Clinton and the Democrats as a result of hacks it co-ordinated into the Democratic National Committee server and the personal email of a senior member of Mrs Clinton's campaign team.\nIn the ensuing months, details from those hacks would be made public via Wikileaks at times that were particularly damaging to Mrs Clinton.\nDerogatory statements about Mrs Clinton's Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders were produced the week before Democrats gathered for their national convention. Transcripts of Mrs Clinton's paid speeches to Goldman Sachs were published just days before the final presidential debate - and cited during that showdown by Mr Trump himself.\nThe Trump campaign wanted dirt on Mrs Clinton. The Russian government had it in spades. Mr Mueller might want to see if those dots can be connected.\nAnother choice tidbit in that first Goldstone email was his suggestion that he might \"send this info to your father via Rhona\" - a reference to Rhona Graff, the elder Trump's personal assistant.\nGraff has served as the gatekeeper to Mr Trump at the Trump organisation - and, according to a profile in Politico, still is the preferred method for the president's business associates to contact him outside of White House channels.\n\"If I really wanted to whisper something in his ear, I would probably go to Rhona,\" Trump business associate John Catsimatidis told the publication.\nThe White House has said that Mr Trump did not know about the meeting with Veselnitskaya - despite the fact that his son, son-in-law and campaign chief were in attendance and it took place in his New York tower.\nIf this assertion is proven to be inaccurate, Rhona could be the key.\nTrump Jr meeting scandal: The key players\nThe middle portion of the email chain released on Tuesday morning involved Trump Jr and Goldstone trying to set up a phone conversation with Russian pop star/businessman Emin Agalarov.\nAfter a fair bit of wrangling the two apparently spoke, and the very next email was Goldstone informing Trump Jr he was scheduling the meeting with the \"Russian government attorney\" (Veselnitskaya) for later in the week.\nMr Mueller and congressional investigators may be interested in learning what Agalarov said that convinced Mr Trump to move ahead with the plans for a face-to-face gathering.\nAnd what was the nature of the relationship between Agalarov and the Trump clan, in light of Goldstone's observation that Emin and his father were helping Russia's support of the Trump campaign?\nDid Donald Trump Jr break the law?\nFour days after the first email from Goldstone to Trump Jr about the incriminating information the Russia government was said to have about Mrs Clinton, candidate Trump promised to give a \"major speech\" the following week discussing \"all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons\", including Mrs Clinton's alleged misdeeds while serving as secretary of state.\n\"I think you're going to find it very informative and very, very interesting,\" he added.\nThat speech, originally announced for the Monday after the Trump camp's New York meeting with Veselnitskaya, never took place.\nWas this an indication that the elder Trump may have known about the meeting - which, according to Trump Jr, did not produce the promised dirt on Mrs Clinton?\nThat's one more question Mr Mueller might be mulling.\nFollow Anthony Zurcher on Twitter.",

    "33245830": "There did not appear to be any obvious link between them, but the group of five were indeed connected - by a dark, despicable secret.\nThroughout the 1970s and 80s, they operated an \"abhorrent\" predatory paedophile ring in the Wrexham area of north Wales.\nThey targeted and preyed on vulnerable children aged between 10 and 15, in a \"systematic and devious manner\" before repeatedly abusing them and passing them from one abuser to the next.\n\"On some occasions, victims were given alcohol before the abuse took place,\" said Ed Beltrami, chief crown prosecutor for Wales.\n\"That's the whole nature of a paedophile ring; they pick on people who have vulnerability, they don't necessarily have a very stable home life and people looking after them so they are prey to offenders of this nature.\n\"Once they're into the ring then they are passed around from one offender to the other. \"\nThe five men - two other defendants; retired teacher Roger Griffiths, 76, from Wrexham, and ex-slaughterman Keith Stokes from Farndon, Cheshire, were cleared of all charges - must have felt confident they would never be held to account for the young lives they had broken.\nAfter all, they remembered a time when sex abuse claims against men, often in positions of influence, were routinely dismissed out of hand and not taken seriously.\nBut the two-month trial at Mold Crown Court is a reminder of how things have changed.\nNow, complaints of abuse - no matter how long ago - are treated differently. They are taken seriously.\nRumours of a paedophile ring in Wrexham were nothing new. They had been circulating for years.\nIn 2000, the Waterhouse inquiry into physical and sexual abuse in north Wales children's homes acknowledged its existence.\n\"Twenty-five years ago, when I was first involved in digging this up, there was almost like a wall of silence,\" said Malcolm King, a Wrexham councillor who has been instrumental in exposing abuse of children in care.\n\"There was almost a disbelief that this sort of evil could be going on in our midst without us ever knowing about it.\"\n\"So breaking that dam of disbelief has been one of the important things that has happened over the past quarter of a century.\n\"But there's still much more to be done because the evidence is that there are hundreds and hundreds of people who've been abused that have never come forward, often abuse within their own families.\n\"But nevertheless, people remain silent with the most terrible things having been done to them.\"\nMr King and officers on the National Crime Agency's Operation Pallial team - set up in 2012 after Home Secretary Theresa May ordered an investigation into claims of previously overlooked child abuse in north Wales - have repeatedly paid tribute to the five victims.\nThe stress of facing their nightmare past, raking up excruciating memories and of being branded liars by the very men who brutalised them, can only be imagined.\n\"There is no forensic evidence - it's far too late for that,\" explains Mr Beltrami.\n\"No phone evidence, no CCTV, the usual supporting evidence is not available in a case of this nature so it comes down in the end to the oral testimony of the witnesses and of course the defendants have their say and it's for the jury to make up their mind whether they can be sure on the evidence they hear.\"\nThe victims told the jury how they had been abused mostly at the home of Gary Cooke - also known as Mark Grainger - who has a string of sex convictions.\nAt the time, he worked as a professional wrestler and ran a sex shop. He was also the ringleader of the gang of paedophiles.\nHe had taken in two lodgers - Neil Phoenix and local radio personality Roy Norry - who exploited his local celebrity status to ensnare his victims.\nTogether with civil servant Edward Huxley, they met former singer David Lightfoot who ran a bar in the town centre called Snowy's.\nHere, the gang also gathered young boys to abuse.\nThe grooming tactics adopted by the abusers have been described as \"carefully planned and single minded\" and continued over their victims' childhoods.\n\"They were clearly vulnerable young people,\" said Ian Mulcahey, senior investigating officer with the National Crime Agency.\n\"They were targeted because of that reason. They were taken into this network of people and it's been difficult to escape that cycle.\"\nVerdicts\nHe added: \"They accessed their victims in a variety of ways. Some by chance meeting, then they've groomed them and  built up levels of trust.\n\"They've plied them with alcohol, they've given them attention. These were very vulnerable young boys. They've played on that vulnerability.\"\nThe men took them on car trips, provided pornography, drugs, drink and sometimes money. Some of the boys would then introduce their friends to the men.\n\"I think the victims are incredibly brave,\" Mr Beltrami added.\n\"They have suffered over a very long period of time.\n\"It's not easy to come along and give evidence of sexual offences that have been committed against you in your childhood, particularly going through the criminal process with someone else coming along with suggestions that you're making it up. That's a hard process.\"\n\"Whilst the criminal justice process cannot put right the wrongs committed by these individuals, we hope that the victims will take some solace in knowing that their abusers have been brought to justice.\"\nSo the latest chapter in the scandal of child abuse in north Wales, both inside and outside the care system in the 70s and 80s, comes to a close.\nConnections with some of these men can be made with other known paedophiles.\nCooke once worked for notorious paedophile John Allen, who ran children's homes in north Wales and was jailed for life in 2014.\nThere is evidence that they preyed on the same victims.\nAs talk of conspiracies and establishment cover-ups continue, and as Operation Pallial presses on with its quest to expose historical child abuse in the region - it is fair to say this is unlikely to be the last we hear of this episode of north Wales's dark and shameful past.",
    "39243601": "For the Scots and their much talked-about revival, this was perspective. Way, way too much perspective. It wasn't just a slap in the face, it was a kick to the solar plexus and a proper shoeing in the aftermath.\nA record hiding. A shellacking to end all shellackings. Swing Low Sweet Chariot rung out around Twickenham in the last minutes, a hymn to a thunderously impressive team as they laid siege to the Scottish line in pursuit of an even bigger victory over Scotland than the one they  had - which was already the biggest of all time.\nThey got over for their seventh try with the last play and they deserved it. Sixty-one points. For the Scots, it was a form of sporting torture.\nThe surreal thing is that Scotland's unrelenting Kafkaesque nightmare began after just two minutes when Fraser Brown was put in the bin. While he was there, the game was won and lost. Just like that.\nEnglish power, English pace, English points. Lots and lots of them. Eddie Jones did his stuff. In this Six Nations there hasn't been much, if any, evidence of frailties in the Scotland midfield but Jones saw some and, Lord, how England executed.\nThey threw a dummy runner at Alex Dunbar and Huw Jones, a little bit of deception that created a very large hole and the opening try for Jonathan Joseph. Scotland were spooked now. The might of Twickenham closed in on them. Stuart Hogg dropped a high ball and a minute later it was 10-0. Brown came back on to the field, overthrew his first line-out and suddenly it was 13-0.\nThen it all got weird as well as woeful. Hogg disappeared for a head injury assessment and wasn't seen again - another colossal blow to Scotland's morale.\nMark Bennett came on, got injured after a few minutes and then went off again. Tommy Seymour was now playing full-back, Ali Price was on the right wing, Henry Pyrgos was scrum-half. Deckchairs. Rearranged. Titanic.\nJoseph raced through the Scottish midfield for a second one-phase try after 25 minutes and in that moment a giant jumbo jet appeared in the skies above Twickenham. Metaphorically, the visiting fans were on it. In body they were still there cheering their team. In mind, they were out of there.\nGordon Reid's try wasn't so much of a sign of a comeback as a consolation. After half an hour. And even when the prop blasted over, and Russell converted, Scotland's death-wish kicked in again.\nMore Scottish indiscipline gave Farrell another shot at goal and the centre knocked over his kick. At 23-7 the Scots were on the canvas. The misery was in seeing them having to get up only to get knocked down again.\nTwo minutes after Farrell's penalty, Joseph plunged the knife deeper, exposing the midfield defence and teeing-up Anthony Watson. That was just before half-time. Just after, Joseph got his hat-trick. A third single-phase score, a continuation of the catastrophe.\nEngland were an angry and focused team. All the chat about their slow starts to games was dynamited to kingdom come, all the talk about them having not played particularly well in this Six Nations was consigned to the rubbish bin. This was a mighty response. A vicious deconstruction of Scotland's momentum.\nAnother injury hit them early in the second half. Of course it did. Seymour went off, Duncan Weir came on and he became Scotland's third full-back of the day. Soon after, Farrell's boot brought up the 40 for England.\nGod help them, but Scotland did their best to fight the inevitable. They tried to play, tried to avoid the concession of the kind of Twickenham points mountain that would have broken records. Jones scored, but England stirred again and Billy Vunipola replied. Jones scored again and like a cat with a mouse England responded, Danny Care bringing up the half-century that put this victory into the history books.\nSix tries and it could have been seven had it not been for a Jones try-saver on Watson. Scotland wanted the whistle now - they wanted it from midway through the first half if truth be told - but they didn't hear it.\nThey were out on their feet, the English substitutes coming on and turning the screw, piling on the grief like the best teams do. No let-up, no throttling down on the power. This is how champions behave - and England are fine, fine champions.\nThey went for their seventh try and their 60th point as if they needed it like they needed their last breath. They camped themselves on the Scottish line, put them through scrum upon scrum, defence upon defence. For the weary visitors, it was torture. Physical and mental.\nCare got that seventh score to complete the jaw-dropping rout. Nobody could see this coming. Nobody. Scotland came here in search of a dream. In the end, it was their worst kind of nightmare.",

The circumstances are often complicated and this can lead to extremely difficult sentencing decisions. Fatalities have a huge impact on families and local communities.\n\"Environmental and wildlife issues have particular significance in Scotland relevant to tourism, rural industry and the local economy.

    "40741545": "If confirmed, the \"exomoon\" is likely to be about the size and mass of Neptune, and circles a planet the size of Jupiter but with 10 times the mass.\nThe signal was detected by Nasa's Kepler Space Telescope; astronomers now plan to carry out follow-up observations with Hubble in October.\nA paper about the candidate moon is published on the Arxiv pre-print site.\nTo date, astronomers have discovered more than 3,000 exoplanets - worlds orbiting stars other than the Sun.\nA hunt for exomoons - objects in orbit around those distant planets - has proceeded in parallel. But so far, these extrasolar satellites have lingered at the limits of detection with current techniques.\nDr David Kipping, assistant professor of astronomy at Columbia University in New York, says he has spent \"most of his adult life\" looking for exomoons.\nFor the time being, however, he urged caution, saying: \"We would merely describe it at this point as something consistent with a moon, but, who knows, it could be something else.\"\nThe Kepler telescope hunts for planets by looking for tiny dips in the brightness of a star when a planet crosses in front - known as a transit. To search for exomoons, researchers are looking for a dimming of starlight before and after the planet causes its dip in light.\nThe promising signal was observed during three transits - fewer than the astronomers would like to have in order to confidently announce a discovery.\nThe work by Dr Kipping, his Columbia colleague Alex Teachey and citizen scientist Allan R Schmitt, assigns a confidence level of four sigma to the signal from the distant planetary system. The confidence level describes how unlikely it is that an experimental result is simply down to chance. If you express it in terms of tossing a coin, it's equivalent to tossing 15 heads in row.\nBut Dr Kipping said this is not the best way to gauge the potential detection.\nHe told BBC News: \"We're excited about it... statistically, formally, it's a very high probability. But do we really trust the statistics? That's something unquantifiable. Until we get the measurements from Hubble, it may as well be 50-50 in my mind.\"\nThe candidate moon is known as Kepler-1625b I and is observed around a star that lies some 4,000 light-years from Earth. On account of its large size, team members have dubbed it a \"Nept-moon\".\nA current theory of planetary formation suggests such an object is unlikely to have formed in place with its Jupiter-mass planet, but would instead be an object captured by the gravity of the planet later on in the evolution of this planetary system.\nThe researchers could find no predictions of a Neptune-sized moon in the literature, but Dr Kipping notes that nothing in physics prevents one.\nA handful of possible candidates have come to light in the past, but none as yet has been confirmed.\n\"I'd say it's the best [candidate] we've had,\" Dr Kipping told me.\n\"Almost every time we hit a candidate, and it passes our tests, we invent more tests until it finally dies - until it fails one of the tests... in this case we've applied everything we've ever done and it's passed all of those tests. On the other hand, we only have three events.\"\nThe work by Dr Kipping and colleagues forms part of the Hunt for Exomooons with Kepler (HEK) collaboration.\nFollow Paul on Twitter.",
